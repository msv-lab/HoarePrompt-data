Postcondition: `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `arr[i]` is equal to `nums[0]`, where `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by the new value of `arr[i]`. If the current value of `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to `False`. If `nums` is already sorted, `ans` remains unchanged.
