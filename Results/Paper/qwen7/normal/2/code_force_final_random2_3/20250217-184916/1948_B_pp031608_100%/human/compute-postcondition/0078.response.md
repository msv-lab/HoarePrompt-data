Output State: **`m` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user, `ans` is True**

The code simply reassigns the variable `ans` to `True`, which does not affect the values of `m`, `i`, `arr`, or `ans`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
