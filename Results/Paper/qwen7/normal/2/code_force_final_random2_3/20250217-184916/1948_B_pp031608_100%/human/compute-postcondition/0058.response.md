Output State: **`m` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `arr[i]` is either equal to `arr[i - 1]` (if `arr[i]` is not less than `arr[i - 1]`), or `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]` and `nums` is a list containing the digits of the new `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, `nums` is updated to include the digits of `arr[i-1]` followed by the digits of `arr[i]`, `ans` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
