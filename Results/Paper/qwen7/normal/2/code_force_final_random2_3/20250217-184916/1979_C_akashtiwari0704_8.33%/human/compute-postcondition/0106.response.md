Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `bets`.

2. **Determine the initial values of these variables**:
   - `i` is already given as `0`.
   - `bets` is a positive integer and must be at least 3.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < bets`.
   - Given `i = 0` and `bets` being a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, the condition `i < bets` will be true initially.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is already set to `0`, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - We need to ensure that `bets` is a positive integer and at least 3.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `bets` must be a positive integer and at least 3.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`bets` must be a positive integer and at least 3**
