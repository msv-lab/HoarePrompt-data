Postcondition: **`T` is `bets`, `bets` must be a positive integer and greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `0`, `prod` is the product of all elements in the list `a` up to index `bets-1`, `sumo` is the sum of `prod // a[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `bets-1`, `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `bets-1`, and `sumo` is less than `prod`**
