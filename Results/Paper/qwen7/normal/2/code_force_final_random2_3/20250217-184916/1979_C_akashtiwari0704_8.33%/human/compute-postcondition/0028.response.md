Postcondition: `t` is 0, `bets` is the length of the list `a`, `i` is equal to `bets`, `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]` for each valid index `i` from 0 to `bets-1`, `sumo` is less than `prod` and contains the sum of the updated values of `a[i]` for each valid index `i` from 0 to `bets-1`, each converted to an integer.
