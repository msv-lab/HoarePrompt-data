Output State: **`t` is 0, `bets` is the length of the list `a`, `i` is `i + 1`, `a[i]` is `prod // a[i]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a[i]` to be the integer division of `prod` by `a[i]`. The other variables (`t`, `bets`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `bets` is still the length of the list `a`, and `i` is still `i + 1`.
