Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `bets`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < bets`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `ans` is 'a[0]'
4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 1 for the next iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `bets`. Therefore, `bets` must be greater than 1.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is 1
- `bets` must be greater than 1

So, the updated state is:

State: **`i` is 1, `ans` is 'a[0]', `bets` must be greater than 1**
