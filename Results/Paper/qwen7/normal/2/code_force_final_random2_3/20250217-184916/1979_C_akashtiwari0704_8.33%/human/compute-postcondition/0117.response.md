Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer `t` and a list `k` containing `n` positive integers. It calculates the product of the elements in `k`, then divides this product by each element in `k` to generate a new list. It sums the elements of this new list. If the sum is greater than or equal to the original product, it prints `-1`; otherwise, it prints the elements of the new list separated by spaces.**
