Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive.**

The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, the value of `t` remains within this range after the input operation. The other variables (`n` and `k`) are not affected by this code snippet.
