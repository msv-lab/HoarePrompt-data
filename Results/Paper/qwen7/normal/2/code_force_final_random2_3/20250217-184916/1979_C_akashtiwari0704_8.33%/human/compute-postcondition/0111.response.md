Output State: **`bets` is a positive integer and at least 3, `i` is `bets` - 2, `ans` is the string value of `a[bets - 1]` followed by `a[i]` and a space.**

Explanation: The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of `a[i]` (where `i` is `bets - 1 - 1` or `bets - 2`) followed by a space to the existing value of `ans`. Initially, `ans` is the string value of `a[bets - 1]` followed by a space. After executing the code, `ans` will be updated to include the additional string value of `a[bets - 2]` followed by a space. The values of `bets` and `i` remain unchanged except that `i` is decremented by 1.
