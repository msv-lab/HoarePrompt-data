Output State: `bets` must be at least 3, `i` is equal to `bets`, `ans` is a string containing the concatenation of all elements in `a` separated by spaces.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `bets` will be the final length of the list `a`, `i` will be equal to `bets` (since the loop increments `i` and stops when `i` equals `bets`), and `ans` will be a string that contains every element of the list `a`, with each element followed by a space.
