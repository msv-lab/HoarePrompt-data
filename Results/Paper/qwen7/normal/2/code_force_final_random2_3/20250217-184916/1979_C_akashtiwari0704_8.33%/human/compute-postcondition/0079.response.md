Output State: **`T` is `bets`, `bets` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The initial value of `T` is `bets`. The code changes the value of `bets` to an integer obtained from user input. Since the exact input value is not specified, we represent it as `bets` being an input integer. The value of `T` remains unchanged as it was initially.
