Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(bets)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `bets`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is 0
   - `bets` is the length of the list `a`
   - `i` is incremented by 1
   - `sumo` is the sum of `a[i]` converted to an integer plus the previous value of `sumo`

3. **Understand the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `bets`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, let's denote the new value of `i` as `i_new = i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i_new` must be less than `bets`. Therefore, `i` (which is `i_new - 1`) must be less than `bets`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `t` remains 0 because it is not affected by the loop.
   - `bets` remains the length of the list `a` because it does not change within the loop.
   - `i` is now `i + 1`.
   - `sumo` is updated but its exact value is not needed for the loop condition.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t` is 0, `bets` is the length of the list `a`, `i` is `i + 1`, `bets` must be greater than `i + 1`**.
