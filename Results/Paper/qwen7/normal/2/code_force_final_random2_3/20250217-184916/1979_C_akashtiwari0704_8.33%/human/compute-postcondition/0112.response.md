Output State: **`bets` is a positive integer and at least 3, `i` is `bets` - 1, `ans` is the string value of `a[0]` concatenated with the string values of all `a[i]` for `i` from `0` to `bets-1` separated by spaces.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `bets` will still be a positive integer and at least 3. The variable `i` will be set to `bets - 1`. The string `ans` will contain the concatenation of the string representations of all elements in the list `a` from index `0` to `bets-1`, each followed by a space.
