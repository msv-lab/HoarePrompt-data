Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(bets)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `bets`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `bets` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `sumo` is increased by `int(a[0])`.
   - `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]`.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - The value of `bets` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise within the loop body, but since no such change is mentioned, `bets` remains the same.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `bets` must still be greater than 0.
- `i` will be 2.
- `sumo` is increased by `int(a[0])` (this does not change between iterations).
- `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]` (this does not change between iterations).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`bets` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `sumo` is increased by `int(a[0])`, `a[i]` is equal to `prod // a[i]`**
