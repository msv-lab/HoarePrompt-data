Output State: **`i` is 0; `ans` is 'a[0] '**

Explanation: The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` updates the variable `ans` by concatenating the string representation of `a[i]` (where `i` is 0) to the current value of `ans`. Since `i` is 0, `a[i]` refers to the first element of the list `a`. Given the initial state, `ans` is updated to include the string representation of `a[0]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as no operation modifies it.
