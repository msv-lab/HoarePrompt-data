Output State: **`mak` is 2, `i` is 2, `pans` is a list of integers from `n-1` to `0`, `mak2` is 0, `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed.**

Explanation: The variable `mak` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. All other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed is still valid.
