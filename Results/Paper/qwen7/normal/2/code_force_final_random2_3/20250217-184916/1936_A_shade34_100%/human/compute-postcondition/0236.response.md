Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(1, len(pans)):`.
   - The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `len(pans)`.

2. **Understand the Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.
   - The loop continues as long as `i < len(pans)`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `mak` is `n-1`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `pans` is a list containing all the values of `i` from 0 to `n-1` inclusive.
   - `len(pans)` must be `n`.

4. **Determine the New State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `i` would be `n-1 + 1 = n`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(pans)`.
   - Given that `i` is currently `n-1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(pans)`, which means `len(pans)` must be `n`.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will be updated to `n` in the next iteration.
   - `len(pans)` must remain `n` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` will be `n`.
- `len(pans)` must remain `n`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`mak` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `pans` is a list containing all the values of `i` from 0 to `n-1` inclusive, and `len(pans)` must be `n`.**
