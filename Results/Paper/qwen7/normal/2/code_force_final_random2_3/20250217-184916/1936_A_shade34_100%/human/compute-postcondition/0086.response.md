Output State: **`mak` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `len(pans) - 2`, `pans` is a list of integers from `n-1` to `0`, `mak2` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed `len(pans)` times**.

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it now holds the integer value entered by the user. All other variables retain their previous states. The precondition that `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed `len(pans)` times remains unchanged.
