Output State: **`mak` is `n-1`, `i` is `1`, `pans` is `[0]`, `mak2` is `n-1`, the current value of the input string `s` is `=`, `n` is an input integer, the current value of the input string is `=`**

Explanation: The line `pans.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` (which is 0) to the list `pans`. After appending, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` becomes 1, and `pans` becomes `[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
