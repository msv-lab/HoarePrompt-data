Postcondition: **`mak` is 3, `i` is 3, `pans` is a list containing the integers from 0 to n-1 inclusive, `mak2` is n-1, the current value of the input string `s` is an input from the user (it could be either '<' or '=' for the next iteration), `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called 2*n-1 times, and the condition `s == '>'` is false based on the input received during the last iteration.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the input string `s` equals '>' or not, the values of `mak`, `i`, `pans`, `mak2`, and the behavior of `sys.stdout.flush()` remain unchanged from the precondition, and the condition `s == '>'` remains false based on the input received during the last iteration.
