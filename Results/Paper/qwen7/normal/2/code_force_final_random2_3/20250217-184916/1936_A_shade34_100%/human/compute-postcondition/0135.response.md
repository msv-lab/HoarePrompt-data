Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `n` is described as being greater than 3 but no explicit value is given for `n`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 3.
- `mak` and `mak2` are not defined or given any explicit values in the initial state.

Since `mak` and `mak2` are not defined, they will retain their default values, which in Python are `None`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **'? None None 3 None'**
