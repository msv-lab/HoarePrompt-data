Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `s` is a string.
   - `pans` is a list containing the value of `n`.
   - If `s` is the string '<', then `mak` is also equal to `n`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is `n`.
- `mak` is equal to `n` because `s` is the string '<'.
- `mak2` is not defined in the initial state, so it must be `None` or undefined. Since no other value is assigned to `mak2`, we assume it is `None`.

Given these points, let's substitute the known values into the print statement:
- `'?'` is a constant string.
- `mak` is `n`.
- `mak2` is `None`.
- `i` is `n`.
- `mak2` is `None`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **'? n None n None'**
