Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i_prev + 2`, `s` is the new string input by the user, `pans` is a list with the value of `i` appended, and the standard output buffer is flushed. If `s` is equal to '<', `mak` is equal to `i`. Otherwise, `pans` is a list containing the value of `i`.
