Based on the initial state provided:

- `mak` is 1
- `i` is 2
- `pans` is a list containing the integers from 0 to n-1 inclusive
- `mak2` is n-1
- The current value of the input string `s` is an input from the user (it could be either '<' or '=' for the next iteration)
- `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called 2*n-1 times
- The condition `s == '>'` is true based on the input received during the last iteration.

Given that `s == '>'` is true, let's break down the print statement:

```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

- `pans[mak]` will be `pans[1]`, which is 1 (since `pans` contains integers from 0 to n-1).
- `pans[i]` will be `pans[2]`, which is 2 (since `pans` contains integers from 0 to n-1).

So, the print statement will output:

Output: **? 1 1 2 2**
