Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the initial conditions**:
   - `mak` is either 0 or 1.
   - `i` is either 1 or 2.
   - `pans` is either `[0, 1]` or `[0]`.
   - `mak2` is `n-1`.
   - The current value of the input string `s` is an input from the user.
   - `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called `n+1` times.
   - The condition `s == '<'` is true.

3. **Determine the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the states based on the loop condition**:
   - Since `i` is either 1 or 2, and the loop continues as long as `i < n`, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.
   - After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, if `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 2 at the start of the next iteration. If `i` was 2, the loop would terminate because `i` would no longer be less than `n`.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so if `i` was 1, it will become 2; if `i` was 2, the loop will terminate.
   - `n` must remain greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

6. **Final state**:
   - `mak` remains unchanged (either 0 or 1).
   - `i` becomes 2 (if it was 1) or the loop terminates.
   - `pans` remains unchanged (either `[0, 1]` or `[0]`).
   - `mak2` remains `n-1`.
   - The current value of the input string `s` remains unchanged.
   - `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called `n+1` times, so this count remains unchanged.
   - The condition `s == '<'` remains true.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `mak` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 2, `pans` is either [0, 1] or [0], `mak2` is `n-1`, the current value of the input string `s` is an input from the user, `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called `n+1` times, and the condition `s == '<'` is true.**
