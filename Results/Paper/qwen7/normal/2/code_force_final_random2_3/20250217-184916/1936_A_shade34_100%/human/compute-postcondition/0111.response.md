Based on the initial state provided:

- `mak` is `n-1`
- `i` is `0`
- `pans` is an empty list
- `mak2` is `n-1`
- `n` is an input integer
- The current value of the input string is `<`
- `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called `n` times

When the print statement `print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)` is executed, it will print the following:

- The first argument is the string `'?'`
- The second argument is the value of `mak`, which is `n-1`
- The third argument is the value of `mak2`, which is also `n-1`
- The fourth argument is the value of `i`, which is `0`

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **'? n-1 n-1 0'**
