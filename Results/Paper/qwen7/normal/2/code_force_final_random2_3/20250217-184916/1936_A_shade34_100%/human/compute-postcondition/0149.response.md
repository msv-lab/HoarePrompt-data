Based on the initial state provided:

- `mak` is 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `pans` is a list containing the integers from 0 to \(n-1\) inclusive.
- `mak2` is \(n-1\).
- The current value of the input string `s` is an input from the user (either '<' or '=' for the last iteration).
- `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called \(2n-1\) times.
- The condition `s == '<'` or `s == '='` is true based on the input received during the last iteration.

Given these conditions, let's break down the `print` statement:

```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

1. `pans[mak]`: Since `mak` is 0, this refers to the first element of the list `pans`, which is 0.
2. `pans[mak]`: Again, since `mak` is 0, this also refers to the first element of the list `pans`, which is 0.
3. `pans[i]`: Since `i` is 1, this refers to the second element of the list `pans`, which is 1.
4. `pans[i]`: Similarly, since `i` is 1, this also refers to the second element of the list `pans`, which is 1.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output:

Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
