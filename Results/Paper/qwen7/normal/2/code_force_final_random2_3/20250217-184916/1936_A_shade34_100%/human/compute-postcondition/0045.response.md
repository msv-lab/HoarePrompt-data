Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a new string from input, `pans` is a list containing the values `[i, n]`, and `mak` is equal to `n`.**

Explanation: The code `pans.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `pans`. Since `i` is equal to `n`, `pans` now contains both `i` and `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
