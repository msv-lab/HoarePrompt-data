Postcondition: **`mak` is 0, `i` is 0, `pans` is a list containing 0, `mak2` is `n-1`, the current value of the input string `s` is `<`, `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called `n` times, and the condition `s == '<'` is true if `s` is `<`; otherwise, `mak` is `n-1`, `i` is 1, `pans` is `[0]`, and the current value of the input string `s` is `=`.**
