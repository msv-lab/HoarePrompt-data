Output State: **`mak` is `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list of integers from `n-1` to `0`, `mak2` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer, the current value of the input string is `<`, `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called `n` times.**

Explanation: The line `mak2 = mak` simply assigns the value of `mak` to `mak2`. Since `mak` was previously set to `n-1`, `mak2` is now also `n-1`. All other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `mak2` along with the unchanged values of `mak`, `i`, `pans`, `n`, the input string, and the number of times `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called.
