Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `n`
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `s` is a new string from input
   - `pans` is a list containing either `[i]` or `[i, n]` depending on whether `s` is equal to '<' or not
   - `mak` is equal to `i` if `s` is not '<', or equal to `n` if `s` is '<'

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently equal to `n`, the loop condition `i < n` will be false, and the loop will not execute again.
   - Therefore, no changes are needed for `i` and `n` to proceed.

5. **Consider other variables**:
   - `s`, `pans`, and `mak` are not part of the loop head, so their values remain unchanged.

Given this analysis, the state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time because the loop condition is already false.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a new string from input, `pans` is a list containing either `[i]` or `[i, n]` depending on whether `s` is equal to '<' or not, and `mak` is equal to `i` if `s` is not '<', or equal to `n` if `s` is '<'**
