Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the same as before, `b` has a new element which is `a[l]`, `l` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `b`) remain unchanged from their previous states. The new element added to `b` is still `a[l]`, but now `l` has been incremented.
