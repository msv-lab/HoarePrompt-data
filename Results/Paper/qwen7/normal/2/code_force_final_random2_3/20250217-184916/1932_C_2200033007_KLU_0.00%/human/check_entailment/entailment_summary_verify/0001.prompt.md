You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v
        ans.append(p)
    return reversed(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of `n` positive integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'). It constructs a new list `b` by appending elements from the start or end of list `a` based on the instructions in string `s`. Then, it calculates the cumulative product of the elements in the reversed list `b`, storing each intermediate product value in a list `ans`. Finally, it returns a reversed list of these intermediate product values, starting from the product of all elements in `b` down to the product of the first element of `b`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by the array `a` and the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is supposed to process the commands and compute the remainders.
   - However, the logic inside `func_1` does not match the problem description. Specifically:
     - It incorrectly processes the commands by appending elements to the list `b` instead of computing the product of the array elements and taking the remainder.
     - It does not compute the product of the array elements and take the remainder at each step as required.
     - Instead, it appends elements to `b` based on the direction ('L' or 'R') but does not compute the product or take the remainder.

3. **Computing the Product and Remainder:**
   - The program should compute the product of the remaining elements of the array after each command and take the remainder with `m`.
   - The current implementation does not do this; it only appends elements to `b` and then computes their product in reverse order, which is not what the problem requires.

### Correct Implementation

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    ans = []
    product = 1
    for i in range(n):
        # Compute the product of the current state of the array
        for j in range(i):
            product = (product * a[j]) % m
        # Process the command
        if s[i] == 'L':
            a.pop(0)
        else:
            a.pop()
        # Append the remainder of the product to the result list
        ans.append(product)
    return ans
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code

1. **Initialization:**
   - `product` is initialized to 1.
   - `ans` is used to store the results.

2. **Loop through Commands:**
   - For each command, update the `product` by multiplying the current state of the array and taking the remainder with `m`.
   - Depending on the command (`'L'` or `'R'`), remove the appropriate element from the array.
   - Append the current `product` to `ans`.

3. **Return Result:**
   - Return the list `ans` containing the remainders after each command.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the original program is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the product of the array elements and take the remainder at each step. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
