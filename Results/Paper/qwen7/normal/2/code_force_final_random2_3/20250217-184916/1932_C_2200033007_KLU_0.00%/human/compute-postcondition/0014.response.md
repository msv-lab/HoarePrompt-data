Output State: **`s` is a string, `i` is an index within the bounds of `s`, `b` is a list containing the element `a[l+1]` if the character at index `i + 1` of string `s` is 'L', otherwise `b` contains the element `a[r-1]`; `l` is increased by 1.**

The value of `l` is incremented by 1, while the values of `s`, `i`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition for the list `b` remains the same based on the character at index `i + 1` of string `s`.
