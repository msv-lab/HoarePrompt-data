Output State: **`b` contains the element `a[r]`, `s[i]` is not equal to 'L'**.

Explanation: The code `b.append(a[r])` appends the element `a[r]` to the list `b`. The initial condition that `s[i]` is not equal to 'L' remains unchanged. Therefore, `b` now includes the element `a[r]`, and `s[i]` is still not equal to 'L'.
