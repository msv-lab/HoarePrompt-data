### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem. Let's break down the issues and verify the corrected implementation.

#### Issues in the Original Program:
1. **Incorrect Processing of Commands:**
   - The original program appends elements to the list `b` based on the direction ('L' or 'R') but does not compute the product of the array elements and take the remainder at each step.
   - This means the program does not follow the logic specified in the problem statement, where it should compute the product of the remaining elements and take the remainder modulo `m` at each step.

2. **Incorrect Computation of the Product:**
   - The original program computes the product of all elements in the reversed list `b` and appends these products to the list `ans`. This is not the same as computing the product of the remaining elements of the array after each command.

#### Corrected Program:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `product` is initialized to 1.
   - `ans` is used to store the results.

2. **Loop through Commands:**
   - For each command, update the `product` by multiplying the current state of the array and taking the remainder with `m`.
   - Depending on the command (`'L'` or `'R'`), remove the appropriate element from the array.
   - Append the current `product` to `ans`.

3. **Return Result:**
   - Return the list `ans` containing the remainders after each command.

This corrected implementation ensures that the program correctly computes the product of the remaining elements of the array and takes the remainder modulo `m` at each step, as required by the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the detailed analysis and the corrected implementation, the original program is indeed incorrect. The corrected version accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement.

**Final: False**

The original program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement.
