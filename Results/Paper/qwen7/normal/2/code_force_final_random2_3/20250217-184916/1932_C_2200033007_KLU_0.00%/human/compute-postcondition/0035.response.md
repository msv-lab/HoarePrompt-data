Output State: **`p` is equal to `p` multiplied by the next value of `v` in the reversed sequence of `b`, `ans` contains `[p * v, p]`**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(p)` appends the current value of `p` to the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` contains `[p * v]`. After appending `p`, `ans` now contains both `p * v` and `p`, making it `[p * v, p]`. The value of `p` remains unchanged from its previous calculation, which was `p` multiplied by the next value of `v` in the reversed sequence of `b`.
