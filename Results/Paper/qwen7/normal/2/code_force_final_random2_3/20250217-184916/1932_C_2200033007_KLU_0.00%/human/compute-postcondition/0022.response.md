Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the same as before, `b` has a new element appended which is the value of `a[r]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `b.append(a[r])` appends the value of `a[r]` to the list `b`. Since no specific values are given for `a`, `r`, or `b`, we can only state that `b` now contains an additional element, which is `a[r]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
