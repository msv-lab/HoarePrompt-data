Output State: `p` will be equal to the product of all elements in the reversed list `b`, and `ans` will contain a list of `p` after each iteration of the loop, starting from the product of the last element of `b` up to the product of all elements in `b`.

In more detail, if `b` is a list with elements `[v1, v2, ..., vn]`, then after the loop completes, `p` will be equal to `v1 * v2 * ... * vn`. The list `ans` will contain the intermediate products `[p, p*v2, p*v2*v3, ..., p*v2*...*vn]`.
