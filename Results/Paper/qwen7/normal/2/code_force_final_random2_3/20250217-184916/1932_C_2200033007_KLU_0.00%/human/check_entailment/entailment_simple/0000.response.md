Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the necessary inputs: `n`, `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s`.
2. The `func_1` function processes the commands according to the problem statement:
   - It initializes pointers `l` and `r` to traverse the array `a` from the start and end, respectively.
   - It constructs the list `b` by appending elements from `a` based on the commands in `s`.
3. After constructing `b`, the function calculates the product of its elements in reverse order and appends these products to the list `ans`.
4. The function returns the reversed list of products, which matches the required output format.

Given the detailed explanation and the annotated program, the logic and implementation seem to align with the problem statement and the expected behavior. Therefore, the program should produce the correct output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
