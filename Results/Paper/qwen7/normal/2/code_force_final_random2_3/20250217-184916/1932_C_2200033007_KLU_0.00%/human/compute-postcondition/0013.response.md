Output State: **`s` is a string, `i` is an index within the bounds of `s`, `b` is a list containing the element `a[l+1]` if the character at index `i + 1` of string `s` is 'L', otherwise `b` contains the element `a[r-1]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends an element to the list `b`. The element appended is `a[l]` where `l` is incremented by 1 if the character at index `i + 1` of string `s` is 'L'. Otherwise, the element appended is `a[r-1]`. Since the initial state does not specify the values of `l` and `r`, they remain as they are, but their usage is defined based on the condition. The other variables (`s` and `i`) are not affected by this operation.
