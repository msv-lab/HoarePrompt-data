Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `totalOne` is the length of `pre`, `suffZero` is a list containing 0 and possibly additional elements based on the value of `el`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`, `oneInd` is the sum of `func_1(preOne, zr)` and `func_1(preOne, zr + 1)` - `func_1(preOne, 1)`**.

Explanation: The line `oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)` subtracts the value of `func_1(preOne, 1)` from `oneInd`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `oneInd` is the original value of `oneInd` minus `func_1(preOne, 1)`.
