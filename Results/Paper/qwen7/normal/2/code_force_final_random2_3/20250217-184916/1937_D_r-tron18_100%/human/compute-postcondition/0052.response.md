Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0 with the last element removed, `totalOne` is the length of `pre`, `suffZero` is a list containing 0 and possibly additional elements based on the value of `el`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `preOne.pop()` removes the last element from the list `preOne`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
