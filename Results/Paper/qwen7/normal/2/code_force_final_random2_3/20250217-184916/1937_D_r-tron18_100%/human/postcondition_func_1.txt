The function accepts a string `s1` consisting of characters '<' and '>' and an integer `n` representing the length of `s1`. It processes the string to compute a list `ans` of length `n`, where each element is calculated based on the positions of '>' characters in `s1`. After processing, it prints a list of zeros of length `n`.
