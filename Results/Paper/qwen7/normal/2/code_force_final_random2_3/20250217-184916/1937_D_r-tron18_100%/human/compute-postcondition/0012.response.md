Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `totalOne` is the length of `pre`, `suffZero` is a list containing 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `el` is the value of `s1[i]`, `el` equals '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, and `zeroInd` is calculated as 2 times the result of `func_1(suffZero, ol)` and the condition `ol <= zr` is true; `oneInd` is calculated as 2 times the last element of `preOne` minus the result of `func_1(preOne, 1)`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `oneInd` as `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`. Since `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums, its last element is the sum of all elements in `pre`. The function `func_1` is called with `preOne` and 1 as arguments, but its exact implementation is not provided, so we keep it as `func_1(preOne, 1)`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
