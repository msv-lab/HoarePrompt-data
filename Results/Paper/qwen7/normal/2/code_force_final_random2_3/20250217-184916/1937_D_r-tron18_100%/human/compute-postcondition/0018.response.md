Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `totalOne` is the length of `pre`, `suffZero` is a list containing 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `el` is '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `oneInd` is the sum of `func_1(preOne, zr)` and `func_1(preOne, zr + 1)` minus `func_1(preOne, 1)`, `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr), `ol` is greater than `zr`, `zeroInd` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code calculates `fi` as `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`. Since the exact values of `func_1` are not provided, `fi` is left as the expression `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
