Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `totalOne` is the length of `pre`, `suffZero` is a list containing 0 and then the previous last element plus `i + 1`, `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `el` is the value of `s1[i]`, and `el` is not equal to '>'**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of the last element in `suffZero` plus `i + 1` to `suffZero`. Given that `i` is `n - 2`, the new value appended to `suffZero` is `suffZero[-1] + (n - 2) + 1`, which simplifies to `suffZero[-1] + n - 1`. Since `suffZero` initially contains only 0, the new value appended is `0 + n - 1`, which is `n - 1`. Therefore, `suffZero` now contains `[0, n - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
