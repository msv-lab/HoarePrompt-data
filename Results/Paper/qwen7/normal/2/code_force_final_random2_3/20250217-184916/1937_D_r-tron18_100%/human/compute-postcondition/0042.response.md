Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `totalOne` is the length of `pre`, `suffZero` is a list containing 0 and possibly additional elements based on the value of `el`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`**.

Explanation: The line `zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)` calculates the value of `zeroInd` based on the function `func_1` applied to `suffZero` and `ol`. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `zeroInd`. However, we know that `zeroInd` is assigned the value of twice the result of `func_1(suffZero, ol)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
