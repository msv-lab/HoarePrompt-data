Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `totalOne` is the length of `pre`, `suffZero` is a list containing 0 and then the previous last element plus `i + 1`, `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `el` is the value of `s1[i]`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, len(suffZero) - 1)`**.

Explanation: The line `oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)` calculates `oneInd` as twice the result of calling `func_1` with `preOne` and `zr` (which is `len(suffZero) - 1`). The values of the other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
