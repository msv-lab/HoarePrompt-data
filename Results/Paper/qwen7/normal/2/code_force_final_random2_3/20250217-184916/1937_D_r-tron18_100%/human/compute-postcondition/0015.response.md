Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `totalOne` is the length of `pre`, `suffZero` is a list containing 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `el` is '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `ol` is greater than `zr`, `zeroInd` is 0**

Explanation: The code assigns `zeroInd` the value of `2 * suffZero[-1]`. Since `suffZero` is a list containing only one element (0), `suffZero[-1]` is 0. Therefore, `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * 0`, which results in 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
