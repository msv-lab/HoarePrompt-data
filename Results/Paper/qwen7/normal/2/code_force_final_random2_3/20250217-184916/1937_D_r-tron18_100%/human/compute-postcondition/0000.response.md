Output State: **`pre` is a list of integers where each integer i + 1 is the index position in `s1` where the character is '>', and `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>' with 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The code creates a list comprehension that iterates over the enumerated elements of `s1`. For each element where the character is '>', it calculates the index position (i) plus one and adds it to the list `pre`. The length of `s1` remains n, and its content (characters '<' and '>') does not change.
