Postcondition: `i` is `n - 2`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `totalOne` is the length of `pre`, `suffZero` is a list containing 0 and then the previous last element plus `i + 1`, `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros. If `len(suffZero) - 1` (denoted as `zr`) is less than or equal to `totalOne` (`ol`), the `i`-th element of `ans` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`, where `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]` and `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, len(suffZero) - 1)`. Otherwise, the `i`-th element of `ans` is `zeroInd - oneInd`, where `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`.
