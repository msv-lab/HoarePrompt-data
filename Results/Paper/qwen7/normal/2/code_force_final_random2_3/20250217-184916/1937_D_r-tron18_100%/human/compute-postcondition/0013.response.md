Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `totalOne` is the length of `pre`, `suffZero` is a list containing 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `el` is the value of `s1[i]` and is '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is calculated as 2 times the result of `func_1(suffZero, ol)` and the condition `ol <= zr` is true; `oneInd` is calculated as 2 times the last element of `preOne` minus the result of `func_1(preOne, 1)`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans[i]` to `zeroInd - oneInd`. The values of `i`, `preOne`, `totalOne`, `suffZero`, `ans`, `el`, `ol`, `zr`, `zeroInd`, and `oneInd` are all derived from the initial state, and no new values are introduced. The only change is the calculation of `ans[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
