Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `totalOne` is the length of `pre`, `suffZero` is a list containing 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    el = s1[i]
    if el == '>':
        ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
        if ol <= zr:
            zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
            oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
        else:
            zeroInd = 2 * suffZero[-1]
            oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)
            oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)
            fi = func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi
        preOne.pop()
        totalOne -= 1
    else:
        suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)
        ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
        if zr <= ol:
            zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]
            oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1
        else:
            zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
            oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1]
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `n - 2`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `totalOne` is the length of `pre`, `suffZero` is a list containing 0 and possibly additional elements based on the value of `el`, and `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros. If `el` is '>', `i` becomes `n - 3`, `totalOne` decreases by 1, and `preOne` starts from 1. If `el` is not '>', `suffZero` is updated by appending the previous last element plus `i + 1`, and the `i`-th element of `ans` is determined based on the relationship between `zeroInd` and `oneInd`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is either `n - 4` or `n - 3`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `totalOne` is the length of `pre`, `suffZero` is a list containing 0 and possibly additional elements based on the value of `el`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `ol` is `totalOne`, and `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`. If `el` is `'>', i` is `n - 4`, `totalOne` is `totalOne - 1`, and `suffZero` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `i` is `n - 3`, `suffZero` contains `0` and `n - 1`, and `ans[i]` is either `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1` if `n - 1` is less than or equal to `totalOne`, or `zeroInd - oneInd` otherwise.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is either `n - 5` or `n - 4`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums, `totalOne` is `ol`, `suffZero` is a list containing 0 and possibly additional elements based on `el`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, and `ans[i]` is updated as follows:




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
