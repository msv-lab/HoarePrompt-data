Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `totalOne` is the length of `pre`, `suffZero` is a list containing 0 and possibly additional elements based on the value of `el`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]`, `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans[i]` based on the given formula. Since the exact values of `oneInd`, `func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`, and `func_1(preOne, zr)` are not specified, they are represented as `oneInd`, `func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`, and `func_1(preOne, zr)` respectively. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
