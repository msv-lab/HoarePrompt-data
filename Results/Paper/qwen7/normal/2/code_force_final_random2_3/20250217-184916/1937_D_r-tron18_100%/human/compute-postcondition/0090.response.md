Postcondition: **`i` is either `n - 5` or `n - 4`, `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums, `totalOne` is `ol`, `suffZero` is a list containing 0 and possibly additional elements based on `el`, `el` is `s1[i]`, `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, and `ans[i]` is updated as follows:**

- If `el == '>'` and `ol <= zr`, then `ans[i]` is set to `zeroInd - oneInd`, where `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)` and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`.
- If `el == '>'` and `ol > zr`, then `ans[i]` is set to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`, where `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]` and `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`.
- If `el != '>'` and `zr <= ol`, then `ans[i]` is set to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`, where `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]` and `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`.
- If `el != '>'` and `zr > ol`, then `ans[i]` is set to `zeroInd - oneInd`, where `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)` and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`.
