Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0, `totalOne` is the length of `pre`, `suffZero` is a list containing 0, `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `el` is '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `oneInd` is the sum of `func_1(preOne, zr)` and `func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`, `ol` is greater than `zr`, `zeroInd` is 0**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `oneInd` to be the sum of the results of two function calls, `func_1(preOne, zr)` and `func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
