Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning it has run `n-1` times. After these iterations, `i` is `0`. For each pair of integers `(a, b)` read from standard input, `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` now contain both `b` and `a`, respectively. All adjacency list entries are bidirectional, indicating a fully constructed undirected graph with `n` nodes; `L` is set to `1`; `R` is set to `100001`; `numCuts` is `0`.
Code of the loop:
while R - L > 1:
    x = (L + R) // 2
    numCuts = 0
    leftover = dfs(1, 1)
    if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
        L = x
    else:
        R = x


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `x` is 50001, `adj` is a bidirectional adjacency list with `n` nodes, `L` is either 50001 or 1, `R` is either 100001 or 50001, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of dfs(1, 1).
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `L` is the left boundary, `R` is the right boundary, `x` is the integer division of `(L + R)` by 2, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), then `L` remains the same and `R` is the right boundary. Otherwise, `L` is the left boundary and `R` is updated to the integer division of `(L + R)` by 2.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the return value of dfs(1, 1). If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), then `L` is `x`. Otherwise, `R` is `x` and `leftover` remains the return value of dfs(1, 1).


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
