Output State: **`a` is the second integer entered, `b` is the first integer entered, `z` is `t`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `k` is an integer, `adj` is a list of lists with length `n + 1` where each element is an empty list, `adj[a]` now contains the value `[b]`, `adj[b]` now contains the value `[a]`**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. Since the input is read as integers, the values of `a` and `b` are updated to the newly entered integers. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
