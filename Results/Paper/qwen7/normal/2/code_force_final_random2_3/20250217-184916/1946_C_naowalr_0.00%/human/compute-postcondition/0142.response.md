Output State: `L` is 50001, `R` is 50001, `x` is 50001, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is `dfs(1, 1)`.

Explanation: After the loop executes, the value of `L` and `R` converge to the same value, which is the midpoint calculated in the last iteration. Since the condition `R - L > 1` is no longer satisfied, the loop terminates. The value of `x` becomes the final midpoint, and both `L` and `R` are set to this value. The values of `numCuts` and `leftover` remain as they were in the last iteration of the loop.
