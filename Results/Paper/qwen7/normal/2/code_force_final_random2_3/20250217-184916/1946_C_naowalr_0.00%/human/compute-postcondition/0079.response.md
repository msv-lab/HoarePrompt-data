Postcondition: `i` is 0, `x` is 50001, `adj` is a bidirectional adjacency list with `n` nodes, `L` is either 50001 or 1, `R` is either 100001 or 50001, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of dfs(1, 1). If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), then `L` is set to 50001. Otherwise, `L` is set to 1.
