Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `L` is less than `x - 1`, `R` is `x`, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, and `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`**

Explanation: The code assigns the result of `dfs(1, 1)` to the variable `leftover`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the values of `numCuts`, `L`, `R`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
