Output State: **`a` is the first integer entered, `b` is the second integer entered, `z` is `t`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer, `adj` is a list of lists with length `n + 1` where each element is an empty list, `adj[a]` now contains the value `[b]`, `adj[b]` now contains the value `[a]**.

Explanation: The code `adj[b].append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Initially, `adj[a]` contains `[b]`. After executing the code, `adj[b]` will also contain `[a]` because we are appending `a` to the list at index `b` in the `adj` list. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
