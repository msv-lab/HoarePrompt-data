Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is the integer value of the first input, `b` is the integer value of the second input, `adj[b]` now contains the value `[b, a]`**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the standard input using `sys.stdin.readline().split()` and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. These integers are then assigned to `a` and `b`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, and `adj[b]` is updated to contain the list `[b, a]`.
