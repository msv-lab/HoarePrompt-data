Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `L` is `x`, `R` is `x`, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, and `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`**.

Explanation: The line `L = x` updates the value of `L` to be equal to `x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `numCuts` remains 0, `L` is now `x`, `R` is still `x`, `x` is calculated as `(L + R) // 2`, and `leftover` retains its initial value as the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.
