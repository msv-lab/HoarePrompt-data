Output State: **`a` is the second integer entered, `b` is the first integer entered, `z` is `t`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `k` is an integer, `adj` is a list of lists with length `n + 1` where each element is an empty list, `adj[b]` now contains the value `[a, a, b]`**

Explanation: The code `adj[b].append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Initially, `adj[b]` contains `[a, a]`. After appending `a`, `adj[b]` becomes `[a, a, b]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
