Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `L` is less than `x - 1`, `R` is `x`, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, and `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`**

Explanation: The code `R = x` simply assigns the current value of `x` to `R`. Since `x` is already defined as `(L + R) // 2`, this assignment does not change the value of `R`. All other variables (`numCuts`, `L`, `R`, `x`, and `leftover`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
