Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is the integer value of the first input, `b` is the integer value of the second input, `adj[a]` now contains the value `[b, a]`**

Explanation: The code `adj[a].append(b)` appends the value `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Initially, `adj[b]` contains the value `[b, a]`, which means that `a` was already in the list `adj[b]`. Now, `b` is appended to the list `adj[a]`. The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and the structure of `adj[b]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes that `adj[a]` now contains the value `[b, a]`.
