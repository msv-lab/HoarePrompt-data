Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` is 50001, `adj` is a bidirectional adjacency list with `n` nodes, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0**.

The code simply reassigns `numCuts` to 0, which does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `i`, `x`, `adj`, `L`, and `R` remain unchanged.
