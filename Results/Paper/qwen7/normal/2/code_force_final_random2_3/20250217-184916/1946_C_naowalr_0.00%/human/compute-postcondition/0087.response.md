Postcondition: **`L` is the left boundary, `R` is the right boundary, `x` is the integer division of `(L + R)` by 2, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), then `L` remains the same and `R` is the right boundary. Otherwise, `L` is the left boundary and `R` is updated to the integer division of `(L + R)` by 2.**
