Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `L` is 50001, `R` is 50001, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `z` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `adj` is a list of lists with length `n + 1` where each element is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code creates an adjacency list representation of a graph with `n + 1` nodes (since the range starts from 0 to `n`). Each node initially has an empty list as its adjacency list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
