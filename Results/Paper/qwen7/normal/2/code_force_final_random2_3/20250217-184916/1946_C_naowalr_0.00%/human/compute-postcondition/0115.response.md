Output State: **`L` is 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `z` remains `t`, `n` is the total number of unique integers entered (plus one), `k` is an integer, `adj` is a list of lists with length `n + 1` where each element is an empty list except for the entries that contain the connections between the nodes as specified by the input, `R` is 100001.**

Explanation: The code `R = int(100000.0 + 1)` assigns the value `100001` to the variable `R`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
