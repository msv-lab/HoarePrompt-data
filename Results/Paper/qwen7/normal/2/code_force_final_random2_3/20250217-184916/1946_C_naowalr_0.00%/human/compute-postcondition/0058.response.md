Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the second number input from stdin, `b` is an integer equal to the first number input from stdin, `i` is `n-1`, and `n` is the same as before**.

Explanation: The code `a, b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))` reads two integers from standard input and splits them into a list. The first integer is assigned to `b`, and the second integer is assigned to `a`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
