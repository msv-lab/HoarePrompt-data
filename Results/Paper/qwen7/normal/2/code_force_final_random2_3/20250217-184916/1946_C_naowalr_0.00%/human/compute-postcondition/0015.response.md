Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is the integer value of the first input, `b` is the integer value of the second input, `adj[a]` now contains the value `[b, a]`, `adj[b]` now contains the value `[a, b]`**

Explanation: The code appends `a` to `adj[b]`. Initially, `adj[a]` contains `[b, a]`. After executing `adj[b].append(a)`, `adj[b]` will contain `[a, b, a]`, but since lists in Python do not allow duplicate entries, it will effectively contain `[a, b]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
