Postcondition: `numCuts` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is `n-1`, `a` and `b` are integers from inputs, `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` contain each other, forming an undirected graph, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `x` is the integer value of `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of dfs(1, 1), `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` and `leftover` is less than `x`.
