Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the second number input from stdin, `b` is an integer equal to the first number input from stdin, `i` is `n-1`, and `adj[b]` now includes `a`.**

Explanation: The code appends `a` to the list `adj[b]`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that `a` is added to the list stored in `adj[b]`.
