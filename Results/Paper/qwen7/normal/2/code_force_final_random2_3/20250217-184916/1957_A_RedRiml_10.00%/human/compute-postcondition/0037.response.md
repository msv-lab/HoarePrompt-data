Output State: **`shapes` is 0, `palka` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary containing each unique element from `palka` as keys with their respective counts as values, and `pl` is a list of all unique elements from `palka` in the order they were first encountered.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `shapes` to 0. It does not affect the values of `palka`, `d`, or `pl`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions where `palka` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary with counts of unique elements from `palka`, and `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` in the order they were first encountered.
