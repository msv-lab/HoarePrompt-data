Output State: **`palka` is not empty, `i` is the next element of `palka`, and `d[i]` is 2**

Explanation: The initial state shows that `palka` is not empty, `i` is the next element of `palka`, and `d[i]` is set to 1. The code snippet increments the value of `d[i]` by 1. Since `d[i]` was initially 1, after executing `d[i] += 1`, the value of `d[i]` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
