Output State: **`palka` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is now the last element of `pl`, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is either set to 1 or incremented by 1 depending on whether `d.get(i)` was `None` or not, and `pl` has `i` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `pl.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `pl`. Since `i` was the first element of `palka` in the initial state, after appending, `i` becomes the last element of `pl`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
