You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        pl = []
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        shapes = 0
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += 1
        print(shapes)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It counts the number of unique integers that appear 3 or more times across all test cases and prints this count for each test case. The function does not return any value but prints the count of such unique integers for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `w` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `ln` representing the number of sticks and then reads a list of stick lengths `palka`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - It uses a dictionary `d` to count the occurrences of each stick length.
   - It also creates a list `pl` containing unique stick lengths.

3. **Calculating the Number of Polygons:**
   - The program iterates over the unique stick lengths in `pl`.
   - For each unique stick length `j`, it checks if the count of that length in the dictionary `d` is at least 3.
   - If so, it increments the counter `shapes` by 1.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the value of `shapes` for each test case.

### Correctness Check

To verify the correctness, let's consider the example provided:

#### Example Test Cases

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input:
     ```
     1
     1
     1
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     0
     ```

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input:
     ```
     1
     2
     1 1
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     0
     ```

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input:
     ```
     1
     6
     2 2 3 3 3 3
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     1
     ```

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input:
     ```
     1
     9
     4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     2
     ```

#### Analysis of the Program

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - There is only one stick of length 1. Since no stick can form a polygon with fewer than 3 sides, the output is `0`.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - There are two sticks of length 1. Again, no polygon can be formed, so the output is `0`.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - There are six sticks: three of length 2 and three of length 3. We can form one square using the three sticks of length 3. Therefore, the output is `1`.

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - There are nine sticks: four of length 4 and five of length 2. We can form one pentagon with side length 2 and one square with side length 4. Therefore, the output is `2`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly counts the number of unique stick lengths and determines if there are enough sticks of each length to form polygons. It correctly handles the constraints and examples provided.
