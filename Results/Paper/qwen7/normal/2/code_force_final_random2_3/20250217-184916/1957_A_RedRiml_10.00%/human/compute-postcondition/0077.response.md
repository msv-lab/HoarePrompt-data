Output State: **`palka` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is the last element of `palka`, `pl` is a list containing the last element of `palka`, and `d[i]` is incremented by 1 if it was not None, otherwise it is set to 1.**

Explanation: The code appends the last element of the list `palka` to the list `pl`. The initial conditions of `palka` and `i` remain unchanged. Additionally, if `d[i]` was not `None`, it is incremented by 1; otherwise, it is set to 1.
