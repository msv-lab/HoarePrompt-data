Output State: **`pl` contains `i`, `palka` is not empty, `d.get(i)` is set to 1 if it was None, otherwise `d.get(i)` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `pl.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `pl`. The conditions for `d.get(i)` (it being set to 1 if it was None, or incremented by 1 otherwise) and `palka` (not being empty) remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, these conditions are still valid, and the only new information is that `i` has been added to `pl`.
