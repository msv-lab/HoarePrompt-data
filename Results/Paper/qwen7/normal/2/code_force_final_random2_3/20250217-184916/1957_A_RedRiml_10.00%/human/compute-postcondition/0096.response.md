Output State: **`shapes` is `shapes + 1`. `pl` must still contain at least one element. The new value of `d[j]` must be greater than or equal to 3.**

Explanation: The code `shapes += 1` increments the value of `shapes` by 1. The other conditions and constraints remain unchanged. Therefore, `pl` must still contain at least one element, `j` will be the next element in `pl`, and the new value of `d[j]` must be greater than or equal to 3.
