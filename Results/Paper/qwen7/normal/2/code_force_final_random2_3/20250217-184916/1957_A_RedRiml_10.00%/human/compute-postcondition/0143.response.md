Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the iterable `pl`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `j`: This variable will take on values from the iterable `pl` during each iteration.
   - `pl`: This is a list that contains elements from `palka` that were not already in `pl` during the loop's execution.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `pl` must contain at least one element. If `pl` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states based on the loop head**:
   - Since the loop depends on `pl` having at least one element, we need to ensure that `pl` is not empty.
   - The other variables (`shapes`, `d`, `w`, `ln`, and `palka`) are not directly involved in the loop head and their current states do not affect whether the loop will execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `pl` must contain at least one element.

**State:**
**`pl` must contain at least one element**
