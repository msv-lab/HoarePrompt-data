Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in palka:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `palka`.

2. **Understand the postcondition at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `palka` is a list of integers with at least 1 element.
   - `i` is now the last element of `palka`.
   - `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is either set to 1 or incremented by 1 depending on whether `d.get(i)` was `None` or not.
   - `palka` has `i` appended to it.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `palka` must still contain elements. Since `i` is the last element of `palka` at the end of the previous iteration, and `palka` has `i` appended to it, `palka` will have at least two elements (the original element plus the newly appended `i`).
   - Therefore, `i` will be the last element of `palka` again in the next iteration.
   - `d` will be updated as per the rules mentioned, but since the loop body is omitted, we don't need to specify the exact value of `d[i]` unless there is additional information.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `palka` still contains at least one element, and `i` is the last element of `palka`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`palka` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is the last element of `palka`**
