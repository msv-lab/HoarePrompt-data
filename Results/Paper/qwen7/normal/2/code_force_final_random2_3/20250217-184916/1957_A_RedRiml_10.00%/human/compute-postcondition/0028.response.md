Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `palka`.

2. **Understand the Loop Behavior**:
   - `i` is the current element being processed from the list `palka`.
   - The loop iterates over each element in `palka`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `palka` contains all elements except the first one.
   - `i` is the next element in `palka`.
   - `d[i]` is set to 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or incremented by 1 if `i` was already in `d`.
   - If `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` now contains the element `i`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is the next element in `palka`, the next element in `palka` will be the one following `i`.
   - `d[i]` will be updated based on its current value (either 1 or incremented by 1).
   - If `i` is not in `pl`, `pl` will contain `i`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `palka` will lose its first element, as it contains all elements except the first one.
   - `i` will be the next element in `palka`.
   - `d[i]` will be updated based on its current value.
   - If `i` is not in `pl`, `pl` will contain `i`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `palka` will now contain all elements except the first two.
- `i` will be the next element in `palka`.
- `d[i]` will be updated based on its current value.
- If `i` is not in `pl`, `pl` will contain `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`palka` contains all elements except the first two, `i` is the next element in `palka`, `d[i]` is set to 1 if `i` was not previously in `d`, or incremented by 1 if `i` was already in `d`, and if `i` is not in `pl`, then `pl` now contains the element `i`.**
