Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if `s` contains exactly one '1', otherwise `a` is 0, `b` is 'SQUARE', `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 2, `s` is a string input from the user, `s` is updated with the new input string.**

Explanation: The code sets `b` to 'SQUARE'. This changes the value of `b` but does not affect any other variables. The initial conditions for `t`, `i`, `a`, `n`, `j`, and `s` remain unchanged.
