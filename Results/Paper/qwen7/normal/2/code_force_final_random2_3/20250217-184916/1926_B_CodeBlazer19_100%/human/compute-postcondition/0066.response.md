Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `j` as the variable being iterated over using `range(n)`. Therefore, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `j`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `j`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is equal to `n`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `j < n`. Since `j` starts at `n` and is incremented within the loop, it will decrement from `n` to `0` during each iteration.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decremented by 1 from its current value of `n` to `n-1`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `j` has been decremented by 1.

**State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0, `b` is 'SQUARE', `n` is an input integer, `j` is `n-1`, `s` is the last input string provided, and `s` is updated to the new input string. If the string `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE'.**
