Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `j` is initialized to `n-1` (as given in the state).
   - `n` is an input integer (also given in the state).

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. 

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `j` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `j` is initially set to `n-1`, the loop will execute if `n-1 < n`, which is always true.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs adjustment is ensuring that the loop can start, which means `j` should be less than `n`.

**Final State**:
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, `a` is 0, `b` is '', `n` is an input integer, `j` is `n-1`, and `s` holds the last input string provided, `j` must be less than `n`**
