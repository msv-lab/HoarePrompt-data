Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `a` is 0, `b` is 'SQUARE', `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, the current value of `s` has more than one occurrence of the character '1'**.

Explanation: The code `b = 'SQUARE'` assigns the string 'SQUARE' to the variable `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
