Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `j < n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 100.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0.
   - `b` is either an empty string or 'SQUARE'.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `j` is 0.
   - The current value of `s` has either exactly one occurrence of the character '1' (in which case `a` is 'TRIANGLE') or more than one or no such occurrence (in which case `a` is 0 and `b` is either 'SQUARE' or an empty string).

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is currently 0 and `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute again if `j` is incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` will become 1.
   - The values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0, `b` is either an empty string or 'SQUARE', `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, and the current value of `s` has either exactly one occurrence of the character '1' (in which case `a` is 'TRIANGLE') or more than one or no such occurrence (in which case `a` is 0 and `b` is either 'SQUARE' or an empty string)**.
