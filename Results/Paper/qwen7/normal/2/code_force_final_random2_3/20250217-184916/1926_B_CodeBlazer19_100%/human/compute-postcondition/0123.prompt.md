Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and it is now set to the integer input received; n is undefined.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = 0
    b = ''
    for j in range(n):
        s = input()
        if s.count('1') == 1:
            a = 'TRIANGLE'
        elif s.count('1') > 1:
            b = 'SQUARE'
    if a != 0:
        print(a)
    else:
        print(b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if any of the strings `s` entered during the loop iterations contained exactly one '1', otherwise `a` is 0, `b` is 'SQUARE' if any of the strings `s` entered during the loop iterations contained more than one '1', otherwise `b` remains an empty string, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is equal to `n-1`, and `s` holds the last input string provided.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0, `b` is 'SQUARE', `n` is an input integer, `j` is `n-1`, `s` is the final input string provided, and if `a` is not 0, the program does not change any variables. If `a` is 0, the program does not change any variables either.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 2, `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE' if any input string contained exactly one '1', otherwise `a` remains 'TRIANGLE' or 0. `b` is 'SQUARE' if any input string contained more than one '1', otherwise `b` remains either an empty string, 'SQUARE', or 'TRIANGLE'. `n` is the total number of inputs provided by the user, `j` is 0, and `s` is the last input string provided by the user.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
