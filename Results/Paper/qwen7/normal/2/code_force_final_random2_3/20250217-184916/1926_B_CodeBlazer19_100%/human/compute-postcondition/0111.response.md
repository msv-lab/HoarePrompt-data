Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 2, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0, `b` is 'SQUARE', `n` must be at least 1, `j` is `n-1`, `s` is the input string provided by the user, and if the string `s` contains more than one '1', `t` remains unchanged; otherwise, `t` remains unchanged.
