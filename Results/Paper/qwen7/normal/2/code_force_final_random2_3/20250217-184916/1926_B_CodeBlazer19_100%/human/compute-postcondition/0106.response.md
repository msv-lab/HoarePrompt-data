Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 2, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0, `b` is either an empty string, 'SQUARE', or 'TRIANGLE', `n` must be at least 1, `j` is `n-2`, `s` is the input string provided by the user. If the string `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` becomes 'TRIANGLE'. Otherwise, `a` remains unchanged.**
