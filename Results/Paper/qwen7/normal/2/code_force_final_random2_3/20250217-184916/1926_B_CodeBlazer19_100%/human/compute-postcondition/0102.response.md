Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 2, `a` is 'TRIANGLE', `b` is either an empty string, 'SQUARE', or 'TRIANGLE', `n` must be at least 1, `j` is `n-2`, `s` is the input string provided by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a = 'TRIANGLE'` assigns the string `'TRIANGLE'` to the variable `a`. This updates the value of `a` while leaving the values of all other variables unchanged.
