Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- `i` is 0.
- `a` is 0.
- `b` is 'SQUARE' if any of the strings `s` entered during the loop iterations contained more than one '1', otherwise `b` remains an empty string.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `j` is equal to `n-1`.
- `s` holds the last input string provided.

The `print(b)` statement will print the value of `b`.

To determine the value of `b`, we need to consider the condition under which `b` is set to 'SQUARE'. According to the initial state, `b` is 'SQUARE' if any of the strings `s` entered during the loop iterations contained more than one '1'. Since the loop iterations and the strings `s` are not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, we cannot determine if `b` was set to 'SQUARE' or left as an empty string.

However, since the problem does not provide any specific strings `s` that were entered during the loop, and there is no indication that any such strings were entered, we assume that `b` remains an empty string.

Output: **''**
