Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 2, `a` is 0, `b` is 'SQUARE', `n` is an input integer, `j` is `n-1`, `s` is the final input string provided.**

Explanation: The variable `a` is reassigned to `0`. All other variables retain their initial states. The value of `n` is updated to the integer input provided by the user, and `j` is set to `n-1`. The initial values of `t`, `i`, `b`, `n`, `j`, and `s` remain unchanged except for `a` which is now explicitly set to `0`.
