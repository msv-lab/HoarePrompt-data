Let's break down the task step by step:

1. Identify the objects in the loop head: The loop head is `for i in range(t):`. The objects involved here are `i` and `t`.

2. Determine the initial state of these objects:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and is set to the integer input received.
   - `i` is not defined initially.

3. Understand the condition for the loop to execute: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is set to an integer input, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

4. Adjust the state accordingly: We need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 and that `i` starts from 0, as per the behavior of the `range()` function in Python.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `i` is 0**
