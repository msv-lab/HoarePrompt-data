Output State: **`a` must contain at least one element, `op` is the result of `op ^= val >> i & 1`, `cnt` is increased by 1 if `op` is false.**

Explanation: The code `op ^= val >> i & 1` modifies the value of `op`. Here, `val` is the next element in the list `a`, and `i` is an unspecified integer. The expression `val >> i & 1` extracts the `i`-th bit from `val`. The `^=` operator performs a bitwise XOR assignment operation on `op` with the result of `val >> i & 1`. The value of `cnt` is increased by 1 if `op` becomes false (i.e., `op` is 0) after the operation. The initial conditions of `a`, `op`, and `cnt` remain valid, but their specific values may change based on the operations performed.
