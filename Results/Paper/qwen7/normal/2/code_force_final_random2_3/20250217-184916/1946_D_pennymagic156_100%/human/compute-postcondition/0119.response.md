Output State: **`a` is not an empty iterable, `val` is the next value from `a`, `cnt` is increased by 1, `op` is the result of `op ^= val >> i & 1` operation.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `a` remains the same non-empty iterable, `val` remains the next value from `a`, and `op` remains the result of the bitwise operation `op ^= val >> i & 1`.
