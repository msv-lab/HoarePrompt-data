Postcondition: **`i` is 28, `u` is either 0 or 1, `v` is either even or the sum of [(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a] modulo 2 is not 0. If `u` is 0, `v` remains unchanged. If `u` is 1, `op` is the final result of the XOR operation over the 28th bit of each element in `a`, `cnt` is the total number of times `op` became `False` during the loop execution, and `ans` is the maximum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`.**
