Output State: **`a` contains at least one element, `op` is the result of `op ^= val >> i & 1`, where `val` is the next element in the list `a` and `i` is an unspecified integer.**

Explanation: The operation `op ^= val >> i & 1` modifies the value of `op`. Here, `val >> i & 1` extracts the `i`-th bit from `val` (right shift `val` by `i` positions and then perform a bitwise AND with 1). This bit is then XORed with `op`. The values of `a` and `val` remain unchanged, but `op` is updated according to the operation.
