Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list where each element has been XORed with the next `val`, and `val` is the next element from `a`; `ai` is updated to be the current `ai` XORed with the next `val`.**

Explanation: The code `ai ^= val` updates the value of `ai` by performing an XOR operation between the current value of `ai` and the next `val` in the list `a`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, and the condition that each element in the list `a` has been XORed with the next `val` from the list remains valid.
