Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `ai` is `ai` XOR (`val` right-shifted by `i` bits and then ANDed with 1), `val` is the next element in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `ai ^= val` performs a bitwise XOR operation between `ai` and `val`. The value of `val` is the next element in the list `a`. The variable `op` is not affected by this operation and remains as `op` XOR (`val` right-shifted by `i` bits and then ANDed with 1). The other variables remain unchanged.
