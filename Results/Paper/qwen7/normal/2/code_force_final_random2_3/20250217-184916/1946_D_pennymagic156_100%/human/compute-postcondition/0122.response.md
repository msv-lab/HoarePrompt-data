Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for val in a:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `val` and `a`.

2. **Understand the postconditions from the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is not an empty iterable.
   - `val` is the next value from `a`.
   - `cnt` is increased by 1.
   - `op` is the result of the operation `op ^= val >> i & 1`.

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `a` must still be a non-empty iterable.
   - `val` will be the next value from `a`.
   - `cnt` will be increased by 1.
   - `op` will be updated based on the new `val`.

Given these points, let's adjust the states for the next iteration:

- `a` remains a non-empty iterable.
- `val` becomes the next value from `a`.
- `cnt` is increased by 1.
- `op` is updated based on the new `val`.

Since the exact values of `val` and `op` are not specified, we only need to ensure that the conditions for the next iteration are met.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`a` is not an empty iterable, `val` is the next value from `a`, `cnt` is increased by 1, `op` is updated based on the new `val`**
