Output State: **`i` is 27, `u` is 0, `v` is even, `op` is 0, `ai` is 0**.

The code initializes two new variables, `op` and `ai`, both set to 0. Since `i`, `u`, and `v` were already defined in the initial state and their values did not change, they remain the same. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `op` and `ai`, along with the unchanged values of `i`, `u`, and `v`.
