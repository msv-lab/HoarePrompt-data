Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list with one less element, `val` is the third element of `a`, `op` is the result of `op` XOR the i-th bit of `val`, and `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the result of `op` is `False`.**

Explanation: The code `op ^= val >> i & 1` modifies the value of `op` by performing a bitwise XOR operation between `op` and the i-th bit of `val`. The i-th bit of `val` is obtained by shifting `val` right by `i` positions and then performing a bitwise AND with 1. The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the result of this XOR operation is `False` (which means 0 in binary). However, since the exact values of `op`, `val`, and `i` are not specified, we can only state that `op` is updated accordingly and `cnt` is incremented if the result is `False`.
