Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for val in a:`. This means the variables involved in the loop head are `val` and `a`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`. For each iteration, `val` takes the value of the current element in the list `a`.

3. **Determine the state changes**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition is given as follows:
   - `a` is a non-empty list.
   - `val` is the first element of `a`.
   - `op` is the result of `op` XOR the i-th bit of `val`.
   - If the result of `op` is `False`, the variable `cnt` is incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `val` is set to the first element of `a` at the start of the loop, after the first iteration, `val` will be the second element of `a`.
   - The list `a` remains the same unless modified within the loop body, but since no modifications are mentioned, `a` stays the same.
   - The variable `op` and `cnt` depend on the value of `val` and the operation performed, but these values are not directly relevant to adjusting the loop head state.

5. **Formulate the new state**: Based on the above points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the fact that `val` is now the second element of `a`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` is a non-empty list, `val` is the second element of `a`, `op` is the result of `op` XOR the i-th bit of `val`, and if the result of `op` is `False`, the variable `cnt` is incremented by 1.**
