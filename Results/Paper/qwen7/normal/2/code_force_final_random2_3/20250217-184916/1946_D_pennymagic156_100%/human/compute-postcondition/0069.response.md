Postcondition: `i` is 29, `u` is 0, and `v` is even. If `v` is odd, then `v` is set to 0. In the case where `v` is even, either `ans` is updated to the maximum value between the previous value of `ans` and `cnt`, or there is no change to `ans` and `cnt` due to breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.
