Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list, `val` is the first element of `a`, `op` is the result of `op` XOR the i-th bit of `val`.**

Explanation: The code `op ^= val >> i & 1` performs a bitwise operation. Here, `val >> i & 1` extracts the i-th bit of `val` (considering the rightmost bit as the 0th bit). The `^=` operator then performs a bitwise XOR between `op` and the extracted bit. Since `val` is the first element of the list `a`, and `i` is not specified, we keep it as a general index. The value of `op` is updated based on the i-th bit of `val`. All other variables remain unchanged.
