Output State: **`a` is not an empty iterable, `val` is the next value from `a`, `cnt` is increased by 1, `op` is updated based on the bitwise XOR of `op` and the i-th bit of `val`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `op` by performing a bitwise XOR operation between `op` and the i-th bit of `val`. The i-th bit of `val` is obtained by shifting `val` right by `i` positions and then performing a bitwise AND with 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
