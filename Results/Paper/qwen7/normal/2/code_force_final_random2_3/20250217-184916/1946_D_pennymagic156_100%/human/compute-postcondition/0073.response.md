Output State: **`i` is 28, `u` is `x` >> 28 & 1, `v` is the sum of [(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a]**.

Explanation: The code updates the values of `u` and `v`. `u` is assigned the value of `x` right-shifted by `i` (which is 28) and then bitwise ANDed with 1. This operation essentially extracts the least significant bit of `x`. `v` is assigned the sum of the results of right-shifting each element in list `a` by `i` (28) and then bitwise ANDing with 1, which extracts the least significant bit of each element in `a`. The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial state, and the value of `v` depends on the elements in list `a`.
