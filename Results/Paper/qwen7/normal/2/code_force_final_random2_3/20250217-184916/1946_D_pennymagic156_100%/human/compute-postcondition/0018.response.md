Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers where each element has been modified by `val`, `op` is the result of `op ^= val >> i & 1`, and `t` is a list containing the last element of `a`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `t.append(ai)` appends the last element of the list `a` (denoted as `ai`) to the list `t`. The initial state of `op` is given as 0, and it is calculated using the expression `op ^= val >> i & 1`, but since no specific values for `val` and `i` are provided, `op` remains unchanged at 0. All other variables and their conditions remain the same as the initial state.
