Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list where each element is updated by performing XOR operation with `val`, `op` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `ai ^= val` updates the element `ai` in the list `a` by performing the XOR operation between `ai` and `val`. The variable `op` is not affected by this operation and retains its original value. The initial state of `a` being a non-empty list remains unchanged, but each element in the list is now updated according to the XOR operation with `val`.
