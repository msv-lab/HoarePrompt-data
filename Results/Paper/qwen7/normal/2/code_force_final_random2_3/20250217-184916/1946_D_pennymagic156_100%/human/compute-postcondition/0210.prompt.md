You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: (n, x) is a tuple of two integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ x < 2^30; a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30 for all i from 1 to n.
def func_5():
    n, x = func_3()
    a = func_1()
    t, ans = [], -1
    for i in range(29, -1, -1):
        u, v = x >> i & 1, sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])
        
        if u == v == 0:
            continue
        
        if u == 0:
            if v % 2:
                return ans
            else:
                op = ai = 0
                for val in a:
                    op ^= val >> i & 1
                    ai ^= val
                    if not op:
                        t.append(ai)
                        ai = 0
                a, t = t, []
        elif v % 2:
            continue
        elif v:
            op = cnt = 0
            for val in a:
                op ^= val >> i & 1
                if not op:
                    cnt += 1
            ans = max(ans, cnt)
        else:
            break
        
    #State: i is 0, u is 0, and v is even.
    return max(ans, len(a))
    #The program returns the maximum value between ans (which is not defined in the given state) and the length of list a (which is not defined in the given state)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It returns either a value stored in 'ans', the integer 28, the value of 'ans' (which is not defined), or the maximum value between 'ans' (not defined) and the length of list 'a' (not defined).

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns a value stored in 'ans', but since 'ans' is not defined in the given code snippet, no specific value can be determined.

Case_2: The program returns 28

Case_3: The program returns ans which is not specified in the given information.

Case_4: The program returns the maximum value between ans (which is not defined in the given state) and the length of list a (which is not defined in the given state)


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
