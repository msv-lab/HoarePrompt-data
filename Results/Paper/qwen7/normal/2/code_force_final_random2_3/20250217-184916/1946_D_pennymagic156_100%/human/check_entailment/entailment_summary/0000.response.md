Reasoning:
- The problem requires processing multiple test cases, each consisting of an array `a` and a number `x`. The goal is to find the maximum number `k` of non-overlapping subarrays such that the bitwise OR of their bitwise XORs is less than or equal to `x`.
- The given solution uses a function `func_5()` that correctly handles the logic described in the problem statement. It processes the input, splits it into `n` and `x`, and then processes the array `a`.
- The function `func_5()` iterates over bits from the most significant to the least significant (29 to 0). For each bit position, it checks the bit value of `x` and the sum of corresponding bits in the array `a`. Based on the conditions, it updates the counter `ans` or returns early.
- The function correctly handles the edge cases and ensures that the maximum number `k` is calculated accurately.
- The execution summaries of the functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5`) match the expected behavior and provide the necessary inputs and outputs as required by the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
