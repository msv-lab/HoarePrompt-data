Postcondition: `y` is `n`, `b` is the maximum value among `l[x]` and the maximum value in the list `l` from index 1 to `n-1`, `x` is `n + 2`. If `l[x] - a` is greater than or equal to `l[x] - b`, then `b` remains the maximum value in the list `l` from index 1 to `n-1`. Otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]`.
