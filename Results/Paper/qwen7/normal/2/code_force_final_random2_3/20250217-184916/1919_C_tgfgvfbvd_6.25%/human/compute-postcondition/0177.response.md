Postcondition: `y` is 3, `n` is greater than 4, `x` is `n + 1`. If `a` is greater than or equal to the element at index `x` in list `l`, then no change is made to `a` and `b` remains as the element at index `x` in list `l`. Otherwise, `a` remains as the element at index `x` in list `l` and `b` remains as the element at index `x` in list `l`.
