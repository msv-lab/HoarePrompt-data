Postcondition: `y` is `n - 1`, and `b` is the maximum value in the list `l` from index 1 to `n-1`. If for all `x` in the range from `y + 1` to `n - 1`, the condition `(a - l[x] <= b - l[x])` is true, then `b` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `b` is updated to the value of `l[x]` where the condition is false for the first such `x`. If `a >= l[x]` is true for at least one `x` in the range from `y + 1` to `n - 1`, then `a` is assigned the value of `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` remains as the maximum value in the list `l` from index 1 to `n-1`.
