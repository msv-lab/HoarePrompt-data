Output State: **`y` is 3, `n` is greater than 4, `x` is `n`, `b` is `l[x]`**

Explanation: The code `b = l[x]` assigns the value at index `x` of list `l` to variable `b`. Since `x` is equal to `n`, `b` is set to the value at index `n` of list `l`. The values of `y` and `n` remain unchanged, and `x` is still equal to `n`.
