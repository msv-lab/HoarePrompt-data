Postcondition: **`y` is `n - 1`, `b` is the maximum value in the list `l` from index 1 to `n-1`, and `b` is assigned the first element of the list `l` if no element in the list from index 1 to `n-1` is greater than the first element. The current value of `x` is `n`, and the current value of `a` is such that the if condition `l[x] > a and l[x] > b` is evaluated.**
