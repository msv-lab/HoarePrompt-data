Output State: **`y` is `n`, `b` is `l[x]`, `x` is `n + 2`**

Explanation: The code `b = l[x]` assigns the value at index `x` of list `l` to variable `b`. Initially, `b` was the maximum value in the list `l` from index 1 to `n-1`. After executing the code, `b` now holds the value at index `x` of list `l`. The value of `x` remains `n + 2` as it is not affected by the code. The value of `y` remains `n` as it is not affected by the code.
