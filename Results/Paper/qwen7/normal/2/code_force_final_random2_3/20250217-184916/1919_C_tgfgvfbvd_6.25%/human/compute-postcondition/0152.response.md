Output State: **`c` is 1, `y` is 3, `n` is greater than 4, `x` is `n`.**

Explanation: The variable `c` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (which could be 0 or any other number), resulting in `c` being 1. The values of `y`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
