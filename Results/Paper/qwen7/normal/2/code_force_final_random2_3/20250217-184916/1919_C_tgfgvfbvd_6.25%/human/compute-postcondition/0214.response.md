Output State: **`x` is an index in list `l`; `b` is equal to the value at index `x` in list `l`, which is less than or equal to both `a` and `b`.**

This means that the value of `b` has been updated to the value at index `x` in list `l`, and `x` remains an index in list `l` with the same properties as before (the value at this index is less than or equal to both `a` and `b`).
