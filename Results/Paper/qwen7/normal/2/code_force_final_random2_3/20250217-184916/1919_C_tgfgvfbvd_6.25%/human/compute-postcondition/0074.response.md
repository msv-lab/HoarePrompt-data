Postcondition: `y` is `n`, and `b` is the maximum value in the list `l` from index 1 to `n-1`. Specifically, if `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `c` is increased by 1, and `b` is updated to the maximum value between `l[x]` and the current `b`. Otherwise, if `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, `b` remains the maximum value in the list unless `l[x]` is greater than or equal to `b`, in which case `b` is updated to `l[x]`. If neither of these conditions is met, `b` remains unchanged.
