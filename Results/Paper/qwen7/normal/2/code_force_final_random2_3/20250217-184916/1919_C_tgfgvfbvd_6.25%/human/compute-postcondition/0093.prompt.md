Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Postcondition: `y` is equal to `n-1`, `b` is the maximum value in the list `l` from index 1 to `n-1`, and `b` is assigned from the first element in the list `l` if no element in the list from index 1 to `n-1` is greater than the first element.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(y + 1, n):
    if l[x] > a and l[x] > b:
        if l[x] - a >= l[x] - b:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
        c += 1
    elif l[x] < a and l[x] < b:
        if a - l[x] <= b - l[x]:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
    elif a >= l[x]:
        a = l[x]
    else:
        b = l[x]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `y` is `n - 1`, `b` is the maximum value in the list `l` from index 1 to `n-1`. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `c` is increased by 1, and `a` is set to `l[x]` if `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b` is true, otherwise `b` is updated to `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is updated to the value of `l[x]` where the condition `(a - l[x] <= b - l[x])` is false for the first such `x`, and `a` is assigned the value of `l[x]` if `a >= l[x]` is true for at least one `x` in the range from `y + 1` to `n - 1`. If no such `x` exists, `b` remains as the maximum value in the list `l` from index 1 to `n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `y` is `n`, and `b` is the maximum value in the list `l` from index 1 to `n-1`. Specifically, if `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `c` is increased by 1, and `b` is updated to the maximum value between `l[x]` and the current `b`. Otherwise, if `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, `b` remains the maximum value in the list unless `l[x]` is greater than or equal to `b`, in which case `b` is updated to `l[x]`. If neither of these conditions is met, `b` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `y` is `n`, `b` is the maximum value between `l[x]` and the maximum value in the list `l` from index 1 to `n-1`, and `x` is `n + 2`. If `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`, then `b` remains the maximum value in the list `l` from index 1 to `n-1`. Otherwise, `b` is updated to `l[x]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
