Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `results` is a list containing 'no', `i` is 0, `n` is an odd integer, `arr` is the string input by the user, and the count of 'U' in `arr` is less than or equal to the count of 'D' in `arr`.**

The code snippet appends the string `'no'` to the list `results`. This changes the state of `results` from being an empty list to a list containing `'no'`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state descriptions.
