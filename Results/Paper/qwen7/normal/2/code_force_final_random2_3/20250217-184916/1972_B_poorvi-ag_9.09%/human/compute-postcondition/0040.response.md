Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is iterating over the `results` list.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list. The elements in the `results` list are either 'yes' or 'no'.

3. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**: Since the loop is iterating over the `results` list, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the state of the `results` list itself. Specifically, we need to ensure that the `results` list contains the correct elements for the loop to execute properly.

Given the postconditions:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- `results` is a list containing 'yes' and 'no' for each iteration of the loop.
- `i` is initialized to `t`.
- `n` is the integer input by the user for each iteration.
- `arr` is the string input by the user for each iteration.

For the loop to execute correctly, the `results` list must contain the correct values ('yes' or 'no') based on the conditions specified in the problem statement.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the `results` list.

**State:**
**`results` is a list containing 'yes' and 'no' for each iteration of the loop.**

This ensures that the loop can iterate over the `results` list as expected.
