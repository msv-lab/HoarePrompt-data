Output State: **Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `results` is a list containing 'yes' and 'no' for each iteration of the loop, `i` is `t`, `n` is the integer input by the user for each iteration, and `arr` is the string input by the user for each iteration. If `n` is even, 'no' is appended to the `results` list. Otherwise, if the count of 'U' in `arr` is greater than the count of 'D', 'yes' is appended; otherwise, 'no' is appended.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `results` list will contain the outcome ('yes' or 'no') for each of the `t` inputs processed by the loop. The value of `i` will be equal to `t` since it increments with each iteration, and `n` and `arr` will hold the last input values from the user for the final iteration of the loop.
