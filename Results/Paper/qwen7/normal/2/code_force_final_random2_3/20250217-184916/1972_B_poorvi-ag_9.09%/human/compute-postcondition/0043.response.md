Based on the initial state provided, `i` is the next element in the `results` list. Since `results` is the same list and `i` is the next element, it means `i` is the element that comes after the current last element in the `results` list if it were to be iterated over.

However, without knowing the exact content of the `results` list, we can only describe `i` as the next element in the list.

Output: **the next element in the `results` list**
