Output State: **All elements in the `results` list are either 'yes' or 'no'. The loop has executed as many times as there are elements in the `results` list.**

Explanation: Given the loop iterates over each element in the `results` list and prints it, once the loop completes all its iterations, the `results` list will contain all the outcomes ('yes' or 'no') determined by the conditions specified. Since the loop processes each element in the `results` list exactly once, the final state of `results` will be fully populated with the outcomes from all iterations, and `i` will be set to the last element in the `results` list after the loop finishes.
