Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' based on whether the count of 'U' in `arr` is greater than the count of 'D' in `arr`, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, and `arr` is the string input by the user. If `n` is even, `results` contains 'no'. Otherwise, `results` contains 'yes' or 'no' based on the count comparison.
