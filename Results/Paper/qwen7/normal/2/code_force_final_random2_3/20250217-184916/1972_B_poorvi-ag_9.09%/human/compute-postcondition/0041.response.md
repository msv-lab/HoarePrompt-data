To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the given initial state:

- The code snippet only contains a single line: `print(i)`.
- There is no explicit definition or initialization of the variable `i` provided in the initial state.

Given this information, we need to consider the context and typical scenarios where such a line might appear. Since there is no explicit value or initialization provided for `i`, we must assume that `i` is a variable that has been defined and assigned a value elsewhere in the code prior to this print statement.

However, since the problem does not provide any additional context or information about the value of `i`, we cannot determine a specific value for `i`. Therefore, the output will simply be the value of `i` as it is currently defined in the program.

Output: **i**
