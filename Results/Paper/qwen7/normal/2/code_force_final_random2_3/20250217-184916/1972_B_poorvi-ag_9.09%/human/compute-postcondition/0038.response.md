Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `results` is a list containing 'yes' and 'no', `i` is `t + 1`, `n` is the integer input by the user, `arr` is the string input by the user, and 'no' is appended to the `results` list if `n` is even. If `n` is odd, either 'yes' or 'no' is appended to the `results` list based on whether the count of 'U' in `arr` is greater than the count of 'D'.
