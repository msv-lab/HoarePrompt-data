Output State: **`sz` is the second element of the list `a`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, and `mexsize` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The code increments `mexsize` by 1. The initial state of `sz` being the second element of the list `a` and `a` being a list of integers sorted in ascending order remains unchanged. The only change is that `mexsize` is now one more than its previous value.
