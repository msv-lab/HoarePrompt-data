Output State: **`tc` is 0, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`, `mexsize` is 1.**

The code sets `mexsize` to 1, which does not affect the values of `tc`, `t`, `n`, `a`, or `maxsize`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
