Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is the last element of the list `a`.
- `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a` and it is greater than `maxsize`.
- The list `a` remains unchanged.
- The condition for the print statement is `mexsize % 2 == 0`.

To determine what will be printed, we need to evaluate the expression `mexsize % 2 == 0`.

Since `mexsize` is described as the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a` and it is greater than `maxsize`, it must be a positive integer. The key point here is whether this integer is even or odd.

Given that `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`, it could be any positive integer starting from 1. Since it is specified that `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, it means `mexsize` is at least 1 and could be any higher value. However, the specific value of `mexsize` is not provided, but we know it is an integer.

The expression `mexsize % 2 == 0` checks if `mexsize` is even. Without the exact value of `mexsize`, we cannot definitively say whether it is even or odd. But based on the problem setup, we can infer that `mexsize` is an integer and thus either even or odd.

Therefore, the print statement will evaluate to either `'Alice'` or `'Bob'` depending on whether `mexsize` is even or odd.

Output: **'Alice' if mexsize is even else 'Bob'**
