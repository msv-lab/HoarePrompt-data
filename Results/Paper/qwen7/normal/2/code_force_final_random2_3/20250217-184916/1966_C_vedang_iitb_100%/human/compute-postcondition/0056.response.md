Postcondition: **The list `a` has been fully iterated over, meaning `sz` is now the last element of the list `a`. `mexsize` has been incremented each time it matched an element `sz` in the list `a`. The final value of `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`. `mexsize` is compared to `maxsize`, and if `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, the function continues with `mexsize` as is. If `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`, the function also continues with `mexsize` as is. The list `a` itself remains unchanged from its initial state, and `sz` will hold the last element of `a`.**
