Output State: **`tc` is the previous value of `tc` + 1, `t` is the same as before, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores the resulting list in variable `a`. The values of `tc`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
