Output State: **t is an input integer, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and the list of integers a (length n) represents the initial number of stones in each pile, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This changes the value of `t` to the input integer, while the conditions and values of other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) is now satisfied with the new value of `t`. The other variables (`n` and the list `a`) are not yet defined and will be set in subsequent steps.
