Output State: The list `a` has been fully iterated over, meaning `sz` is now the last element of the list `a`. `mexsize` has been incremented each time it matched an element `sz` in the list `a`. The final value of `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `mexsize` will be the smallest positive integer that does not appear in the original list `a`. The list `a` itself remains unchanged from its initial state, and `sz` will hold the last element of `a`.
