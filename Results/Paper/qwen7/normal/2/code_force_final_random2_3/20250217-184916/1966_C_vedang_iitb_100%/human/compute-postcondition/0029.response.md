Postcondition: `tc` is 0, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with all elements removed, `maxsize` is 0 (since the list `a` is now empty), and `mexsize` is 5. Whether `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize` or not, the values of `tc`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `maxsize`, and `mexsize` remain unchanged.
