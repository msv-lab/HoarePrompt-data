Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is the last element of the list `a`.
- `mexsize` has been incremented by 1 for every occurrence where `sz` equals `mexsize`.
- The current value of `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`.

We need to determine the value of `mexsize` to decide whether it is even or odd. Since `mexsize` is incremented by 1 for every occurrence where `sz` equals `mexsize`, and `mexsize` is currently greater than `maxsize`, we know that `sz` must have been equal to `mexsize` at least once.

Given that `mexsize` is incremented by 1 for each match, `mexsize` must be an integer greater than `maxsize`. Therefore, `mexsize` is an odd number because it starts from a value greater than `maxsize` and increments by 1 each time it matches `sz`.

The expression `'Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 0 else 'Bob'` checks if `mexsize` is even or odd. Since `mexsize` is odd, the condition `mexsize % 2 == 0` will be false.

Thus, the print statement will output 'Bob'.

Output: **Bob**
