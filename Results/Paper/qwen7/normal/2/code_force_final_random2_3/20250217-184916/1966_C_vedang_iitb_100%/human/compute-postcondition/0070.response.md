Output State: **`mexsize` is `mexsize` + 1, `sz` is the second element of the list `a`, and `a` is a non-empty list of sorted integers.**

Explanation: The code `mexsize = mexsize + 1` increments the value of `mexsize` by 1. The values of `sz` and the list `a` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
