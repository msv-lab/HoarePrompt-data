Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `tc` and `t`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `t` times, where `tc` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `t-1`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `a` is the list that has been fully iterated over.
   - `sz` is the last element of the list `a`.
   - `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.
   - `maxsize` is a variable that holds some comparison value (not specified in the given information).

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - `tc` needs to be incremented by 1 from its current value.
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is the total number of iterations.

Given the above points, let's formulate the new state:

- `tc` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `t` remains the same.

Since no other variables are mentioned in the loop head, we don't need to adjust any other states.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`tc` is the previous value of `tc` + 1, `t` is the same as before**
