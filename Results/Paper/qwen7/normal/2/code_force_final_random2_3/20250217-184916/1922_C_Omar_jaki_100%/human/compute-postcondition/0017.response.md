Output State: `t` is `t - 2 * n`, where `n` is the total number of iterations, `a` is a tuple with at least `4 + n` elements, `b` is `[0, 0, b[-2] + v, b[-1] + v * (v > z - y) + b[-2] + v * (v > x - w)]` extended by `n-3` additional elements each calculated based on the same logic as the third iteration, `v` is `y - x`, `x` is the initial value of `x`, `y` is the initial value of `y`, `w` is the initial value of `w`, and `z` is the initial value of `z`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `t` will have decreased by `2 * n`, where `n` is the total number of iterations. The tuple `a` will have at least `4 + n` elements. The list `b` will have been updated multiple times based on the conditions provided in the loop body, and will contain `n+2` elements in total. The variables `v`, `x`, `y`, `w`, and `z` retain their values from the initial state and are used to calculate the updates to `b`.
