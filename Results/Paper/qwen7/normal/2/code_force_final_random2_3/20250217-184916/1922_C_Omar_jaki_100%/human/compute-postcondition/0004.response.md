Output State: **`t` is `t - 2`**

Explanation: Initially, `t` is set to `t - 1`. After executing `r()`, the value of `t` is further decremented by 1, making it `t - 2`. The function `r()` is called but no specific action within the function is provided, so we only update `t` based on the given operations.
