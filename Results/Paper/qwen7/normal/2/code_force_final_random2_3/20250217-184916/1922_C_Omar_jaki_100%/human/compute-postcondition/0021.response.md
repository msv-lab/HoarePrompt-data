Output State: **`t` is `t - 2 * n`, `a` is a tuple with at least `n + 3` elements, `b` is `[0, 0, b[-2] + v, b[-1] + v * (v > z - y) + b[-2] + v * (v > x - w)]` extended for each iteration, `v` is `y - x`, `u` is `u - 1` and `u` must be truthy.**

Explanation: The code `u -= 1` decrements the value of `u` by 1. Since `u` must be truthy, it means that after decrementing, `u` should still be truthy. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
