Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `u` is the value returned by `r()`, `t` is `t - 2 * n - 1`, `a` is a tuple with at least 5 elements where the first element is `-1000000000.0`, the second and third elements are `c` and `d` respectively, the fourth element is `2000000000.0`, and the rest of the elements depend on the values returned by `r()` during each iteration, `b` is a list where the last two elements are the sum of the second last and the value of `v` raised to the power of `v > x - w` and `v` raised to the power of `v > z - y` respectively, `v` is the difference between the third and second elements of `a` after the last iteration.
Code of the loop:
while u:
    u -= 1
    c, d = r()
    if c < d:
        print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
    else:
        print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `u` is `u - 1`, `c` is the return value of `r()`. If `c` is less than `d`, then `d` is the second return value of `r()`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`, and `d` remains the second return value of `r()`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `u` is at least 0, `c` is the return value of `r()`, and `d` is either the second return value of `r()` or the value of `c` if `c` is less than the second return value of `r()`. This holds true whether the condition `c < d` is met or not.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `u` is at least 0, `c` is the return value of `r()`, and `d` is the second return value of `r()`. Regardless of whether `c < d` is true or false, the values of `u`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
