Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\), and `ans` is the maximum value between the previous value of `ans` and `x // i`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and `x // i`. Since `i` is 2, `x` is an input integer within the specified range, and `ans` is updated based on the condition involving `x // i`, the output state reflects these changes. The value of `i` remains unchanged, `x` remains an input integer within the specified range, and `ans` is now the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`.
