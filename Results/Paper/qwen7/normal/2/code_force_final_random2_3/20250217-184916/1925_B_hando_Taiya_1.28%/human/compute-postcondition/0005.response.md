Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\) and the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`, and `n` is less than or equal to the integer division of `x` by `i`; `ans` is the maximum value between the previous value of `ans` and `i`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `ans` to be the maximum value between its current value and `i`. Since `i` is initially 1, `ans` will be updated to 1 if `ans` was previously less than 1 (which it cannot be since it's not initialized and we assume it starts at 0 or lower). The values of `x` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not directly involved in the operation.
