Postcondition: `i` is 1, `x` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\), and the current value of `x` is either divisible by `i` or not divisible by `n`. In both cases, `ans` is the maximum value between the previous value of `ans` and the appropriate value derived from `x` and `i`. Specifically, if `n` is less than or equal to the integer division of `x` by `i`, `ans` is updated to the maximum of the previous `ans` and `i` (from the if part), otherwise `ans` is updated to the maximum of the previous `ans` and `x // i` (from the else part).
