Output State: The final value of `ans` will be the largest integer \( k \) such that \( 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \sqrt{x} \rfloor \) and either \( n \leq \frac{x}{k} \) or \( n \leq k \). This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `ans` will hold the maximum value that satisfies one of the conditions specified within the loop for any divisor pair of `x`.

In simpler terms, `ans` will be the greatest divisor of `x` (from 1 to \(\lfloor \sqrt{x} \rfloor\)) such that either `n` is less than or equal to `x` divided by this divisor or `n` is less than or equal to the divisor itself.
