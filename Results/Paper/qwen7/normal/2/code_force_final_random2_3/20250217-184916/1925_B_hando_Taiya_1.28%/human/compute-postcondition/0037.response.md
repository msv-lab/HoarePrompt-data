Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes three variables t, x, and n where t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, x and n are positive integers such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x. It returns a result based on the values of x and n for each test case within the given range of t.**
