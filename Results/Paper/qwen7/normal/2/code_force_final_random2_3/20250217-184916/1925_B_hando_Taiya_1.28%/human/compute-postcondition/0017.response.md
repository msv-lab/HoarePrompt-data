Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\), and `ans` is the maximum value between the previous value of `ans` and `i`.**

Explanation: The code snippet updates `ans` to be the maximum value between the previous value of `ans` and `i`. Since `i` is 2, `ans` will be updated to 2 if it was less than 2, or remain unchanged if it was already 2 or greater. The value of `x` remains unchanged as it is an input integer within the specified range, and no new conditions are introduced that would affect its value or the relationship between `ans`, `i`, and `x`.
