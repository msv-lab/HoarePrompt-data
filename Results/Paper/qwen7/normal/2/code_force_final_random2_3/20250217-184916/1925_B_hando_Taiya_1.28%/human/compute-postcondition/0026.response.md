Output State: **`i` is 3, `ans` is 3**

Explanation: The code `ans = max(ans, i)` updates `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and `i`. Initially, `ans` is not defined, so it defaults to `i` which is 3. Since `i` is 3 and there's no initial value for `ans` given, `ans` is set to 3. The value of `i` remains unchanged.
