Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, x is an input integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8, n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x**.

The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state and no operation was performed on it within the given code snippet. The values of `x` and `n` are dependent on the input provided by the user, hence they are described as input integers with specified ranges.
