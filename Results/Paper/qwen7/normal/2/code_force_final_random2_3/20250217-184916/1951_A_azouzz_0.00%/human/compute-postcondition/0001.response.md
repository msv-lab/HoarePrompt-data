Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `t`, which is used as the range parameter.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `t`**: The initial state of `t` is given as an input integer.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. If `t` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop body is omitted, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that start <= end, `t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0**
