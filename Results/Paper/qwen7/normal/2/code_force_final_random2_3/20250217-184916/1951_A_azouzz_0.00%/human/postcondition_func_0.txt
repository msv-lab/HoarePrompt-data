The function reads multiple test cases where each case consists of an integer `n` followed by a binary string `s`. It checks if the string `s` meets certain conditions: if the count of '1's is greater than 2 and even, it prints 'YES'; if the count of '1's is greater than 2 and odd, or if '11' is a substring of `s`, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it also prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the results for each case and returns nothing.
