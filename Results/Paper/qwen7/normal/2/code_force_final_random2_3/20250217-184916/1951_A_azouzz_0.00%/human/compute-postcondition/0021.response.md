Postcondition: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string from the user, and the count of '1' in the string `s` is less than or equal to 2 or the count of '1' in the string `s` is even. Additionally, the count of '1' in the string `s` is not greater than 2 and is not odd or equal to 1, and the substring '11' is either present in the string `s` (in which case the count of '1' is at least 2 and is even) or absent from the string `s` (in which case the count of '1' is less than or equal to 2 and is even).
