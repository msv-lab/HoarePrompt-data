Postcondition: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `n` is the new input integer, `s` is the input string from the user, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in the string `s`, `s` is updated to the input string from the user, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in the updated string `s`. If `cnt1` > 2 and `cnt1` is even, then `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `cnt1` remain unchanged. Otherwise, if `cnt1` > 2 and `cnt1` is odd or `cnt1` == 1, `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `cnt1` also remain unchanged. If `s` contains '11', then `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `s`, and `cnt1` remain unchanged.**
