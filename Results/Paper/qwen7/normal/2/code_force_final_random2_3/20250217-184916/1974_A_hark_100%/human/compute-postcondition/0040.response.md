Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `ap` is a positive integer, `k` is `k + 1`, `x` is `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, `y` is the second integer input from the user, `bxsfory` is the ceiling value of `y / 2`, `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` <= 0 else the ceiling value of `(x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4) / 15`**.

Explanation: 
- The variable `bxsfory1` is assigned based on the condition `0 if x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4 <= 0 else math.ceil((x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4) / 15)`. This means if the expression `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is less than or equal to 0, then `bxsfory1` is 0. Otherwise, `bxsfory1` is the ceiling value of the division of `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` by 15. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
