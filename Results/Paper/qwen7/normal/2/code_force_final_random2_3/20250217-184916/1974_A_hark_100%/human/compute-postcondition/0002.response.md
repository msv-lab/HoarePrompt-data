Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `ap` must be a positive integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `x` and `y` respectively. The values of `t` and `ap` remain unchanged from their initial state.
