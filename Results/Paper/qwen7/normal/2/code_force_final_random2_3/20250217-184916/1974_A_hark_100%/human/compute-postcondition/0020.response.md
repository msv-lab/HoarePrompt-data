Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` must be a positive integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, and either `x` is less than or equal to 0 or `y` is less than or equal to 0. This holds true whether `x` is equal to 0 and `y` is greater than 0 or `x` is not equal to 0 and `y` is not greater than 0.
