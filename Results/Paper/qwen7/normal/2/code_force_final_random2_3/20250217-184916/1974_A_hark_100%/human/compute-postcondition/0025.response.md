Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `ap` is a positive integer, `k` is `k + 1`, `x` is the first integer input, `y` is the second integer input.**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `x` and `y` respectively. The values of `t`, `ap`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
