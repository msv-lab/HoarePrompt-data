Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is a positive integer, `x` is an input integer, and `y` is an input integer. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, where `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x` <= 0 else `math.ceil(x / 15)`. If either `x` is less than or equal to 0 or `y` is less than or equal to 0, the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.
