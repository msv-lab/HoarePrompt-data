Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is an input integer
Code of the loop:
for k in range(ap):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if x > 0 and y > 0:
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
    elif x == 0 and y > 0:
        print(math.ceil(y / 2))
    elif x > 0 and y == 0:
        print(math.ceil(x / 15))
    else:
        print(0)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is a positive integer, `x` is an input integer, and `y` is an input integer. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, where `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x` <= 0 else `math.ceil(x / 15)`. If either `x` is less than or equal to 0 or `y` is less than or equal to 0, the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `ap` is a positive integer, `k` is `k + 1`, `x` is either `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` where `bxsfory` is the ceiling value of `y / 2` and `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4 <= 0` else `math.ceil((x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4) / 15)`, or `x` remains the first integer input, depending on whether `x > 0` and `y > 0` is true or false. `y` remains the second integer input in both cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `ap` is a positive integer, `k` is `k + 1`. If `x > 0` and `y > 0`, then `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, where `bxsfory` is the ceiling value of `y / 2`, and `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is less than or equal to 0, else `bxsfory1` is the ceiling value of `(x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4) / 15`. If either `x` or `y` is not greater than 0, then `x` remains the first integer input from the user and `y` remains the second integer input from the user.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
