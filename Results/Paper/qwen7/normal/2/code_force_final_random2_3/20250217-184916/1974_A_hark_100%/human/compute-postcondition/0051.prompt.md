You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, x and y are non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.
def func_1():
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        if x > 0 and y > 0:
            bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
            x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
            bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)
            print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
        elif x == 0 and y > 0:
            print(math.ceil(y / 2))
        elif x > 0 and y == 0:
            print(math.ceil(x / 15))
        else:
            print(0)
        
    #State: The loop has executed all its iterations, and the final state of the variables is as follows: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `ap` is a positive integer, and `k` is equal to `ap`. The values of `x` and `y` are the result of applying the operations within the loop for each iteration specified by `ap`. Specifically, for each iteration, if `x > 0` and `y > 0`, `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, where `bxsfory` is the ceiling value of `y / 2`, and `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is less than or equal to 0, else `bxsfory1` is the ceiling value of `(x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4) / 15`. If either `x` or `y` is not greater than 0, `x` remains the first integer input from the user and `y` remains the second integer input from the user.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes test cases where each case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and pairs of non-negative integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99). For each test case, it performs some unspecified operation and returns the result based on the input values.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
