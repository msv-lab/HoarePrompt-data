Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` must be a positive integer, `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `y` is an input integer greater than 0, `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`. Here, `bxsfory` is the ceiling value of `y` divided by 2. Since `y` is an input integer greater than 0, `bxsfory` is calculated as `math.ceil(y / 2)`. Therefore, `x` is adjusted by subtracting `15` times the ceiling value of `y` divided by 2 and adding `4` times `y`. The values of `t`, `ap`, and `y` remain unchanged.
