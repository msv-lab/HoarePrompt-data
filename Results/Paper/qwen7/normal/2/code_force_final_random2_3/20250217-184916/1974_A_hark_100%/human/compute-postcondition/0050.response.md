Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes test cases where each case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and pairs of non-negative integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99). For each test case, it performs some unspecified operation and returns the result based on the input values.**

Note: The exact operation to be performed on `t`, `x`, and `y` is not specified in the given information, so the functionality description focuses on the parameters and their constraints.
