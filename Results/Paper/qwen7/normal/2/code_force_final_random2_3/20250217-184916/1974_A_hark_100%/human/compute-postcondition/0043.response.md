Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `ap` is a positive integer.
- `k` is `k + 1`, but the value of `k` itself is not relevant to the print statement.
- `x` is the first integer input from the user.
- `y` is the second integer input from the user.

The print statement is `print(math.ceil(x / 15))`.

Here, `math.ceil(x / 15)` will take the value of `x` (the first integer input from the user), divide it by 15, and then apply the ceiling function to round up to the nearest integer.

Therefore, the output will be the result of this operation, which depends on the value of `x` provided by the user.

Output: **math.ceil(x / 15) (where x is the first integer input from the user)**
