Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `ap` must be a positive integer.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is an input integer.
- `x` is greater than 0.
- `y` is equal to 0.
- Either `x` is less than or equal to 0 or `y` is less than or equal to 0. 

Given these conditions, since `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is equal to 0, the condition "either `x` is less than or equal to 0 or `y` is less than or equal to 0" is not met. However, this condition does not affect the calculation of the `math.ceil(x / 15)` expression because it only serves as a constraint on the inputs and does not influence the arithmetic operation directly.

The expression `math.ceil(x / 15)` will take the value of `x` and divide it by 15, then round up to the nearest integer if the division result is not already an integer.

Since `x` is greater than 0, the output will be the ceiling of `x / 15`.

Output: **math.ceil(x / 15)**
