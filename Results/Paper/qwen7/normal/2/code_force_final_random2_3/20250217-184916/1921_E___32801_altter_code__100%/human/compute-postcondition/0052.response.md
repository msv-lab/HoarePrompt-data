Output State: **The program returns the absolute difference between y2 and y1, which is t.**

Given the conditions:
- \( t \) is the absolute difference between \( y2 \) and \( y1 \).
- \( y2 \) is either \( m \) or \( 1 \) depending on the condition.
- \( x2 \) is greater than \( x1 \).
- \( y1 \) is not equal to \( y2 \).

Since the return statement does not specify any particular calculation but rather indicates that the function is returning something, and given the context that \( t \) is defined as \( abs(y2 - y1) \), the program returns the value of \( t \).
