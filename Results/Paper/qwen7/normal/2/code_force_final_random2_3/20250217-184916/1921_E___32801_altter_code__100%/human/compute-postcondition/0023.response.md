Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is increased by 1, `y1` is decreased by 1, `x2` is the fifth element of `r`, `y2` is the sixth element of `r`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, and the current value of `y1` is greater than or equal to `y2`; `a` is `y2 - 1`.**

This means that the value of `a` is now set to `y2 - 1`, while all other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
