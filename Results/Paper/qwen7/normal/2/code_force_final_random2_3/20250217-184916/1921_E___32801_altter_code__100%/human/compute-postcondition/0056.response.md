Output State: **The program returns the absolute difference between y2 and y1, which is t.**

Given the conditions:
- `t` is calculated as `abs(y2 - y1)`.
- The value of `t` is provided as part of the initial state and is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `y2` is either `m` or `1` depending on some unspecified condition.
- `y1` is decreased by `1 + a`.

Since the return statement does not depend on any further computation but rather directly references `t`, the program returns the value of `t`.
