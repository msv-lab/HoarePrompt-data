Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, r is a list containing six integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, n is the first element of r, m is the second element of r, x1 is the third element of r, y1 is the fourth element of r, x2 is the fifth element of r, y2 is the sixth element of r.**

Explanation: The code unpacks the list `r` into six variables: `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the assignment operation. The list `r` retains its original state with the first six elements assigned to the new variables.
