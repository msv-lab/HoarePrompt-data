Output State: **`r` is a list containing six integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is increased by `a`, `y1` is decreased by 1 plus `a`, `x2` is the fifth element of `r`, `y2` is `m`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `x2` is decreased by `a`, the condition `(x2 > x1 and x1 ≥ 1 and x2 ≤ n and y2 > y1)` holds, `y1` is decreased by `a`, `c` is `m - y1`.**

Explanation: 
- The value of `c` is calculated as `m - y1`. Since `y1` was previously defined as being decreased by `a` and `1`, the new value of `y1` is `m - a - 1`. Thus, `c` is now `m - (m - a - 1)`, which simplifies to `a + 1`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged as per the initial state.
