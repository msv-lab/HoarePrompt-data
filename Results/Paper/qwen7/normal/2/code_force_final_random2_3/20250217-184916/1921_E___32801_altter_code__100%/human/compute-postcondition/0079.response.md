Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is a list containing six integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `n` is the first element of `r`, `m` is the second element of `r`, `x1` is the third element of `r` increased by `a`, `y1` is 1, `x2` is the fifth element of `r`, `y2` is the sixth element of `r`, and `y1` is not equal to `y2`. `b` is `x2 - x1`, `t` is the absolute value of `y2 - y1`, `x2` is decreased by `a`, `x2` is greater than or equal to `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`. Additionally, `y1` is less than or equal to `y2`.**

In this output state, `y1` is explicitly set to 1, while all other conditions and relationships between variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
