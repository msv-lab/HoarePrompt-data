Reasoning:

1. **Function Structure**: The function `func_1()` correctly processes the input for each test case and checks the conditions for determining the winner.
2. **Initial Conditions Check**: The function starts by checking if `x2 <= x1`, which is a condition for an immediate draw. This is correctly implemented.
3. **Odd Difference Check**: When `(x2 - x1) % 2 != 0`, the function checks if `y1 == y2`. If true, it prints 'Alice'. This is a correct logic for Alice winning when the vertical distance is odd and the initial y-coordinates are the same.
4. **Movement Logic**: The function handles different movement scenarios based on the relative positions of `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, and `y2`. It updates the positions of the chips and checks if the new positions allow Alice or Bob to win.
5. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases such as out-of-boundary conditions and ensures that the movements are within the board limits.
6. **Return Values**: The function returns 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'draw' based on the logic implemented, which matches the expected outputs.

Given the detailed analysis, the function correctly implements the rules and logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
