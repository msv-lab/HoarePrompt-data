Output State: **The program returns the total number of trailing zeros in the string representation of `num`**.

This is because the loop decrements `i` from the length of `num` down to 0, checking each character from the end of the string. For each character that is '0', `tot` is incremented. Once a non-zero character is encountered or `i` reaches 0, the loop ends. Thus, `tot` holds the count of trailing zeros in `num`. The function then returns this count.
