You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, representing an element in the list provided to Anna.
def zerocnts(num):
    num = str(num)
    tot = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] != '0':
            break
        
        tot += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `num` is a string representation of an integer between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive, `i` is 0, `tot` is the length of `num`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to decrement `i` until it encounters a character in `num` that is not '0'. Since the loop increments `tot` each time it iterates without breaking, `tot` will count the number of trailing zeros in `num`. Once `i` reaches 0 (meaning there are no more characters left to check), the loop terminates. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will be 0, and `tot` will be equal to the total number of trailing zeros in `num`.
    return tot
    #The program returns the total number of trailing zeros in the string representation of `num`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter num, which is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. It returns the total number of trailing zeros in the string representation of `num`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the total number of trailing zeros in the string representation of `num`


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
