Output State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive, `i` is len(num) - 3, `tot` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block specified in the code snippet, the only effect is that we acknowledge the break statement has been executed. All other variables retain their initial states.
