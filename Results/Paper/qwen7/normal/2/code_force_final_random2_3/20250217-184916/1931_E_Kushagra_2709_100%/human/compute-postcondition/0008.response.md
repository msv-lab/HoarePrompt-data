Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
   - `num` is a string representation of an integer between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive.
   - `i` is `len(num) - 1`.
   - `tot` is 1.

2. **Loop Head**: The for loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Variables**: The only variables involved in the loop head are `i`.

4. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates from `len(num) - 1` down to 0 (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time.

5. **Adjusting States**: At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be decremented by 1. Therefore, if `i` was `len(num) - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, it will become `len(num) - 2` at the start of the next iteration.

6. **New State**: Since `i` is the only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted, we update `i` to `len(num) - 2`.

7. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`num` and `tot`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:
- `num` is a string representation of an integer between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive.
- `i` is `len(num) - 2`.
- `tot` is 1.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive, `i` is `len(num) - 2`, `tot` is 1**.
