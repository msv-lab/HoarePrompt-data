### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Function `zerocnts(num)`:
- This function correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of `num`.
- It works by iterating over the string representation of `num` from the end to the beginning, counting the number of '0' characters until it finds a non-zero character.
- The function returns the count of trailing zeros, which is correct.

#### Function `func_1(n, m, nums)`:
- **Initialization**: 
  - `tot` is initialized to the total length of the string representations of all numbers in `nums`.
  - `cntvals` is a list of the number of trailing zeros in each number in `nums`, sorted in descending order.
- **Loop**:
  - The loop iterates over `cntvals` in steps of 2, starting from the first element.
  - In each iteration, `tot` is decreased by the value at the current index.
- **Return Statement**:
  - The function returns 'Sasha' if `tot` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, otherwise it returns 'Anna'.

To understand why this logic is correct, we need to consider the game rules:
- Anna reverses the digits of some number, which does not change the total length of the numbers.
- Sasha concatenates two numbers, which increases the total length by the length of the second number minus 1 (since one number is removed).

Given that Sasha needs to reduce the total length of the numbers to less than `m + 1` to win, the logic in `func_1` effectively checks if the total length of the numbers can be reduced to less than `m + 1` after Anna's optimal moves.

The key insight is that the number of trailing zeros in a number does not affect the total length reduction directly but helps in determining the optimal strategy. By sorting the number of trailing zeros in descending order and subtracting every second element, the function ensures that the most significant reductions in length are considered first.

#### Overall Analysis:
- The function `zerocnts` correctly counts trailing zeros.
- The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the total length of the numbers and the parameter `m`.

Since both functions work as intended and the overall logic aligns with the problem statement, the given solution is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
