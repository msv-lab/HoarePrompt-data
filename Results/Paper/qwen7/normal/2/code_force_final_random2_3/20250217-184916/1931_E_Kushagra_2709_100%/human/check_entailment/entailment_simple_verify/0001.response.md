### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the key aspects of the problem and the logic implemented in the `func_1` function. However, there are some inaccuracies and oversights in the detailed analysis that need to be addressed:

1. **Summing Lengths:**
   - The sum of the lengths of the numbers after Anna's moves is correctly calculated using `tot = sum((len(val) for val in map(str, nums)))`.

2. **Sorting Zero Counts:**
   - The sorting of zero counts in descending order (`cntvals = sorted((zerocnts(val) for val in nums), reverse=True)`) is unnecessary and does not contribute to the final decision-making process. This step is indeed redundant and does not impact the correctness of the function.

3. **Subtracting Every Second Value:**
   - The loop `for i in range(0, len(cntvals), 2):` iterates over every second value in the sorted list and subtracts it from `tot`. This step is intended to simulate Sasha's concatenation moves, but it is flawed. The idea is to reduce the effective length of the numbers by considering Sasha's moves, but the implementation is incorrect. Specifically, the zero counts do not directly relate to the lengths of the numbers after concatenation. Instead, the function should focus on the lengths of the numbers themselves.

4. **Winning Condition:**
   - The function returns `'Sasha' if tot >= m + 1 else 'Anna'`. This condition checks if the total length is at least \(m+1\), which is correct for determining Sasha's win.

### Correct Implementation

To correctly implement the logic, we should focus on the lengths of the numbers after Anna's moves. Here is the corrected approach:

1. Calculate the sum of the lengths of the numbers after Anna's moves.
2. Check if the total length is at least \(m+1\).

Here is the corrected `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, nums):
    tot = sum(len(str(val)) for val in nums)
    return 'Sasha' if tot >= m + 1 else 'Anna'
```

This function correctly sums the lengths of the numbers and checks if the total length is at least \(m+1\).

### Conclusion

The original assessment is mostly correct but overlooks the unnecessary and incorrect steps in the `func_1` function. The core logic of checking the total length is correct, but the intermediate steps involving zero counts and subtracting every second value are incorrect.

**Final: False**

The given program is not entirely correct due to the flawed implementation of Sasha's moves through zero counts and subtracting every second value.
