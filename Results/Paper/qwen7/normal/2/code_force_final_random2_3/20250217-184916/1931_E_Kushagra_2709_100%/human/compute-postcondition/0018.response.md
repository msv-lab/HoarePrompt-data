Output State: `num` is a string representation of an integer between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive, `i` is -1, `tot` is the length of `num`.

Explanation: The loop continues to decrement `i` until it encounters a character in `num` that is not '0' or until `i` becomes -1 (which happens when all characters in `num` are '0'). Since the loop increments `tot` each time it iterates without breaking, `tot` will eventually equal the length of `num` once `i` reaches -1. At this point, the loop terminates.
