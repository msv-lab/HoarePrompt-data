Output State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive, `i` is `len(num) - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `num` and `i`. It only indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the given code, the values of `num` and `i` remain unchanged.
