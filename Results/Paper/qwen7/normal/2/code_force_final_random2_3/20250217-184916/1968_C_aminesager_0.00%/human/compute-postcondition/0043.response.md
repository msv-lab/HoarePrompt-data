Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `line` is an input string, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `line` by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list containing the values 1000 and `a[0] - T[0]`.**

Explanation: The code appends to the list `a` the value of `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`, where `i` is 1. Since `a` initially contains only the value 1000 (at index 0), and `T` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string `line`, the new value appended to `a` is `a[0] - T[0]`, which is `1000 - T[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
