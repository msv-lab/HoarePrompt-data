Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial state.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t = t - 1
    n = int(input())
    line = input('')
    T = list(map(int, line.split()))
    a = [1000]
    for i in range(1, n):
        a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])
    a = a[::-1]
    result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The list `a` is joined into a string with each element separated by a space, and `i` is equal to `n`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is `n-1`; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is [1000, 999, 998, ..., 2, 1]; `result` is '1000 999 998 ... 2 1'
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `line` remains as the input string, `T` remains as the list of integers obtained from splitting `line` by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list starting with the value 1000 followed by `n-1` elements, each being the difference between the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `T`, `result` is a string obtained by joining the elements of the list `a` converted to strings with a space as the separator, and `a` is reversed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
