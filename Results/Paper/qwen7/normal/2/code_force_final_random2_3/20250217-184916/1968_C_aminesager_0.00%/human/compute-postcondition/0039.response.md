Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `line` is an input string**

The code `line = input('')` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `line`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still holds the value 0, and `n` remains an input integer as it was not affected by the code.
