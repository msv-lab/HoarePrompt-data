Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `line` is an input string, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `line` by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list containing the values 1000, `a[0] - T[0]`, and `a` is appended with the value of `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]` where `i` is `n - 1` plus one additional element which is `a[n-2] - T[n-2]`**.

In simpler terms, the list `a` now includes one more element, which is calculated as `a[n-2] - T[n-2]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
