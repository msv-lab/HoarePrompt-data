Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, the condition `i < n` must be true.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `a` contains an element which is `a[0] - T[0]`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented to 2 (because the loop starts from 1 and increments by default).
   - `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.
   - The variable `a` does not change within the loop head and remains as `a[0] - T[0]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `a` contains an element which is `a[0] - T[0]`

So, the final state is:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` contains an element which is `a[0] - T[0]`**
