Output State: **`i` is `n-1`; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is [1000, 999, 998, ..., 2, 1]; `result` is '1000 999 998 ... 2 1'**

Explanation: The code `result = ' '.join(map(str, a))` converts the list `a` into a string where each element is converted to a string and joined with a space. Given the initial state, the list `a` is [1000, 999, 998, ..., 2, 1] (with `n-1` elements). After executing the code, `result` is set to the string representation of this list, which is '1000 999 998 ... 2 1'. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the structure of the list `a` also remains unchanged, only its representation changes to a string.
