Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all its iterations will have the following characteristics:

`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(", ")". The value of `i` will be equal to the length of `s` minus 1, as the loop iterates over each character in the string using `enumerate`. The `balance` variable will be 0 because the input string `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence, meaning every opening parenthesis "(" has a corresponding closing parenthesis ")". The `details` list will contain a total of `len(s) + 1` tuples, with each tuple representing the balance, the negative index of the current character, and the character itself at each step of the loop. Each tuple in the `details` list will follow the format `(balance, -i, char)`, capturing the state of the balance and the position of the character in the string as the loop progresses.
