Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(", ")", `i` is 0, and the balance is -1.**

Explanation: The initial state indicates that `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(", ")", `i` is 0, and the first character of `s` is not "(" (implying it starts with ")"). The code `balance -= 1` decreases the value of `balance` by 1. Since no specific initial value for `balance` was given, we assume it started at 0, and after executing the code, it becomes -1. All other variables remain unchanged.
