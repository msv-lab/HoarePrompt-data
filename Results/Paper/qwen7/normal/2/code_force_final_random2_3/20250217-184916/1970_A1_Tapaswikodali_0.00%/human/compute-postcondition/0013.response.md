Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(", ")", `i` is 2, `balance` is either 2 or 0 depending on the first character of `s`, `details` is a list containing two tuples `(balance, -1, first_char)` and `(balance, -1, second_char)` where `first_char` is the first character of `s` and `second_char` is the second character of `s`.**

Explanation: The value of `balance` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `balance` was either 1 or -1 depending on the first character of `s`, after adding 1, the new value of `balance` will be either 2 (if initially it was 1) or 0 (if initially it was -1). The other variables (`s`, `i`, `details`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
