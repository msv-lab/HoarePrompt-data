Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(", ")", `i` is 1, `balance` is either 0 or -2 depending on the first character of `s`, `details` is a list containing two tuples `(balance-1, -1, first_char)` and `(balance-1, -1, second_char)` where `first_char` is the first character of `s` and `second_char` is the second character of `s`.**

Explanation: The `balance` variable is decremented by 1. Since `balance` was either 1 or -1 initially, it will now be either 0 or -2 respectively. The `details` list contains tuples where the first element is updated to `balance - 1`, while the second and third elements remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
