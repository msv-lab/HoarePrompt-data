Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the input string `s` and initializes variables to track the balance of parentheses and store intermediate results.
2. It iterates through the string, updating the balance and storing the necessary information in the `details` list.
3. After processing all characters, it sorts the `details` list based on the balance values and the negative indices of the characters.
4. Finally, it constructs the result string by concatenating the characters from the sorted `details` list and prints it.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the function appears to follow the correct logic for performing the balanced shuffle operation. The steps are logically sound and should produce the expected output based on the provided input.

Correctness: **True**
