Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for (i, char) in enumerate(s):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `char`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(", ")".
   - `i` is 0.
   - `balance` is either 1 or -1 depending on the first character of `s`.
   - `details` is a list containing one tuple `(balance, -i, char)` where `char` is the first character of `s`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are more characters in the string `s` to process. This means `i` should be less than the length of `s`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
   - `char` will be the next character in the string `s`.

5. **Determine the updated values**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 1 for the next iteration.
   - `char` will be the second character in the string `s`.

6. **Ensure the loop can continue**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than the length of `s`. Given that `s` is non-empty, `i` being 1 means the loop can still continue if `s` has more than one character.

7. **Update the `balance` and `details`**:
   - The `balance` remains unchanged unless the character changes, but since we are only looking at the first character, it stays the same.
   - The `details` list will be updated to include the new tuple `(balance, -i, char)`.

Given these points, the updated state for the next iteration would be:

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(", ")", `i` is 1, `balance` is either 1 or -1 depending on the first character of `s`, `details` is a list containing two tuples `(balance, -1, first_char)` and `(balance, -1, second_char)` where `first_char` is the first character of `s` and `second_char` is the second character of `s`.**
