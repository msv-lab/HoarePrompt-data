Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given code are `i` and `char`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(", ")".
   - `i` is either 1 or 2.
   - `balance` is either 0, -2, 2, or 0 depending on the first and second characters of `s`.
   - `details` is a list containing three tuples where the first tuple is (balance, -i, char).

3. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - The loop iterates over the string `s` using `enumerate`, which provides both the index `i` and the character `char` at each position.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 or 2, after the first iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - The character `char` at the current index `i` will be the next character in the string `s`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `char` will be the next character in the string `s`.

6. **Ensure the loop continues**:
   - The loop will continue as long as there are more characters in the string `s`.

Given the above points, let's update the state:

- If `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 2 in the next iteration.
- The `char` will be the second character of the string `s`.

Since `s` is a non-empty string and `i` is either 1 or 2, the string `s` must have at least two characters. Therefore, the loop can continue.

**Final State**:
- `s` remains a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(", ")".
- `i` is now 2.
- `balance` remains the same as it is determined by the first and second characters of `s` and does not change within the loop.
- `details` remains the same as it is determined by the initial state and does not change within the loop.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(", ")", `i` is 2, `balance` is either 0, -2, 2, or 0, `details` is a list containing three tuples where the first tuple is (balance, -i, char)**
