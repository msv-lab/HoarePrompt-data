Output State: **`cnt` is [0, 0], `zeroes` is the number of occurrences of 0 in `s`, `ans` is 0, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged**

The code simply assigns the value `0` to the variable `ans`. Since `ans` was previously unchanged, it now holds the value `0`. The other variables (`cnt`, `zeroes`, `t`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
