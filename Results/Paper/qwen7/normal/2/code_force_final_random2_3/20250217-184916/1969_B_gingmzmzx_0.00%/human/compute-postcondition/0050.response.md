Postcondition: `s` is a list of integers with at least one element, `cnt[0]` is incremented by the number of zeroes in `s` if `c` is not 0, otherwise `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1. `ans` is set to 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0 and remains unchanged otherwise, `c` is the first element of the updated `s`.
