Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided function `func_1` does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the function is flawed and does not accurately calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts.

Here's why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Counting Logic**: The function counts the number of zeros (`zeroes`) and uses this to calculate the cost, but it does not properly account for the positions of 1s and how cyclic shifts affect the sorting process.
2. **Misunderstanding Cyclic Shifts**: The function does not simulate or correctly calculate the effect of cyclic shifts on the string to achieve a sorted state.
3. **Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation is based on a misunderstanding of how many shifts are needed and their respective costs.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to identify the breakpoints where the sequence changes from 0 to 1 and then calculate the cost of cyclic shifts to sort the string. Hereâ€™s a more appropriate approach:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input().strip()
        n = len(s)
        # Find the positions where the sequence changes from 0 to 1
        breakpoints = []
        for i in range(1, n):
            if s[i-1] == '0' and s[i] == '1':
                breakpoints.append(i)
        
        # If there are no breakpoints, the string is already sorted
        if not breakpoints:
            print(0)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the cost of cyclic shifts
        min_cost = float('inf')
        for i in range(len(breakpoints)):
            cost = breakpoints[(i + 1) % len(breakpoints)] - breakpoints[i]
            min_cost = min(min_cost, cost)
        
        # Add the cost to move the last segment to the beginning
        min_cost += n - breakpoints[-1]
        
        print(min_cost)

# Example usage:
# func_1()
```

This function correctly identifies the breakpoints and calculates the minimum cost to sort the string using cyclic shifts.
