### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings. The goal is to minimize the total cost of these operations, where the cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the shifted substring.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` reads an integer `n` which is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers.
   - It counts the number of zeros in the string (`zeroes`).
   - It initializes two counters `cnt` for zeros and ones and a variable `ans` to store the total cost.
   - It iterates through the string and updates the counters and the cost.
   - Finally, it prints the total cost.

3. **Key Issues**:
   - The code reads the binary string as a list of integers, but it should be read as a string to correctly handle the cyclic shifts.
   - The logic to calculate the cost is flawed. The current implementation does not correctly simulate the cyclic shifts and their costs.
   - The approach to finding the minimum cost is not accurate. The given code does not implement the correct algorithm to find the minimum cost.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this problem, we need to identify the positions where we need to perform cyclic shifts to sort the string.
   - We can use a more complex algorithm that identifies the minimum number of cyclic shifts needed and calculates their costs.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is **False**.

**Correctness: **False**
