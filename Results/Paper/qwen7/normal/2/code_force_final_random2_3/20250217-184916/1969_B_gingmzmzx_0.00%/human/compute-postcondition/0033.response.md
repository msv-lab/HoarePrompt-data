Output State: **`ans` is the sum of the number of zeros in the list `s` plus the count of ones in `s` minus 1, `cnt` is [0, 0], `zeroes` is equal to the initial number of zeros in `s`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 1, `s` is updated to a list of integers obtained from input, `zeroes` is now the count of zeros in the list `s`**.

Explanation: The line `cnt = [0, 0]` initializes the list `cnt` to `[0, 0]`. This does not affect the values of `ans`, `zeroes`, `t`, `n`, or the list `s`. The value of `ans` remains as the sum of the number of zeros in the list `s` plus the count of ones in `s` minus 1, and `zeroes` remains the count of zeros in the list `s`. The conditions on `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The list `s` is updated to a list of integers obtained from input, but no further details about its contents are provided.
