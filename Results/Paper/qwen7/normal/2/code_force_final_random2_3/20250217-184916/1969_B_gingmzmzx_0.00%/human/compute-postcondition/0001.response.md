State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `n`, which is used as the range parameter for the `range(n)` function.
2. For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer because `range(n)` generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
3. The variable `t` is not directly involved in determining whether the loop can execute; its value (which is constrained between 1 and \(10^4\)) does not affect the loop's condition.
4. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is ensuring that `n` is greater than 0.

Hence, the state after adjustment should ensure that `n` is greater than 0.
