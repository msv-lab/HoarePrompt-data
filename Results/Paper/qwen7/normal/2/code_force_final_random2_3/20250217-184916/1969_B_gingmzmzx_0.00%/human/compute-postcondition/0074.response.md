Output State: **`c` is the second character of `s`, `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, `ans` is 2 if `cnt[1]` was greater than 0 before the increment, otherwise `ans` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0` checks if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0. If it is, `ans` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. Since `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1 regardless of the condition, the value of `cnt[c]` changes, but the exact value of `ans` depends on the previous value of `cnt[1]`. If `cnt[1]` was greater than 0 before the increment, `ans` will be 2; otherwise, it will remain 1.
