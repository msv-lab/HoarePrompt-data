Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The program attempts to count the number of operations needed to sort the binary string, but it does not actually calculate the minimum cost to perform cyclic shifts to achieve a sorted string. Instead, it seems to be counting something related to the counts of 0s and 1s in the string, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
101011
```

Expected output:
```
9
```

However, the program will produce a different result because it does not correctly compute the minimum cost of cyclic shifts. The correct approach involves identifying the longest prefix that is already sorted and then calculating the cost based on the remaining unsorted part of the string. The provided solution does not account for this logic, leading to incorrect results.
