Output State: **`c` is the first character of `s`; `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1; `ans` is incremented by `zeroes - cnt[0]`.**

Explanation: The code increments `ans` by the difference between `zeroes` and `cnt[0]`. Since `c` is the first character of `s` and `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, these values remain unchanged from their initial state. The only new information is that `ans` has been updated by subtracting the current count of `0` (stored in `cnt[0]`) from the total number of zeroes (`zeroes`).
