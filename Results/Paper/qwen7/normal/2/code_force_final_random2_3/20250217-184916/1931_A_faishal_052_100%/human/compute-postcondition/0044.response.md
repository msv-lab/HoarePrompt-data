Output State: **`i` is 0, `cases` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\), `arr` is either [1, 1, 26], [1, 26, 26], or [26, 26], `lex` is equal to `lex` - 26, `j` is 0**.

Explanation: The variable `lex` is decreased by 26. Since the initial value of `lex` could be reduced by either 1 or 26, the new value of `lex` is now `lex - 26`. All other variables remain unchanged.
