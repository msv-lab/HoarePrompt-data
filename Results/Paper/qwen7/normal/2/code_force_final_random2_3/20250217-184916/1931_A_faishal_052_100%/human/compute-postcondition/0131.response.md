Output State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is `lex` - 1, if `lex` was less than 27, `arr` contains the elements 1 and 1, if `lex` was between 27 (inclusive) and 52 (exclusive), `arr` contains the value 26 and 1, if `lex` was 52 or greater, the state of `arr` remains unchanged and contains the element 1.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decremented by 1. The conditions for the list `arr` remain the same, but the value of `lex` is now `lex - 1`. The initial state of `j` and the conditions for `arr` based on the value of `lex` are preserved.
