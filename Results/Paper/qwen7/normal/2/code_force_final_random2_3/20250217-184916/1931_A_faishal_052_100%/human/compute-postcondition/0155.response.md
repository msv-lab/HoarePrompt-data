Output State: **Postcondition: `j` is 2, `lex` is either `lex - 2`, `lex - 26`, or `lex - 52` depending on the initial value of `lex`. If `lex` was less than 27, `arr` contains the elements [1, 2, 1], [1, 26, 1], [1, 26, 26], or [1, 1, 1]. If `lex` was between 27 (inclusive) and 52 (exclusive), `arr` contains the elements [26, 2, 1], [26, 26, 1], [26, 26, 26], or [26, 1, 1]. If `lex` was 52 or greater, the state of `arr` remains unchanged and contains the elements [26, 1], [26, 26], or [26].**

This output state describes the final conditions of the variables after the loop has completed its iterations. The loop runs twice (`j` goes from 0 to 1), and during each iteration, it appends either 1 or 26 to the list `arr` based on the value of `lex`. Depending on the initial value of `lex`, the final value of `lex` will be reduced by 1, 26, or 52, and the contents of `arr` will reflect the sequence of operations performed by the loop.
