Output State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is either `lex - 26` or `lex - 52` depending on the initial value of `lex`, if `lex` was less than 27, `arr` contains the elements [26, 1] or [26, 26], if `lex` was between 27 (inclusive) and 52 (exclusive), `arr` contains the elements [26, 26] or [26, 1], if `lex` was 52 or greater, the state of `arr` remains unchanged and contains the element [26]**.

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decremented by 26. Depending on the initial value of `lex`, the state of `arr` changes as described. The value of `j` remains unchanged.
