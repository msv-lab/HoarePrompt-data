Output State: **`i` is 0, `cases` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\), `arr` is either [1, 1, 26], [1, 26, 26], or [26, 26], `lex` is `lex` - 26, `j` is 0**.

Explanation: The variable `lex` is decreased by 26. Since `lex` was originally reduced by either 1 or 26, after subtracting another 26, `lex` is now reduced by 27. All other variables remain unchanged.
