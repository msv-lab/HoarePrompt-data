Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given code is `j`.
2. **Determine the loop condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range from 0 to 2 (inclusive), meaning the loop will run three times.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `temp` is the original value of `temp` plus the character corresponding to `info[i][2]` shifted by 96 plus the character corresponding to `info[i][3]` shifted by 96.
   - `j` is 4.

4. **Loop execution**: Since the loop runs for `j` in the range from 0 to 2, the loop will not execute if `j` is 4. Therefore, the loop cannot execute one more time because `j` is already 4 and it needs to be within the range [0, 2].

Given this analysis, the state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time because the loop condition is not met.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`temp` is the original value of `temp` plus the character corresponding to `info[i][2]` shifted by 96 plus the character corresponding to `info[i][3]` shifted by 96, `j` is 4**
