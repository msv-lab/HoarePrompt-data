Output State: **`i` is 0, `cases` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\), `arr` is either `[1, 1]`, `[26, 1]`, or `[26, 26]` sorted, `lex` is reduced by either 2 or 52, `j` is 1, `info` now contains the list `arr`.**

The code appends the current value of `arr` to the list `info`. Since `arr` is already defined as either `[1, 1]`, `[26, 1]`, or `[26, 26]` and is sorted, it remains unchanged. The other variables (`i`, `cases`, `lex`, `j`) are not affected by this operation.
