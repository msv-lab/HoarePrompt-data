Output State: **`i` is 0, `cases` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\), `arr` is [1, 1], `lex` is an input integer with the current value being less than or equal to 52, and `j` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(1)` adds the value `1` to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` is either `[1]` or `[26]` depending on the value of `lex`. Since `lex` is less than or equal to 52, `arr` is `[1]`. After appending `1`, `arr` becomes `[1, 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
