Output State: **`i` is 0, `cases` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\), `arr` is either [1, 1, 26], [1, 26, 26], or [26, 26], `lex` is reduced by 1 or 26, `j` is 0**.

Explanation: The code appends the value `26` to the list `arr`. Depending on the initial value of `arr`, it can now be `[1, 1, 26]`, `[1, 26, 26]`, or `[26, 26]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
