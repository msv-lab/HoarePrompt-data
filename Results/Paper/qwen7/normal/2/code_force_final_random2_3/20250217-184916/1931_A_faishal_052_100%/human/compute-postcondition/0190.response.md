Output State: `temp` is 'aamo', `i` is 4, `j` is 3, `cases` must be greater than or equal to 3.

After analyzing the given loop and the provided output states, we can see that the loop runs exactly 3 times. The variable `i` increments to 5 after the loop completes its first iteration but then remains at 4 for subsequent iterations since it is not modified within the loop body. The variable `j` starts at 0 and increases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 3, at which point the loop terminates. The string `temp` concatenates characters based on the `info` array, specifically using `chr(info[i][j] + 96)` to convert numeric indices into corresponding lowercase letters ('a' for index 0, 'b' for index 1, etc.). Given that the loop runs exactly 3 times, `temp` will end up as 'aamo'. The value of `cases` remains unchanged at 3 as no modifications are made to it within the loop.
