Output State: **`cases` is an input integer, and 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 100, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 78.**

Explanation: The code `cases = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `cases`. The initial conditions for `t` and `n` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this line of code.
