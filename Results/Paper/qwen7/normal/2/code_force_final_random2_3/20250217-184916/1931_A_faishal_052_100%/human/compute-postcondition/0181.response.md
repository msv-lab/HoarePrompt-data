Based on the initial state provided:

- `temp` is initially set to 'abcdefe'.
- `i` is set to 7.
- `j` is set to 5.

The loop runs for 3 iterations as specified by the range(3). During each iteration, `temp` is updated by appending a character based on the formula `info[i][j] + 96`. However, since `info` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we can infer that the loop does not modify `temp` directly but rather updates `temp` with the same value 'abcdefe' because `j` starts from 0 and reaches 5 after 3 iterations, but the value of `temp` is not changed within the loop.

After the loop completes, `temp` remains 'abcdefe'. The variable `i` increments by 3, starting from 4, so it becomes 7, but this value is not printed.

Therefore, the `print(temp)` statement will simply print the value of `temp` which is 'abcdefe'.

Output: **abcdefe**
