Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`cases`).
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `lex`, which is the encoded value of a three-letter word.

2. **Decoding Logic:**
   - The program attempts to decode the integer `lex` into a list of three integers representing the positions of the letters in the alphabet.
   - It uses a series of `if` statements to determine the values of these positions:
     - If `lex < 28`, it sets the first position to 1 and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
     - If `lex < 52`, it sets the second position to 26 and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
     - If `lex <= 78`, it sets the third position to 26 and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
     - It then appends the remaining value of `lex` to the list.

3. **Sorting and Constructing the Word:**
   - The list of positions is sorted.
   - The program constructs the word by converting the sorted positions back to characters using `chr(info[i][j] + 96)`.

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Incorrect Decoding Logic:**
   - The logic for determining the positions is flawed. For example, if `lex` is between 28 and 51, it should set the first position to 2 and the second position to the appropriate value, not always setting the second position to 26.
   - Similarly, if `lex` is between 52 and 78, it should set the first two positions to 26 and the third position to the appropriate value, not always setting the third position to 26.

2. **Sorting and Construction:**
   - Sorting the list of positions before constructing the word is unnecessary and incorrect. The correct approach is to directly construct the word from the original positions without sorting.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly decode the integer `n` into the lexicographically smallest three-letter word, we need to:
1. Determine the possible values for each position.
2. Construct the word directly from these values.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        # Determine the possible values for each position
        pos1 = 1 if lex < 28 else 2
        pos2 = 1 if lex < 28 else (2 if lex < 52 else 26)
        pos3 = 26 if lex >= 52 else (26 if lex >= 28 else (26 - (lex - 27) % 26))
        # Construct the word
        word = ''.join(chr(pos + 96) for pos in [pos1, pos2, pos3])
        print(word)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Conclusion:

Given the issues in the original program, the provided solution does not correctly decode the integer `n` into the lexicographically smallest three-letter word. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
