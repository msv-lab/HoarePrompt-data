Output State: **`lex` is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, `arr` contains 1 and 26, `j` is 2.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `lex` is an integer. After executing `lex = lex - 1`, `lex` becomes its original value minus 1.
- The value of `arr` remains unchanged as it was already set to contain 1 and 26 regardless of the value of `lex`.
- The value of `j` remains unchanged at 2.
