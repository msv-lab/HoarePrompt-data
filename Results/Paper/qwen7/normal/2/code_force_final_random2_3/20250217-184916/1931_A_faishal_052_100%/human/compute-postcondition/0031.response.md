Output State: **`i` is 0, `cases` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\), `arr` is [1, 26], `lex` is `lex - 26`, and `j` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `lex` is decremented by 26. Since `lex` was initially an input integer with a value less than or equal to 52, after subtracting 26, `lex` will now be an integer between -26 (if `lex` was 26) and 26 (if `lex` was 52). All other variables remain unchanged.
