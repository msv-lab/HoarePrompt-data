Output State: **`j` must take on the values 0 and 1, and `lex` is greater than or equal to 52 and less than or equal to 78, `arr` contains the value 26**.

The code `arr.append(26)` adds the value 26 to the list `arr`. Since `j` and `lex` were unaffected by this operation, their conditions remain the same. Therefore, `j` still must take on the values 0 and 1, and `lex` remains greater than or equal to 52 and less than or equal to 78. The list `arr` now contains the value 26.
