Output State: **`i` is 0, `cases` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\), `arr` is [26], `lex` is an input integer with the current value being less than or equal to 78, and `j` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(26)` adds the value 26 to the list `arr`. The list `arr` was initially empty, so after appending 26, it becomes `[26]`. The values of `i`, `cases`, `lex`, and `j` remain unchanged from their initial states.
