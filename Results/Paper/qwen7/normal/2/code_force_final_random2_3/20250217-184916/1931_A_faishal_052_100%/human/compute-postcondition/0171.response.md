Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `cases`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < cases`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `temp` is the original value of `temp` plus the sum of characters corresponding to `info[i][j]` shifted by 96 for all `j` from 0 to 2*5-1.
   - `j` is 5.

Given that the loop runs 5 times and `j` is 5 at the end of the previous iteration, it means that `i` must have incremented by 1 in the previous iteration. Therefore, `i` is now 1 (assuming `i` started from 0).

Since the loop runs 5 times, `i` needs to reach 5 for the loop to complete. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be 4 (one less than the total number of iterations).

The variable `cases` remains unchanged because it is the upper limit of the loop and does not change within the loop body.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`temp` is the original value of `temp` plus the sum of characters corresponding to `info[i][j]` shifted by 96 for all `j` from 0 to 2*5-1, `i` is 4, `cases` must be 5**
