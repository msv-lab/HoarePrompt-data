Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `j` and `lex`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `j` is less than 2.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` takes on the values 0 and 1.
   - `lex` is a non-negative integer.
   - If `lex` is less than 27, `arr` contains the element 1.
   - If `lex` is between 27 (inclusive) and 52 (exclusive), `arr` contains the value 26.
   - If `lex` is 52 or greater, the state of `arr` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` can take values from 0 to 1, and the loop continues if `j < 2`, `j` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.
   - If `j` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will become 2, which means the loop will not execute again because `j` is no longer less than 2.
   - Therefore, `j` must be set to 2 to ensure the loop does not execute again.
   - The value of `lex` and the state of `arr` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head and their values are not modified within the loop head.

Based on the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is a non-negative integer, if `lex` is less than 27, `arr` contains the element 1, if `lex` is between 27 (inclusive) and 52 (exclusive), `arr` contains the value 26, if `lex` is 52 or greater, the state of `arr` remains unchanged**.
