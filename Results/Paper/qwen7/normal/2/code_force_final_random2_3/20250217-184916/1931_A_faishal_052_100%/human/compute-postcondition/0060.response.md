Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(2)`. The only variable involved here is `j`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `j`**: According to the given state before the loop, `j` is currently 1.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The `range(2)` function generates values from 0 to 1 (inclusive). Therefore, the loop will execute if `j` is either 0 or 1. Since `j` is initially 1, the loop will execute once.

4. **Adjust the state**: We need to ensure that `j` is within the range specified by `range(2)`. Given that `j` is initially 1, it satisfies the condition for the loop to execute.

5. **Consider other variables**: The other variables (`i`, `cases`, `arr`, `lex`, `info`, and `j`) are not directly involved in the loop head and their values do not affect whether the loop will execute. They can remain as they are.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j` being within the range specified by `range(2)`.

**State:**
**`i` is 1, `cases` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 100\), `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, `j` is 1, `info` now contains the list `arr`, and `j` must be 0 or 1**
