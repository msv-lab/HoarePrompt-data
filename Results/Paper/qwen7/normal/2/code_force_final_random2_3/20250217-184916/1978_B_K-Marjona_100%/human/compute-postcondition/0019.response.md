Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is set to `t - 1`, but since `t` is not used in the print statement, we can ignore it.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.

The expression to be evaluated in the print statement is:

\[ b \times k - k \times (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) \times a \]

Let's break this down:

1. **Calculate `k`:** 
   - `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`. So, `k = min(n, b - a)`.

2. **Evaluate the expression:**
   - First part: \( b \times k \)
   - Second part: \( k \times (k - 1) // 2 \), where `//` denotes integer division.
   - Third part: \( (n - k) \times a \)

Combining these parts, the expression becomes:

\[ b \times k - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a \]

Since the exact values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not specified, we can only describe the expression in terms of these variables.

Output: **b * min(n, b - a) - min(n, b - a) * (min(n, b - a) - 1) // 2 + (n - min(n, b - a)) * a**
