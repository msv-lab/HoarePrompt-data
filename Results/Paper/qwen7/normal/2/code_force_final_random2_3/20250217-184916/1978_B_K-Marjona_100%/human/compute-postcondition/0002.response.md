Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from input split by spaces, `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `min(n, b - a)` to the variable `k`. This means `k` will take the smaller value between `n` and `b - a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial state.
