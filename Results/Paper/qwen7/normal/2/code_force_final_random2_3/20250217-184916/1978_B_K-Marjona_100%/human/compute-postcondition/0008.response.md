Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers obtained from input split by spaces, `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the condition remains unchanged. If `b` is greater than `a`, the condition also remains unchanged.
