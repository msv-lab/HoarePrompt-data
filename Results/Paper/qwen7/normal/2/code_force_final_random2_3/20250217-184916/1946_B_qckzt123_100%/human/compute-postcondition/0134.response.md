Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is a constant, `t` is equal to `t * 2 % MOD`, `ans` is equal to `ans + t % MOD`, `t` is now `t % MOD`**

Explanation: The code `ans += t` adds the current value of `t` to `ans`. Since `t` is already updated to `t % MOD`, the new value of `ans` becomes `ans + t % MOD`. The values of `i`, `k`, and `t` remain unchanged.
