Output State: **`i` is 4, `t` is 32 modulo MOD, `ans` is 48 modulo MOD, `k` is an integer input from stdin, `a` is a list of integers read from stdin.**

Explanation: The code reads a line from standard input, splits it into a list of strings, and then converts each string into an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The resulting list of integers is assigned to the variable `a`. The values of `i`, `t`, `ans`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states. The variable `n` is not used in the given code snippet, so its state remains unaffected.
