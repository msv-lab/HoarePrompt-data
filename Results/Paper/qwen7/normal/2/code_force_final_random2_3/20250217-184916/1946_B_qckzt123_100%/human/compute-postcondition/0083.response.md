Output State: **`i` is 5, `k` must be greater than 5, `t` is `t % MOD`, `ans` is `ans + t`**

The code `ans += t` increments the value of `ans` by the current value of `t`. Since `t` is already defined as `t % MOD`, the value of `ans` is updated to include this modulus operation result. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
