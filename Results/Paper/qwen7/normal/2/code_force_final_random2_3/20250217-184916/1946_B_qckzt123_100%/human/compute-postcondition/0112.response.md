Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop is defined as `for x in a:`. This means that `x` is the variable being iterated over, and it takes on each element of the list `a` in sequence.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `x` is the second element of the list `a`.
   - `tmp` is the maximum value between the original `tmp` and `t`.
   - `t` is the maximum value between the original `tmp` and `t`.

3. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `x` is the second element of the list `a`, the next element in the list `a` will be the third element.
   - The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list `a`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `a` remains a non-empty list of integers (since we are iterating through the list).
   - `x` will now be the third element of the list `a`.
   - `tmp` and `t` will remain the same because they are not directly modified by the loop itself but rather updated based on the values of `x` during each iteration.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `x` is the third element of the list `a`, `tmp` is the maximum value between the original `tmp` and `t`, and `t` is the maximum value between the original `tmp` and `t`.**
