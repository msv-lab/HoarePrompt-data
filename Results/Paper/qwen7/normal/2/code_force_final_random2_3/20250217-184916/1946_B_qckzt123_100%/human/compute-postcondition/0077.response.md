Output State: **`i` is 4, `k` must be greater than 5, `t` is `t % MOD`**

Explanation: The variable `t` is updated to its value modulo `MOD`. Since the initial state only mentions that `t` is twice its original value but does not specify the exact value of `t`, the only change is that `t` is now `t % MOD`. The other variables `i` and `k` remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
