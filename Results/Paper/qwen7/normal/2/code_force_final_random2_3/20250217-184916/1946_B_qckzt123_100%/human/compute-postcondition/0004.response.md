Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `a` is a list of integers read from input.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input from standard input, splits it into a list of strings, and then converts each string to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. This list of integers is assigned to the variable `a`. The values of `T`, `MOD`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
