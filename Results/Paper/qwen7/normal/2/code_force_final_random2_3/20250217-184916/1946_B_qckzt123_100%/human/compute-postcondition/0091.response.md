Output State: `i` is equal to `k`, `k` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations the loop ran, `t` is `t % MOD` and represents the highest value that `tmp` reached during any of the loop's iterations, `ans` is the cumulative sum of `t` values calculated throughout the loop iterations, modulo `MOD`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the final value of `k`, indicating the total number of iterations completed. The variable `t` will hold the value it had after the last iteration, which is `2^(k-1) % MOD`. The variable `ans` will contain the sum of all `t` values from each iteration, also taken modulo `MOD`.
