Output State: **`i` is 6, `k` must be greater than 6, `t` is `t * 2 % MOD`, `ans` is `ans + t * 2 % MOD`**

Explanation: The variable `t` is multiplied by 2, and then taken modulo `MOD`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, `k` must still be greater than 6, and `ans` is updated to be its original value plus the new value of `t` (which is `t * 2 % MOD`).
