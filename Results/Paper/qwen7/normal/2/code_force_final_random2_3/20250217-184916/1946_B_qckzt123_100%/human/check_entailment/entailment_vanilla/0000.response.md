### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the sum of the array after performing `k` operations.
   - Each operation allows us to choose any contiguous subarray, compute its sum, and insert that sum anywhere in the array.
   - The goal is to achieve the maximum possible sum modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The key insight is that we can always choose the subarray with the highest positive sum and repeatedly add its sum to the array. This is because adding a positive sum multiple times will always increase the total sum.
   - If the array has no positive sum, the best strategy is to keep the original sum and add zeros (which do not change the sum).

3. **Algorithm Breakdown:**
   - Calculate the initial sum of the array (`s`).
   - Find the maximum prefix sum (`t`) in the array. This is the largest sum we can get from any subarray starting from the beginning.
   - The initial answer is `(s + t) % MOD`.
   - For each of the remaining `k-1` operations, double the maximum prefix sum (`t`), and add it to the answer, taking modulo \(10^9 + 7\) at each step.

4. **Implementation Analysis:**
   - The code correctly calculates the initial sum `s`.
   - It computes the maximum prefix sum `t` using a simple loop.
   - It initializes the answer as `(s + t) % MOD`.
   - It then performs the remaining `k-1` operations by doubling `t` and adding it to the answer, ensuring the result stays within the modulo.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles negative sums appropriately by resetting `tmp` to zero when it becomes negative.
   - The use of modulo arithmetic ensures the result fits within the required bounds.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations.
