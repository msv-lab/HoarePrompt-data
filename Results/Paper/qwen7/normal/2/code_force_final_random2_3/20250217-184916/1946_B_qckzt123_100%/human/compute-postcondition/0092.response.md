Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `k`, where `k` is the number of iterations the loop ran.
- `k` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations the loop ran.
- `t` is `t % MOD` and represents the highest value that `tmp` reached during any of the loop's iterations. After the loop, `t` will hold the value `2^(k-1) % MOD`.
- `ans` is the cumulative sum of `t` values calculated throughout the loop iterations, modulo `MOD`.

Given this, let's break down the values:

- `i = k`: This means `i` is the final value of `k`, indicating the total number of iterations completed.
- `t = 2^(k-1) % MOD`: This is the highest value `tmp` reached during the loop, specifically `2^(k-1) % MOD`.
- `ans` is the sum of all `t` values from each iteration, taken modulo `MOD`.

Since `t` takes the value `2^(k-1) % MOD` in the last iteration, and assuming the loop runs `k` times, the value of `t` in each iteration would be `2^0 % MOD, 2^1 % MOD, ..., 2^(k-1) % MOD`. Therefore, `ans` would be the sum of these values modulo `MOD`.

The sum of powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^(k-1)` is `2^k - 1`. When taking this sum modulo `MOD`, we get `(2^k - 1) % MOD`.

So, the final value of `ans` is `(2^k - 1) % MOD`.

Output: **(2^k - 1) % MOD**
