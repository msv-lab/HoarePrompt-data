Output State: **`i` is 6, `k` must be greater than 6, `t` is `t % MOD`, `ans` is `ans + t * 2 % MOD`**

The code `ans += t` updates the value of `ans` by adding `t` to it. Since `t` is already calculated as `t % MOD`, the updated value of `ans` becomes `ans + t * 2 % MOD`. The other variables (`i` and `k`) remain unchanged.
