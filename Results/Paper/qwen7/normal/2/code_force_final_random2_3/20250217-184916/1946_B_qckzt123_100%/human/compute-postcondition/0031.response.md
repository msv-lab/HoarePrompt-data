Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is 2, `i` must be less than `k - 1`**

Explanation: The variable `t` is multiplied by 2, so `t` becomes 2 (assuming it was initialized to 1 before this operation, which is common when using the multiplication assignment operator without an initial value). The value of `i` remains unchanged as the code snippet does not affect `i`. The condition that `i` must be less than `k - 1` is still valid.
