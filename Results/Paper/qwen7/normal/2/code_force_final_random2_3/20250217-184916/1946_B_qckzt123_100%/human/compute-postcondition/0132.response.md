Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is a constant, `t` is equal to `t * 2 % MOD`, `ans` is equal to `ans % MOD`**

Explanation: The variable `t` is multiplied by 2. Since `t` was previously equal to `t % MOD`, after multiplying by 2, `t` becomes `t * 2 % MOD`. The values of `i`, `k`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
