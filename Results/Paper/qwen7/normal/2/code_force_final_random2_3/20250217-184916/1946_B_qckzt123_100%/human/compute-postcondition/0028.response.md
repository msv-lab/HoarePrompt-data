Output State: `t` is the maximum value between `tmp` and `t` throughout all iterations, `tmp` is 0, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input, `a` is an empty list, `s` is 0.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `tmp` will be reset to 0 at the start of each new iteration within the loop. The loop processes each element in the list `a`, accumulating the sum in `tmp`. If `tmp` becomes negative, it is reset to 0. The variable `t` keeps track of the maximum value of `tmp` encountered during the loop's execution. Once all elements in `a` have been processed, `a` becomes an empty list, and `s`, which was initially the sum of all elements in `a`, will also be 0 since no elements remain to contribute to its sum.
