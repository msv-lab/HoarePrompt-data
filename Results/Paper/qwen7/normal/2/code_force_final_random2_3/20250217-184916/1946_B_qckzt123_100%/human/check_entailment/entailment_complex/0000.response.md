Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `MOD` to \(10^9 + 7\) and reads the number of test cases `T`. For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the array `a`.

2. **Sum and Maximum Subarray Sum Calculation**:
   - `s` is the sum of the array `a`.
   - `t` is calculated as the maximum subarray sum with zeros allowed. This is done using Kadane's algorithm variant where negative contributions are ignored by resetting `tmp` to 0 when `tmp` becomes negative.

3. **Modular Arithmetic Operations**:
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to \((s + t) \% MOD + MOD\) to ensure it remains non-negative.
   - A loop runs `k-1` times, doubling `t` and adding it to `ans` each time, taking modulo `MOD` to keep the result within bounds.

4. **Final Result**:
   - After the loop, `ans` holds the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

5. **Output**:
   - The final result is printed for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to be correct. The explanation provided in the annotated program also aligns with the steps performed in the code.
