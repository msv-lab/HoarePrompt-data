Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is an integer read from input, `k` is an integer read from input.**

The code reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from the standard input using `sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()`. These values are then assigned to the variables `n` and `k`, respectively. The initial value of `T` and `MOD` remains unchanged.
