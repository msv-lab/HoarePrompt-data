Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. According to the problem description, Mocha can perform operations to make all elements in the array equal to the median of any subarray. However, the program only checks the minimum of adjacent elements up to a certain point and does not perform the necessary operations to ensure all elements become equal.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
The program will output `2` because it only checks the minimum of adjacent elements, but the correct answer should be `4`. Mocha can perform the following operations:
1. Choose the interval (l, r) = (4, 5), making the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 4].
2. Choose the interval (l, r) = (3, 5), making the array [1, 2, 4, 4, 4].
3. Choose the interval (l, r) = (1, 5), making the array [4, 4, 4, 4, 4].

Thus, the maximum possible value is `4`, but the program incorrectly outputs `2`.
