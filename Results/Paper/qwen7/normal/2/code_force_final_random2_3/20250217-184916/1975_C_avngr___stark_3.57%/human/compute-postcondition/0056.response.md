Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `max` is the maximum value between the minimum of `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`, `t` is greater than 0, and `a` is a list of integers obtained from input. If the minimum value between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is greater than `max`, then `max` is updated to this minimum value.
