Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`. The initial conditions for `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
