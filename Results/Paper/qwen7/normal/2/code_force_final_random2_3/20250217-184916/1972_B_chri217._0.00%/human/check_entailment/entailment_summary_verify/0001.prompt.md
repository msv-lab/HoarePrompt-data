You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[1])
    s = data[2]
    print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    num_up = s.count('U')
    if num_up % 2 == 1:
        return 'YES'
    else:
        return 'NO'



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a string `s` consisting of 'U' and 'D' characters, representing coins facing up and down respectively. It counts the number of 'U' characters in the string. If the count of 'U' is odd, it returns 'YES', indicating that the string can be read from start to finish without ever having more 'D' than 'U'. Otherwise, it returns 'NO', indicating that such a condition cannot be met.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - The game involves a circular arrangement of coins, where each coin is either facing up ('U') or down ('D').
   - Players take turns choosing a facing-up coin, removing it, and flipping its two adjacent coins.
   - The game ends when no more facing-up coins are available, and the player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits the input into chunks.
   - It processes each test case individually, extracting `n` (number of coins) and `s` (the state of the coins).
   - The function `func_1` is called with `s`, which counts the number of 'U' characters in `s`.
   - If the count of 'U' is odd, the function returns 'YES', indicating Alice wins; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The key observation is whether the number of facing-up coins (`num_up`) is odd or even.
   - If `num_up` is odd, Alice can always force a win because she can always make a move, leaving an even number of 'U' for Bob, who will eventually face an even number of 'U' and thus lose.
   - If `num_up` is even, Bob can mirror Alice's moves, ensuring he always has a move after her, leading to his eventual win.

4. **Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies whether the initial number of 'U' is odd or even.
   - The program handles multiple test cases correctly by processing each one sequentially.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the initial number of facing-up coins. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
