Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `k` must be greater than 0, `i` will be equal to `k`, `c` and `r` will be the last integers inputted by the user during the loop's final iteration, `num` will be the sum of 2 added for each pair of inputs where `c` does not equal `r`, plus 1 for each pair where `c` equals `r`, and `m` is calculated as `n - num`.**

This means that the value of `m` is determined by subtracting the current value of `num` from `n`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
