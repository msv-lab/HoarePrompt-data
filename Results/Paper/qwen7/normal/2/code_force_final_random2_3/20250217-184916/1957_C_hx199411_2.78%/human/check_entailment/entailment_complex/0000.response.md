Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves calculating the number of different final configurations of rooks on an \(n \times n\) chessboard after \(k\) moves, where each move is mirrored by the computer unless the move is along the diagonal. The solution uses dynamic programming to compute the number of configurations for the remaining positions.

2. **Dynamic Programming Logic**: The core logic of the dynamic programming part is correct. The base cases (`dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`) are appropriate, and the recurrence relation \((dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) \mod (10^9 + 7)\) correctly accounts for the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions.

3. **Input Handling**: The input handling is correct. The program reads the number of test cases, processes each test case, and calculates the number of valid configurations based on the remaining positions.

4. **Edge Cases**: The edge cases are handled correctly:
   - If `m` (remaining positions) is 0, the output is 0.
   - If `m` is 1, the output is 1.
   - For other values of `m`, the dynamic programming approach is used to calculate the number of configurations.

5. **Modulo Operation**: The use of modulo \(10^9 + 7\) ensures that the result fits within standard integer limits and avoids overflow issues.

Given the above points, the annotated program accurately implements the solution to the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
