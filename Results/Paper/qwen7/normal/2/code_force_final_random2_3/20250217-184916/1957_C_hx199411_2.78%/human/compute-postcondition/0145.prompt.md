Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    num = 0
    for i in range(k):
        c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if c == r:
            num += 1
        else:
            num += 2
    m = n - num
    if m == 0:
        print(0)
    elif m == 1:
        print(1)
    else:
        dp = [(0) for i in range(m + 1)]
        dp[1] = 1
        dp[2] = 3
        for i in range(3, m + 1):
            dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
        print(dp[m])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 0 and 10000-1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is an integer between 0 and 2*k, `i` is `k-1`, `c` is an integer from the input split, `r` is an integer from the input split, `m` is `n - num`. If `m` is equal to 0, then no changes are made. If `m` is greater than or equal to 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is initialized to 0, `dp[1]` is set to 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and for `i` from 3 to `m`, `dp[i]` has been updated according to the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `k` is greater than 0, `i` equals `k`, `c` and `r` are the last integers inputted during the loop's final iteration, `num` is the sum of 2 added for each pair of inputs where `c` does not equal `r`, plus 1 for each pair where `c` equals `r`, and `m` is calculated as `n - num`. If `m` equals 0, the function does not change `m`. If `m` equals 1, `m` remains 1 and `dp` will be a list of length 2 where `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`. Otherwise, the loop will continue to execute until `i` exceeds `m`, and `dp` will be a list of length `m + 1` where each element is computed based on the recurrence relation \((dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) \mod (10^9 + 7)\), with specific initial values and subsequent values following the given formula.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `m`, `n`, `i`, `num`, `c`, and `r` retain their values from the precondition. If `m` is 0, then `n` equals `num`. Otherwise, `m` is `n - num`, and the list `dp` contains values from `dp[1]` to `dp[m]` where each value `dp[i]` (for `i` from 3 to `m`) is computed as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, with initial conditions `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
