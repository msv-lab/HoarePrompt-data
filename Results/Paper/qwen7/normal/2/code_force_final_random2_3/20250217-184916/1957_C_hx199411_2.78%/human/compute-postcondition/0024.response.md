Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10000-1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is either 3, 4, 5, or 6, `i` is 2, `c` is an integer from the input split, `r` is an integer from the input split, `c` and `r` are assigned the values from the input split separated by a space. If `c` equals `r`, then `num` is either 3 or 5. Otherwise, `num` is either 4 or 6.**
