Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each case involves an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by t pairs of integers (n, k) (1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, 0 ≤ k ≤ n). It then receives k moves, each represented as a pair of integers (r_i, c_i) (1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n). For each test case, it calculates the number of valid moves (where the row and column indices are either both equal or not equal) and determines the remaining count of valid positions. Based on this count, it computes a specific value using dynamic programming and returns this value modulo \(10^9 + 7\). If the remaining count is 0, it returns 0; if 1, it returns 1; otherwise, it returns the computed value.**
