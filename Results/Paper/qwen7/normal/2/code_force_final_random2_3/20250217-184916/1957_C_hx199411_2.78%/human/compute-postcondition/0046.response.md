Output State: `t` is an integer between 0 and 10000-1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is an integer between 0 and 2*k, `i` is `m`, `c` is an integer from the input split, `r` is an integer from the input split, `m` is `n - num` and must be greater than or equal to 3 and not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is initialized to 0, `dp[1]` is set to 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[i]` for `i` from 3 to `m` has been updated according to the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `m`, which is `n - num`. The `dp` list will have been filled with values up to index `m`, following the given recurrence relation. All other variables remain in their initial or previously described states.
