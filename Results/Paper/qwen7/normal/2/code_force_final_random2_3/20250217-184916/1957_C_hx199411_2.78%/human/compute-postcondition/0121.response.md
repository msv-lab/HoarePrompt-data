Output State: **`m` is `n - num`, `i` will be equal to `k`, `num` will be the sum of increments based on the condition in the loop, and `c` and `r` will be the last integers inputted during the final iteration of the loop.**

The code `m = n - num` assigns the value of `n - num` to the variable `m`. The values of `i`, `num`, `c`, and `r` remain unchanged from their previous states.
