Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10000-1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 1, `c` is an integer from the input split, `r` is an integer from the input split, `c` and `r` are assigned the values of the first and second integers from the input split respectively.**

In this code, `c` and `r` are assigned the values of the first and second integers from the input split using `map(int, input().split(' '))`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
