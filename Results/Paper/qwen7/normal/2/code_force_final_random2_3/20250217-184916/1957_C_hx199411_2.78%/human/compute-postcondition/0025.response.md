Output State: `t` is an integer between 0 and 10000-1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is an integer between 0 and 2*k, `i` is an integer between 0 and k-1, `c` is an integer from the input split, `r` is an integer from the input split.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations (i.e., `i` goes from 0 to `k-1`), the variable `num` will have been updated based on the conditions within the loop. Specifically, for each iteration of the loop, if `c` equals `r`, `num` increases by 1; otherwise, `num` increases by 2. Therefore, `num` can take any value between 0 (if `c` always equals `r`) and 2*k (if `c` never equals `r`). The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `c`, `r`) will retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop.
