Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, and `c` is not equal to `r`.**

Explanation: The variable `num` is updated by adding 2 to its current value. Since `num` was initially `i` (which is 0), after executing `num += 2`, the value of `num` becomes 2. The other variables (`k`, `c`, and `r`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
