Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 0 and 10000-1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is either 2 or 4, `i` is 1, `c` is an integer from the input split, `r` is an integer from the input split. 

Explanation: If `c` equals `r`, then `num` remains either 2 or 3. However, if `c` does not equal `r`, `num` is incremented by 2, making it 4. In both cases, the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `c`, `r`) remain unchanged.
