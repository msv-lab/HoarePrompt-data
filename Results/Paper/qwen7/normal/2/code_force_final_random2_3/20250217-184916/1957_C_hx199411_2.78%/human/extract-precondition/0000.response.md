Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n. The moves are represented as pairs of integers (r_i, c_i) for i-th move you made, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n. No two rooks share the same row or column before each move, and the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5.**
