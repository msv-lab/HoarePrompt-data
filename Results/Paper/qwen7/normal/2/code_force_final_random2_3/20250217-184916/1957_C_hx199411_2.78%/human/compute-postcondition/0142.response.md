Postcondition: **`m` is `n - num`, `i` will be equal to `k`, `num` will be the sum of increments based on the condition in the loop, and `c` and `r` will be the last integers inputted during the final iteration of the loop. If `m` equals 1, then `m` remains 1. Otherwise, the list `dp` will contain values from `dp[1]` to `dp[m]` such that each value `dp[i]` (for `i` from 3 to `m`) is computed as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, with initial conditions `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.**
