Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < k`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `k + 1`
   - `k` must be greater than 0
   - `c` is an input integer
   - `r` is an input integer
   - `num` is either `num + 1` if `c` equals `r`, or `num + 2` if `c` does not equal `r`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is `k + 1`, it means the loop has already completed all its iterations because `i` is no longer less than `k`.
   - Therefore, the loop cannot execute again because the condition `i < k` is not satisfied.

5. **State at the start of the next iteration**:
   - The only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `k`.
   - Since the loop cannot execute again, `i` remains `k + 1`.
   - `k` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0.
   - The values of `c`, `r`, and `num` remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which in this case is not possible) would be:

State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, and `num` is either `num + 1` if `c` equals `r`, or `num + 2` if `c` does not equal `r`**
