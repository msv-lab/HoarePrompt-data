Postcondition: **`beautiful_count` is 0, `case['params']` is a dictionary containing `n`, `x`, and `y`, `results` is a list containing the sum of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` for all `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` found in `freq` during the loop iterations, `freq` is a dictionary, `mod_x` is calculated as `num % x`, `mod_y` is calculated as `num % y`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, and the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in the `freq` dictionary.**
