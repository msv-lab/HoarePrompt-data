Output State: **`case` is the next dictionary in `test_cases` containing `params`, `results`, `beautiful_count`, etc.; `n` is equal to `case['params'][0]`, `x` is equal to `case['params'][1]`, and `y` is equal to `case['params'][2]`; `a` is assigned the value of `case['array']`; `freq` is an empty dictionary.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty dictionary named `freq`. This does not affect the values of `case`, `n`, `x`, `y`, or `a`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous values, and the new variable `freq` is introduced as an empty dictionary.
