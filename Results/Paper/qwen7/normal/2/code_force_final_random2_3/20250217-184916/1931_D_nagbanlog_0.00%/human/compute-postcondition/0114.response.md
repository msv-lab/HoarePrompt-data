Based on the initial state provided:

- `beautiful_count` is 0.
- `case` is the next dictionary in `test_cases` containing `params`, `results`, `beautiful_count`, etc.
- `n` is equal to `case['params'][0]`.
- `x` is equal to `case['params'][1]`.
- `y` is equal to `case['params'][2]`.
- `a` is assigned the value of `case['array']`.
- `freq` is an empty dictionary.
- `num` is the first element of `a`.
- `mod_x` is `num % x`.
- `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`.

Let's break down the print statement step by step:

1. `num` is the first element of `a`.
2. `mod_x` is `num % x`.
3. `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.
4. `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`.

Since `mod_y` is not defined in the initial state, it must be a variable or a value that is not explicitly provided. Therefore, we can only describe `mod_y` in terms of its relationship to `num` and `x`.

Given these steps, the print statement will output:

Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [mod_y]** 

Where:
- `[num]` is the first element of `a`.
- `[mod_x]` is `num % x`.
- `[required_mod_x]` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- `[mod_y]` is equal to `mod_y`.
