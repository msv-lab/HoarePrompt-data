Output State: **`num` is the next element in the list `a`; `mod_x` is `num % x`; `beautiful_count` is unchanged; `freq` remains unchanged; `mod_y` is `num % y`.**

Explanation: The code `mod_y = num % y` assigns the remainder of `num` divided by `y` to the variable `mod_y`. The other variables (`num`, `mod_x`, `beautiful_count`, and `freq`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
