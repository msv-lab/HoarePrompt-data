Postcondition: `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in the `freq` dictionary. Otherwise, the postcondition remains unchanged, meaning `beautiful_count` is not incremented, and the other variables (`case['params']`, `results`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_y`) retain their values as described in the precondition.
