Output State: **`case` is now `case['params']`, `n` is an integer from `case['params']`, `x` is an integer from `case['params']`, `y` is an integer from `case['params']`, `results` is a list containing the sum of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` for all `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` found in `freq` during the loop iterations, `freq` is a dictionary containing counts for all unique pairs `(mod_x, mod_y)` seen throughout the iterations of the loop, `a` is updated to be `case['array']`, and `test_cases` still contains at least one element.**

In this output state, the variable `a` is updated to hold the value of `case['array']`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions as described in the initial state.
