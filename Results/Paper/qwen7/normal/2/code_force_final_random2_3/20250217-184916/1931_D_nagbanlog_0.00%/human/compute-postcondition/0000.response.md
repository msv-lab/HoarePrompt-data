Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each test case in test_cases is a list containing three integers n, x, and y such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= x, y <= 10^9; and each test case also includes a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `results`. The precondition regarding the variables `t` and `test_cases` remains unchanged.
