Output State: **`num` is the next element in the list `a`, `mod_x` is `(x - (num % x)) % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `beautiful_count` is unchanged, `freq[(x - (num % x)) % x, mod_y]` is increased by 1, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`**.

Explanation: The line `required_mod_y = mod_y` assigns the current value of `mod_y` to `required_mod_y`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `beautiful_count`, and `freq[(x - (num % x)) % x, mod_y]` remain unchanged from their initial states, while `required_mod_y` is now equal to `mod_y`.
