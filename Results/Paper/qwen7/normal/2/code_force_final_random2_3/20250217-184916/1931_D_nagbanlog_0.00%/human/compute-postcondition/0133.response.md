Postcondition: **`num` is the next element in the list `a`; `mod_x` is `(x - (num % x)) % x`; `mod_y` is `num % y`; `required_mod_y` is `num % y`; `beautiful_count` is increased by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is found in `freq`, otherwise `beautiful_count` remains unchanged; `freq` remains unchanged.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` is found in `freq`, the `beautiful_count` is adjusted based on the presence of `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` in `freq`, while `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_y`, `freq`, and `num` retain their respective states as described in the precondition.
