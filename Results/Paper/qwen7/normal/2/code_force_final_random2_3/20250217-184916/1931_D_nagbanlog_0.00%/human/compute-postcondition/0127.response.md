Output State: **`num` is the next element in the list `a`; `mod_x` is `(x - (num % x)) % x`; `beautiful_count` is unchanged; `freq` remains unchanged; `mod_y` is `num % y`; `required_mod_y` is `num % y`.**

Explanation: The line `required_mod_y = mod_y` assigns the current value of `mod_y` to `required_mod_y`. Since `mod_y` is defined as `num % y`, `required_mod_y` will also be `num % y`. The other variables (`num`, `mod_x`, `beautiful_count`, `freq`) remain unchanged.
