Output State: **`a` is not empty, `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is found in `freq`, otherwise it remains unchanged; `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1; `num` is the next element in the list `a`; `mod_x` is equal to `num % x`; `mod_y` is equal to `num % y`; `required_mod_x` is equal to `(x - mod_x) % x`; `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`; `mod_x` is updated to `num % x`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mod_x` to be `num % x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
