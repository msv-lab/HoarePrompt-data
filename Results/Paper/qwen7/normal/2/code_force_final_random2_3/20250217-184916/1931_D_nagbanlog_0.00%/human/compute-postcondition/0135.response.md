Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `num` and `a`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - `num` is the next element in the list `a`.
   - The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`.

3. **Determine the state changes**:
   - At the end of each iteration, `num` will be set to the next element in the list `a`.
   - The list `a` itself does not change within the loop.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `num` is set to the next element in the list `a`, it will be the next element in the list for the next iteration.
   - The list `a` remains the same for the next iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `num` is the next element in the list `a`.
- `mod_x` is \((x - (num \% x)) \% x\).
- `mod_y` is \(num \% y\).
- `required_mod_y` is \(num \% y\).
- `beautiful_count` is increased by 1 if \((mod_x, mod_y)\) is found in `freq`, otherwise `beautiful_count` remains unchanged.
- `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is increased by 1.

For the next iteration:
- `num` will be the next element in the list `a`.
- `mod_x` will be updated based on the new value of `num`.
- `mod_y` will be updated based on the new value of `num`.
- `beautiful_count` and `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` will remain unchanged unless the new \((mod_x, mod_y)\) pair is found in `freq`.

Therefore, the state to be adjusted for the next iteration is:
State: **`num` is the next element in the list `a`, `mod_x` is \((x - (num \% x)) \% x\), `mod_y` is \(num \% y\), `beautiful_count` is increased by 1 if \((mod_x, mod_y)\) is found in `freq`, otherwise `beautiful_count` remains unchanged, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is increased by 1**.
