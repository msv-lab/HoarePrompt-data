You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; each test case in test_cases is a list containing three integers n, x, and y such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= x, y <= 10^9; and each test case also includes a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        n, x, y = case['params']
        
        a = case['array']
        
        freq = {}
        
        beautiful_count = 0
        
        print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
        
        for num in a:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
            required_mod_y = mod_y
            print(
                f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
                )
            if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
                beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
            if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
                freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0
            freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1
        
        print(f'Beautiful pairs count: {beautiful_count}')
        
        results.append(beautiful_count)
        
    #State: Output State: `results` is a list containing the total count of beautiful pairs for all test cases processed. For each test case, `beautiful_count` is calculated based on the frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs in the `freq` dictionary. Specifically, `beautiful_count` accumulates the count of pairs `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` that exist in `freq`. The `freq` dictionary tracks the occurrences of each unique `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair across all numbers in the arrays provided by the test cases. After all iterations of the loop, `results` will contain the final `beautiful_count` for each test case, representing the total number of beautiful pairs found across all test cases.
    return results
    #The program returns a list named `results` which contains the total count of beautiful pairs for all test cases processed. Each element in the list represents the `beautiful_count` for a specific test case, calculated based on the frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs in the `freq` dictionary. The `beautiful_count` for each test case accumulates the count of pairs `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` that exist in `freq`, representing the total number of beautiful pairs found across all test cases for that particular test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, and `test_cases`, a list of test cases. Each test case is a list containing three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. Based on these inputs, the function returns a list named `results` containing the total count of beautiful pairs for all test cases. For each test case, the count of beautiful pairs is determined by the frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs in a `freq` dictionary, and the results list accumulates these counts for each test case.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list named `results` which contains the total count of beautiful pairs for all test cases processed. Each element in the list represents the `beautiful_count` for a specific test case, calculated based on the frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs in the `freq` dictionary. The `beautiful_count` for each test case accumulates the count of pairs `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` that exist in `freq`, representing the total number of beautiful pairs found across all test cases for that particular test case.
