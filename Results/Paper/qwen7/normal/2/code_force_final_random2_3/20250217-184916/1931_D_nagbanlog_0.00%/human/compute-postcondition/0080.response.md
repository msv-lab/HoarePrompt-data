Output State: **`beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_y]`, `case['params']` is a dictionary containing `n`, `x`, and `y`, `results` is a list containing the sum of `freq[required_mod_x, required_y]` for all `(required_mod_x, required_y)` found in `freq` during the loop iterations, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `mod_x` is updated to `(x - num % x) % x`, `mod_y` retains its original value, `required_mod_y` is now equal to `mod_y`, `mod_y` is updated to `num % y`.**

This means that the `beautiful_count` has been incremented by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_y]`, which was previously updated in the loop. The `mod_x` and `mod_y` values have been updated according to their respective formulas, and `required_mod_y` has been set to the current value of `mod_y`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
