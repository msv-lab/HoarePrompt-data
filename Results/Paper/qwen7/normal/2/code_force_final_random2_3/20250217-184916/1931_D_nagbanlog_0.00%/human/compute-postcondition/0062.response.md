Output State: **`beautiful_count` is 0, `case['params']` is a dictionary containing `n`, `x`, and `y`, `results` is a list containing the sum of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` for all `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` found in `freq` during the loop iterations, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `mod_x` is calculated as `num % x`, `mod_y` is calculated as `num % y`**.

In this step, the code calculates `mod_y` as `num % y`. The values of `beautiful_count`, `case['params']`, `results`, `freq`, `mod_x`, and `num` remain unchanged from the initial state.
