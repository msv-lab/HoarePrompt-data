Output State: **`a` is not empty, `mod_x` is `num % x`**

The code calculates the modulus of `num` and `x` and assigns the result to `mod_x`. Since the initial values of `num` and `x` are not specified, `mod_x` is expressed as `num % x`. The state of `a` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
