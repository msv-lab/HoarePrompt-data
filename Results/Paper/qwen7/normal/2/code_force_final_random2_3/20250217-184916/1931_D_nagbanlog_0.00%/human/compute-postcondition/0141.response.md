Output State: **`num` is the next element in the list `a`, `mod_x` is `(x - (num % x)) % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `beautiful_count` is increased by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, `freq[(x - (num % x)) % x, mod_y]` is increased by 1, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`**.

Explanation: The line `beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` increases the value of `beautiful_count` by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. The values of `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `freq[(x - (num % x)) % x, mod_y]`, and `required_mod_y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
