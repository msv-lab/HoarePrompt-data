Output State: **`beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in the `freq` dictionary; `case['params']` is a dictionary containing `n`, `x`, and `y`; `results` is a list containing the sum of `freq[required_mod_x, required_y]` for all `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` found in `freq` during the loop iterations; `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1; `mod_x` is updated to `num % x`; `mod_y` retains its original value; `required_mod_y` retains its original value; `num` is the next element in the list `a`.**

This means that the value of `mod_x` is now updated to the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`. All other variables retain their previous values or conditions.
