Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `case`, which iterates over the `test_cases` list.

2. **Determine the initial state of `case`**: Since the loop is about to start, `case` will take on the value of the first element in `test_cases`.

3. **Adjust the states based on the loop head**:
   - The variable `case` will hold one of the elements from `test_cases` during each iteration.
   - Each element in `test_cases` is a list containing three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the initial state of `case` is set correctly for the loop to execute. Specifically, `case` should be the first element of `test_cases`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
- **`results`**: This is an empty list and does not affect the loop's execution directly. It remains as is.
- **`t`**: This variable is not used in the loop head and does not affect the loop's execution directly. It remains as is.
- **`test_cases`**: We need to ensure that `test_cases` is a non-empty list because the loop will iterate over its elements. Additionally, each element in `test_cases` must be a valid list with the required structure.

### Final State:
State: **`results` is an empty list, `test_cases` is a non-empty list where each element is a list of the form [n, x, y, [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]], and `case` is the first element of `test_cases`**.

This ensures that the loop can execute as expected.
