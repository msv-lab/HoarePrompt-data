Output State: **`beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_y]` if the key `(required_mod_x, required_y)` is in the `freq` dictionary; `case['params']` is a dictionary containing `n`, `x`, and `y`; `results` is a list containing the sum of `freq[required_mod_x, required_y]` for all `(required_mod_x, required_y)` found in `freq` during the loop iterations; `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1; `mod_x` is updated to `(x - num % x) % x`; `mod_y` retains its original value; `required_mod_y` retains its original value; `mod_y` is updated to `num % y`.**

Explanation:
- `required_mod_x` is updated to `(x - mod_x) % x`. This means that `mod_x` is first taken modulo `x`, and then the difference between `x` and this value is taken, followed by taking this difference modulo `x` again.
- All other variables retain their original values or follow the same logic as described in the initial state, except for `mod_x` which is now updated to `(x - num % x) % x`.
