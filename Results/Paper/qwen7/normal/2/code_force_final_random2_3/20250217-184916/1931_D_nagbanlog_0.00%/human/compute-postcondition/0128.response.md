Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `num` is the next element in the list `a`.
   - `mod_x` is calculated as `(x - (num % x)) % x`.
   - `beautiful_count` is unchanged.
   - `freq` remains unchanged.
   - `mod_y` is `num % y`.
   - `required_mod_y` is `num % y`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(
       f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
   )
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `num` is the next element in the list `a`.
- `mod_x` is calculated as `(x - (num % x)) % x`.
- `mod_y` is `num % y`.
- `required_mod_y` is also `num % y`.

The values of `beautiful_count` and `freq` are not needed for the print statement since they are unchanged and not referenced in the print statement.

Therefore, the print statement will output the following:
- `Number: num` where `num` is the next element in the list `a`.
- `mod_x: mod_x` where `mod_x` is `(x - (num % x)) % x`.
- `mod_y: mod_y` where `mod_y` is `num % y`.
- `required_mod_x: required_mod_x` is not defined in the initial state, so it should be considered as undefined or not applicable in this context.
- `required_mod_y: required_mod_y` where `required_mod_y` is `num % y`.

Given the above, the output will be:

Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: [(x - (num % x)) % x], mod_y: [num % y], required_mod_x: [undefined], required_mod_y: [num % y]**
