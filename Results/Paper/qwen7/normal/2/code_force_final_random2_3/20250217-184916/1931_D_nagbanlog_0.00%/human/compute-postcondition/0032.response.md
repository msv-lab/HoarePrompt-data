Postcondition: `a` is not empty, `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is found in `freq`, otherwise `beautiful_count` remains unchanged; `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1; `num` is the next element in the list `a`; `mod_x` is equal to `num % x`; `mod_y` is equal to `num % y`; `required_mod_x` is equal to `(x - mod_x) % x`; `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`; `beautiful_count` is updated by adding `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` to its current value if the condition `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq` is true, otherwise `beautiful_count` remains unchanged and `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1.
