Output State: **`a` is not empty, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `required_mod_x` based on the existing value of `mod_x` and the value of `x`. It does not affect the values of `a`, `mod_x`, or `mod_y`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and the new variable `required_mod_x` is assigned the value `(x - mod_x) % x`.
