Output State: **The `results` list will contain 'no' repeated `t` times.**

Natural Language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the `results` list will consist of 'no' repeated `t` times. This means that the loop always appends 'no' to the `results` list in each iteration, regardless of the values of `start`, `end`, `i`, `n`, and `arr`. The values of `start`, `end`, `i`, `n`, and `arr` will reflect their state after the last iteration of the loop.
