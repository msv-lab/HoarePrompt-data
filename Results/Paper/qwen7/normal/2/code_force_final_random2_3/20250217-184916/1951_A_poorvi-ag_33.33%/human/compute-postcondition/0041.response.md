Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, `n` is the integer value of the user's input, `arr` is the string value entered by the user, and `results` list is ['no', 'yes'] if the count of '1' in `arr` is not exactly 2 or '11' is not a substring of `arr`, and ['no', 'no'] if the count of '1' in `arr` is exactly 2 and '11' is a substring of `arr'], `results` is now `['no', 'yes']` because 'no' was appended to it.**

In this state, the `results` list has been updated to include 'no' at its second position, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
