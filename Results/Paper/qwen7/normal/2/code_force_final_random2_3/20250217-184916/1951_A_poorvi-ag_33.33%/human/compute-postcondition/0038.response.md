Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are known:
   - `start` is an integer
   - `end` is an integer
   - `t` must be greater than or equal to 1
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is the integer value of the user's input
   - `arr` is the string value entered by the user
   - `results` list is either `['no', 'yes']` or `['no', 'no']` based on the conditions mentioned.

3. **Check the loop condition**: The loop condition is `for i in range(t)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i < t`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged because it is determined by the user's input and does not change within the loop.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `total` is not mentioned in the loop head, so it remains unchanged.
   - `i` changes from 2 to 3.
   - `t` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

6. **Final state**: The updated state for the next iteration should reflect these changes.

Therefore, the final state for the next iteration is:
State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, `n` is the integer value of the user's input, `arr` is the string value entered by the user, and `results` list is ['no', 'yes'] if the count of '1' in `arr` is not exactly 2 or '11' is not a substring of `arr`, and ['no', 'no'] if the count of '1' in `arr` is exactly 2 and '11' is a substring of `arr`.**
