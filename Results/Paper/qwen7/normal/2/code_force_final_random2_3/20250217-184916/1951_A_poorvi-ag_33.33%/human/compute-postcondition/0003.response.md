Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the user's input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The values of `start`, `end`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
