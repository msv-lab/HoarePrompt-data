Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the value entered by the user as a string, the results list contains 'no', the count of '1' in `arr` is exactly 2, and '11' is a substring of `arr`.**

Explanation: The line `results.append('no')` adds the string `'no'` to the `results` list. Since the initial state already mentioned that `results` contains `'no'` and no other changes were made to the variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state with the additional information that the count of '1' in `arr` is exactly 2 and '11' is a substring of `arr`.
