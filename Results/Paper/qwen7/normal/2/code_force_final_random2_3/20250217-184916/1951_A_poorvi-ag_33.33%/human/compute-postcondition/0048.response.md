Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, `n` is the integer value of the user's input, `arr` is the string value entered by the user, `results` is ['no', 'no'], and 'no' is appended to the `results` list.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'no'` to the list `results`. Since the initial state of `results` is `['no', 'no']`, after appending `'no'`, the list becomes `['no', 'no', 'no']`. However, the problem statement specifies that if the condition `arr.count('1') == 2 and '11' in arr` is true, `results` remains `['no', 'yes']`. Otherwise, `results` remains unchanged as `['no', 'no']`. Since the condition is not specified to be true, `results` remains `['no', 'no']`.
