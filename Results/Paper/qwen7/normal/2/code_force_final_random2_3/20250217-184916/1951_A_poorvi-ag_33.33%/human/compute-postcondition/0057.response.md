Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `r` and the list `results`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in the list `results`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `r` is the next element in the list `results`.
   - `results` is the list without the current element `r`.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `r` was the next element in the list `results` at the end of the previous iteration, removing `r` from `results` means `results` now has one less element.
   - For the loop to execute again, `results` must still contain at least one element.

5. **Updating the State**:
   - `r` will be the next element in the updated `results` list.
   - `results` will be the list without the current `r`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `r` will be the next element in the updated `results` list.
- `results` will be the list without the current `r`.

Since `results` had one less element at the end of the previous iteration, it must still have at least one element for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`r` is the next element in the list `results`, `results` is the list without the current element `r`**
