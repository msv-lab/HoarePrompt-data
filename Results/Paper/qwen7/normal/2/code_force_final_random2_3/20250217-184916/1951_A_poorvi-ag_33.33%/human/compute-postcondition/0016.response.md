Postcondition: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the value entered by the user as a string, and the results list contains 'no' if the count of '1' in `arr` is even. Additionally, either the count of '1' in `arr` is not equal to 2 or '11' is not in `arr`.
