Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the value entered by the user as a string, `results` is a list containing 'no'**.

The code appends the string 'no' to the list `results`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
