Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `n` is the integer value of the input provided by the user, `arr` is the string value entered by the user, and `results` list contains 'yes' if the count of '1' in `arr` is exactly 2 and '11' is a substring of `arr`, and 'no' otherwise.**

Explanation: The code `arr = input()` takes a string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
