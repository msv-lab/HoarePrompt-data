Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `n` is the integer value of the user's input, `arr` is the string value entered by the user, `results` list is ['no', 'yes'] if the count of '1' in `arr` is not exactly 2 or '11' is not a substring of `arr`.**

Explanation: The line `results.append('yes')` adds the string `'yes'` to the list `results`. Since the initial state of `results` was `['no']`, after appending `'yes'`, the list becomes `['no', 'yes']`. All other variables remain unchanged.
