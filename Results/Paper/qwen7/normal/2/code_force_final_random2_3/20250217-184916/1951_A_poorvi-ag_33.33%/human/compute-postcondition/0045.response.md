Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, `n` is the integer value of the user's input, `arr` is the string value entered by the user, `results` is ['no', 'no']**.

Explanation: The code snippet `results.append('yes')` appends the string `'yes'` to the list `results`. However, the condition `arr.count('1') == 2 and '11' in arr` was not specified to be true in the initial state. Therefore, the list `results` remains unchanged as `['no', 'no']`. All other variables retain their initial states.
