Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the value entered by the user as a string.**

The code `arr = input()` assigns the value entered by the user as a string to the variable `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
