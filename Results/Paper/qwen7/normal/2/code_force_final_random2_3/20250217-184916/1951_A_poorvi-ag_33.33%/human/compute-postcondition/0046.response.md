Postcondition: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, `n` is the integer value of the user's input, `arr` is the string value entered by the user, and `results` is a list that remains unchanged as ['no', 'no'] unless the condition `arr.count('1') == 2 and '11' in arr` is true, in which case `results` remains ['no', 'yes'].
