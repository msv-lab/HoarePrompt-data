The function calculates and prints the count of pairs (x, y) such that \(1 \leq x, y\) and \( (x + y) \cdot x \leq n \) and \( (x + y) \cdot y \leq m \), where \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \). The function reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\) from input, and iterates over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) to find valid pairs, incrementing a counter for each valid pair found. The function finally prints the total count of such pairs.
