You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, and n and m are within the limits specified in the problem description.
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        
        x += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `x` is 5, `n` must be at least 64, `m` must be at least 80, `cnt` is 0, `y` is 5.
    #
    #To understand this output state, let's break down the loop and its conditions:
    #
    #1. The loop continues as long as `x * x <= n`.
    #2. For each value of `x`, it initializes `y` to 1 and checks the condition `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.
    #3. If both conditions are met and `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, it increments `cnt` by the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`.
    #4. It then increments `y` until the second condition fails.
    #5. Finally, it increments `x` and repeats the process.
    #
    #From the given information:
    #- After the first iteration (`x = 2`), `cnt` is 10.
    #- After the second iteration (`x = 3`), `cnt` is 6.
    #- After the third iteration (`x = 4`), `cnt` is 1.
    #
    #Since `cnt` decreases with each additional iteration, and the loop continues as long as `x * x <= n`, we can infer that `n` must be large enough to allow `x` to reach 5 before the condition `x * x > n` becomes true. Given the pattern, `m` must also be large enough to accommodate the increasing values of `x` and `y`.
    #
    #By the fourth iteration (`x = 5`), the loop will stop because `5 * 5 = 25` which is less than or equal to `n`, but `6 * 6 = 36` which would exceed `n`. At this point, no further contributions to `cnt` are made since `x` has reached the limit where `x * x > n`. Therefore, `cnt` remains at 1 from the third iteration.
    print(cnt)
    #This is printed: 1
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns nothing.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
