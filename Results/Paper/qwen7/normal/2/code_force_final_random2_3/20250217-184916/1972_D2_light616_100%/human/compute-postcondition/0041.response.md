The loop condition is `x * x <= n`. The variables involved in this condition are `x` and `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the values are:
- `x` is 3
- `n` must be at least 5
- `m` must be at least 15 (this variable is not part of the loop condition and does not need to be adjusted)
- `cnt` is 6 (this variable is not part of the loop condition and does not need to be adjusted)

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check the condition `x * x <= n`:

1. The current value of `x` is 3, so `x * x` is 9.
2. For the loop to continue, `9` must be less than or equal to `n`.

Given that `n` must be at least 5, let's consider the minimum value of `n` that satisfies the condition:
- If `n` is exactly 5, then `9 > 5`, so the condition is not satisfied.
- If `n` is greater than 5, then the condition `x * x <= n` could be satisfied.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `n` must be greater than or equal to 9.

The state should be adjusted as follows:
State: **`x` is 3, `n` must be at least 9**
