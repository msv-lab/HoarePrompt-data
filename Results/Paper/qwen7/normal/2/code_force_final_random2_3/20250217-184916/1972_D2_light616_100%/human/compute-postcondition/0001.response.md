Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the initial state**: Given that `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\), the loop will definitely execute because `t` is guaranteed to be a positive integer within this range.

4. **Formulate the final state**: Since the loop will definitely execute given the constraints, no adjustments are needed for the initial state of `t`.

Therefore, the state remains as given:

**State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\)**.
