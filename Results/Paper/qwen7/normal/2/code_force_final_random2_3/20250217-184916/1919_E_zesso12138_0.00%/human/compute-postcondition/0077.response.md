Output State: The loop runs from \( j = 0 \) to \( j = 2 * n \). After all iterations, \( j \) will be \( 2 * n + 1 \), \( n \) will still be at least 1, and `dp` will be equal to `new_dp`. The `new_dp` list, which initially had 2 * `n` + 1 zeros, will have been updated such that each element `new_dp[j]` (for \( 0 \leq j \leq 2 * n \)) is the sum of all previous `dp[j]` values (where `dp[j] > 0`) modulo `MOD`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `new_dp` will contain the cumulative sums of `dp` elements, starting from the end towards the beginning, with each element updated modulo `MOD`.
