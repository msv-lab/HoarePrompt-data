Output State: The final state of `dp` will be a list of length \(2 \times n + 1\) where each element `dp[j]` (for \(0 \leq j \leq 2 \times n\)) is the sum of all previous `dp[j]` values (where `dp[j] > 0`) modulo `MOD`. This means that after all iterations of the loop, each element in `dp` will contain the cumulative sum of all positive values from the previous iterations, starting from the initial condition where `dp[n]` is set to 1 and all other elements are zero.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the `dp` list will contain the cumulative effect of all the updates made to it over the course of the loop, with each element being the sum of all previously updated positive values, taken modulo `MOD`.
