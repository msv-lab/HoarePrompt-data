Postcondition: **`j` is 2 * `n` + 1, `n` is at least 1, `dp` is equal to `new_dp`, and `new_dp` is a list of 2 * `n` + 1 zeros. If `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, then `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`. Otherwise, `new_dp` remains unchanged.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if statement. It indicates that regardless of whether the condition `dp[j] > 0` is true or false, the final state of the variables is the same: `j` is 2 * `n` + 1, `n` is at least 1, `dp` is equal to `new_dp`, and `new_dp` is a list of 2 * `n` + 1 zeros. If `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, then `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated according to the specified operation; otherwise, `new_dp` remains unchanged.
