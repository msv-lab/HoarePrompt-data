Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all its iterations includes `data` remaining unchanged, `index` being `index + 3 * (n + 3)`, `t` reduced to `t - 3`, `p` being a list of integers extracted from `data` starting at `index` and of length `n` for each iteration, `result` being the return value of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, and `results` being a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for all iterations.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `data` remains as it was initially. The `index` variable will have increased by three times the sum of `n` plus three, accounting for the increments in each iteration. The `t` variable will have decreased by the total number of iterations, which is 3 in this case. For each iteration, `p` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting at the current `index` and of length `n`. The `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, and these results are appended to the `results` list, making it contain the results from all iterations.
