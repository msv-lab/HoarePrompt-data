Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is `index + n + 1`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the substring of `data` from `index` to `index + n - 1` into integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**.

This means that the `data` and its `index` have not changed, `p` remains as the list of integers obtained from the substring, and `result` now holds the value returned by the function `func_1(n, p)`.
