Postcondition: **`password` is the substring of the original `password` starting from the third character if `char` is a digit. Otherwise, `password` is the remaining substring of the original `password` after removing the first character. `char` is the second character of the original `password`. If `char` is a digit, `digits` is updated by appending `char` to it. If `char` is a letter, `letters` contains the second character of the original `password`, and `digits` remains unchanged.**
