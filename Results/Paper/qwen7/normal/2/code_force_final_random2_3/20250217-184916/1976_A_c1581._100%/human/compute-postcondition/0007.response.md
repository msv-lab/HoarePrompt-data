Output State: **`password` is a string of length 1 <= n <= 20, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit, and the first character of `password` is a lowercase Latin letter; `letters` is a list containing the first character of `password`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `letters.append(char)` appends the first character of `password` to the list `letters`. Since `password` starts with a lowercase Latin letter, `letters` will contain exactly one element, which is that first character. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
