Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
2. For each test case, it separates the characters into two lists: one for digits and one for letters.
3. It sorts these lists.
4. It checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order and if the last digit is not greater than any letter.
5. It constructs a new password by concatenating the sorted digits and letters.
6. It compares this constructed password with the original password to ensure they match, which confirms that the original password meets all the criteria for being a strong password.

Given the logic and the steps outlined, the function `func_1` correctly verifies whether a password is strong according to the specified conditions.

Correctness: **True**
