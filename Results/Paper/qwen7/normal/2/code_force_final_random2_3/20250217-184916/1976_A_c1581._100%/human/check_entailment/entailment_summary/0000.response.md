Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to check if a password meets the specified conditions. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Separates the password into digits and letters.
   - Sorts the digits and letters individually.
   - Checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order.
   - Ensures that the last digit is not greater than any preceding letter.
   - Combines the sorted digits and letters and compares this with the original password to ensure no character has been misplaced.

2. **Main Program**:
   - Reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password and the password itself.
   - Calls `func_1` to verify the password.
   - Prints "YES" if the password is strong and "NO" otherwise.

Given the execution summary, the function `func_1` performs the necessary checks to validate the password according to the problem statement. The implementation correctly handles the sorting and comparison of digits and letters, ensuring that the password adheres to the specified rules.

Correctness: **True**
