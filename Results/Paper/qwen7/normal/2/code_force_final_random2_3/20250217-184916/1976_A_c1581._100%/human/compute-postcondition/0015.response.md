Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `char`.
   - The iterable is `password`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as there are characters left in `password`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `password` is a string of length 0 < n <= 19, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.
   - `letters` and `digits` are lists containing the first character of `password` if it is a letter or a digit respectively.
   - `char` is the first character of `password`.

4. **Determine the Next State:**
   - After processing one character from `password`, the new value of `char` will be the next character in `password`.
   - The list `letters` and `digits` will be updated based on the new value of `char`.
   - The length of `password` will decrease by one.

5. **Adjust the State:**
   - `char` will now be the second character of `password`.
   - `password` will be the remaining substring of `password` after removing the first character.
   - `letters` and `digits` will be updated accordingly.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `password` will be the remaining substring of the original `password` after removing the first character.
- `char` will be the second character of the original `password`.
- `letters` and `digits` will be updated based on the new value of `char`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`password` is a string of length 0 < n-1 <= 18, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit; `letters` and `digits` are lists containing the first character of `password` if it is a letter or a digit respectively; `char` is the second character of `password`.**
