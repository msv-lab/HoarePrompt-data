The only object in the loop head is the variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 and must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the number of children (input integer), `m` is the number of pairs of friends (input integer), `k` is the number of excursions (input integer), `friendships` is a list of lists where each inner list contains three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i` representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value respectively (input list of lists), and `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`**
