You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, m, k, friendships):
    result = 0
    for i in range(m):
        (a, b, f) = friendships[i]
        result += f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD
    return result % MOD

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        friendships = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
        result = func_1(n, m, k, friendships)
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it takes the number of children (n), the number of pairs of friends (m), the number of excursions (k), and a list of friendships. It then calls another function `func_1` with these parameters to compute a result. After processing all test cases, it prints the cumulative result of `func_1` for each test case. If any input is invalid, it returns an error message.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.
   - It iterates over each of the `m` friendships.
   - For each friendship, it calculates the contribution to the expected value by multiplying the initial friendship value `f` with the expected number of times the pair will be chosen in `k` excursions.
   - The expected number of times a specific pair is chosen in `k` excursions is given by \( \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \times k \), but the provided formula simplifies this to \( k \times (k + 1) / 2 \).
   - The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the list of friendships.
   - It calls `func_1` to compute the result and prints it.

### Verification of Correctness

1. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The formula used in `func_1` to calculate the expected value is correct. The expected number of times a specific pair is chosen in `k` excursions is indeed \( k \times (k + 1) / 2 \).
   - This formula accounts for the fact that each pair is chosen randomly and independently, and the probability of choosing a specific pair in any excursion is \( \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \).

2. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) at the end, which is necessary to handle large numbers and ensure the result fits within standard integer limits.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where there are no friendships correctly by returning 0.
   - The program also handles the case where there are multiple test cases and processes each one separately.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, we can conclude that it correctly implements the logic to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.
