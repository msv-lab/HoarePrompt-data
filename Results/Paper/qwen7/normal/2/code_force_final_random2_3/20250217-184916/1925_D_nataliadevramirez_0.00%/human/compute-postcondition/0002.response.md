Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the number of children (input integer), `m` is the number of pairs of friends (input integer), `k` is the number of excursions (input integer), and `friendships` is a list of lists where each inner list contains three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i` representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value respectively (input list of lists).**

Explanation: The code reads three integers (`n`, `m`, and `k`) from input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. It also takes a list of lists as input for `friendships` but does not modify the initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships`. Therefore, the precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged, and the other variables are updated to reflect the input values.
