Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the number of children (input integer), `m` is the number of pairs of friends (input integer), `k` is the number of excursions (input integer), `friendships` is a list of lists where each inner list contains three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i` representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value respectively (input list of lists), `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`**.

Explanation: The code calls the function `func_1` with the parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships`. The function call returns a value, which is assigned to the variable `result`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` remain unchanged from their initial states. The output state includes the updated variable `result` along with the unchanged variables from the initial state.
