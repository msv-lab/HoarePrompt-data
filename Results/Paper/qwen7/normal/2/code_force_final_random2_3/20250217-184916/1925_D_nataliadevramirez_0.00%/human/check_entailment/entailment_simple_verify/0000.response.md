### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the original assessment step-by-step.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions. Each pair of friends has a friendship value that increases by 1 for every excursion they are chosen. The key point here is to calculate the expected value considering the probability of each pair being chosen.

#### Given Program Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`:**
  - The function iterates over each friendship and adds the product of the friendship value and the sum of the first \( k \) natural numbers (which is \( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \)) to the result.
  - This calculation is incorrect because it does not account for the probability of each pair being chosen. Instead, it assumes that each pair is chosen exactly \( k \) times, which is not true since the pairs are chosen randomly and independently.

- **Function `func_2`:**
  - This function handles the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
  - The logic for reading input and processing each test case is correct.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to use the concept of expected value. For each pair of friends, the expected number of times they are chosen in \( k \) excursions is \( k \times \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \), where \( \binom{n}{2} \) is the total number of possible pairs of children. Therefore, the expected increase in friendship value for each pair of friends is \( k \times \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).

The correct formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values is:
\[ \text{Expected Value} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i \times k \times \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \]

#### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly calculate the expected value because it does not account for the probability of each pair being chosen. The original assessment is accurate in pointing out this flaw.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not properly account for the probability of each pair of friends being chosen during the excursions.
