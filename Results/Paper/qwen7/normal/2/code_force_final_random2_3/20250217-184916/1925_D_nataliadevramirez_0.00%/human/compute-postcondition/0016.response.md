Output State: `t` must be equal to or greater than the total number of test cases, `n` is the number of children (input integer), `m` is the number of pairs of friends (input integer), `k` is the number of excursions (input integer), `friendships` is a list of lists where each inner list contains three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i` representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value respectively (input list of lists), and `result` is the cumulative return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)` for all test cases.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will hold the total number of test cases provided as input. For each test case, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` are determined by the input for that specific test case. The variable `result` accumulates the results from `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)` for each test case, giving a final output that reflects the combined results of all test cases processed by the loop.
