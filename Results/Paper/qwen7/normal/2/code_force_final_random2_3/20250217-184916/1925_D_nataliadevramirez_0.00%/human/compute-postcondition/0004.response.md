Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the number of children (input integer), `m` is the number of pairs of friends (input integer), `k` is the number of excursions (input integer), `friendships` is a list of lists where each inner list contains three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i` representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value respectively (input list of lists), and `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`**.

In this case, the function `func_1` is called with the parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships`. The function returns a value which is assigned to `result`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` remain unchanged from their initial states, but now `result` holds the return value of the function call.
