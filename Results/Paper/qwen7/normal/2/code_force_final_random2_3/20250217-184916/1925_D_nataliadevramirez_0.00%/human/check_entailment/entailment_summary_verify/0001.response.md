### Reasoning

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the analysis again to confirm the correctness of the program:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates over each friendship and calculates the expected contribution to the sum of friendship values for all `k` excursions.
   - The formula used to calculate the expected number of times a specific pair is chosen in `k` excursions is \( k \times (k + 1) / 2 \). This is derived from the fact that each pair is chosen randomly and independently, and the probability of choosing a specific pair in any excursion is \( \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \).
   - Multiplying the initial friendship value `f` by \( k \times (k + 1) / 2 \) gives the expected contribution of that friendship to the total sum.
   - The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the list of friendships.
   - It calls `func_1` to compute the result and prints it.

### Verification of Correctness

1. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The formula used in `func_1` to calculate the expected value is correct. The expected number of times a specific pair is chosen in `k` excursions is indeed \( k \times (k + 1) / 2 \).
   - This formula accounts for the fact that each pair is chosen randomly and independently, and the probability of choosing a specific pair in any excursion is \( \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \).

2. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) at the end, which is necessary to handle large numbers and ensure the result fits within standard integer limits.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where there are no friendships correctly by returning 0.
   - The program also handles the case where there are multiple test cases and processes each one separately.

### Conclusion

After re-analyzing the program, we can confirm that it correctly implements the logic to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
