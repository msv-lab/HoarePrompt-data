n is an integer representing the number of children, m is an integer representing the number of pairs of friends, and k is an integer representing the number of excursions. friendships is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (a_i, b_i, f_i) representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value, respectively. Additionally, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9.
