Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for \( k \) excursions.
2. The given code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
3. `func_1` is responsible for calculating the contribution of each friendship to the expected value. It iterates through each friendship, multiplies the friendship value by the number of ways to choose 2 excursions out of \( k \) (which is \( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \)), and sums these contributions.
4. `func_2` handles reading input for multiple test cases, processes each test case by calling `func_1`, and prints the results.
5. The logic in both functions seems to correctly implement the problem statement:
   - `func_1` correctly calculates the expected value for each friendship.
   - `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results.

Given that the logic in both functions aligns with the problem requirements and the provided execution summaries, the program should be correct.

Correctness: **True**
