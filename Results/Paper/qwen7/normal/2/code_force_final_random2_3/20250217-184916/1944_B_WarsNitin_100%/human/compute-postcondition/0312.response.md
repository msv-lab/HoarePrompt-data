State: **`k` is equal to `req`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains three variables: `i`, `n`.
2. The loop condition is `range(1, n)`, which means the loop will start with `i = 1` and continue as long as `i < n`.
3. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1 because if `n` is 1 or less, the range will not generate any values for `i`.
4. The variable `k` is equal to `req`, but this does not affect the loop's execution since the loop does not reference `k` or `req` directly.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` set to 1, `n` must be greater than 1, and `k` is equal to `req`.
