Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is equal to 0, and `ans1` contains the elements `b[i - 1]` and `b[1]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the element `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. Given that `i` is 2, `b[i - 1]` is `b[1]`. Since `ans1` initially contained the element `b[i - 1]`, after executing the code, `ans1` now contains both `b[1]` and `b[2]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
