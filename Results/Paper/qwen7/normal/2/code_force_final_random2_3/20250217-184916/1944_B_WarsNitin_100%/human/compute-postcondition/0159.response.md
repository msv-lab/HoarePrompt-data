Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and the current value of `k` is 0, resulting in a break from the most internal loop or if statement, `b[i]` is added to the list `l`, and `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `b[i]` to the list `l`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is 0, and there is a break from the most internal loop or if statement. The condition that `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]` remains unchanged. Therefore, `b[1]` is added to the list `l`.
