Output State: **`b` is a sorted version of the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is sorted, `k` is 2 times the original value of `k` minus 2, `ans1` is a list containing the element `b[n - 1]`, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is the original value of `k`, `l` is a list containing `b[0]` if `b[0] != b[1]`; otherwise, `l` remains an empty list.**

Explanation: 
- The value of `k` is decremented by 2, making it `2 * req - 2`.
- All other variables (`b`, `c`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `req`, and `l`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
