Output State: **`k` is 0, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 1, `ans1` is a list containing all consecutive duplicate elements found in `b` from index 1 to `n-2`, `l` is a list containing the last unique element of `b` from index `n-2` to `n-1` if `b[n-2]` is not equal to `b[n-1]`; otherwise, `l` remains as an empty list, `ans2` is a list containing the current value of `c[i]` which is `c[3]`.**

The code appends the current value of `c[i]` to `ans2`. Given that `i` was initially 2, after executing `i += 1`, `i` becomes 3. Therefore, `ans2` now contains the value of `c[3]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
