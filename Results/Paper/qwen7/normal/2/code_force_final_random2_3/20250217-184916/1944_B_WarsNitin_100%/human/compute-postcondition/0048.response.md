Output State: **`k` is 0 and `i` is `n-1`; `ans1` now contains the element `b[i]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the element `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. The values of `k` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes the updated `ans1` list with the new element appended, while `k` and `i` retain their original values.
