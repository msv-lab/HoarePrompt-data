Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts based on space, and converts each part into integers. These integers are then assigned to `n` and `k`. Since the initial values of `n` and `k` are not specified in the initial state, they are considered as the result of the input operation. The output state reflects that `n` and `k` now hold the integer values from the input, while no other variables are affected.
