Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, and `k` is 0; `l` contains the element `b[2]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the element `b[i]` to the list `l`. Given that `i` is 2, `l` will now contain the element `b[2]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
