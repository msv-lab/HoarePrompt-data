Output State: **`k` is -2, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 4, `ans1` is a list containing all consecutive duplicate elements found in `b` from index 1 to `n-2`, `l` is a list containing the last unique element of `b` from index `n-2` to `n-1` if `b[n-2]` is not equal to `b[n-1]`; otherwise, `l` remains as an empty list, `ans2` is a list containing the current value of `c[i]` which is `c[4]` appended, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `k` equals 0; `ans2` now contains the value of `c[4]`.**

In this output state, the value of `k` and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `n` and the conditions for `ans1` and `l` also remain the same. `ans2` now includes the value of `c[4]` after appending it. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `k` equals 0, but since `k` is -2, this condition is not met.
