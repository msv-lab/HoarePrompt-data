Output State: **`i` is 1; `ans1` contains the element at index 0 of `l` appended with the element at index 1 of `l`; `ans2` contains the element at index 1 of `l` and the element at index 1 of `l` appended.**

Explanation: The code appends the element at index `i` (which is 1) of list `l` to `ans2`. Initially, `ans2` contained only the element at index 1 of `l`. After appending the element at index 1 again, `ans2` now contains the element at index 1 of `l` twice.
