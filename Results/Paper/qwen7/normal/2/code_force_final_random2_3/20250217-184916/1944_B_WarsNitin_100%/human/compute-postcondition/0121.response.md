Output State: `k` is -n, `i` is `2 * n - 1`, `ans2` contains all elements that met the condition `c[i] == c[i - 1]` for some `i` in the range (1, n-1) in pairs, and `ans1` includes all elements from `l` up to the point where the loop terminated.

Explanation: Given that the loop continues as long as `k` is greater than or equal to 0, and considering the output state after the loop executes 3 times, we can infer that `k` starts at 0 and decreases by 1 with each iteration. Therefore, after `n` iterations, `k` will be `-n`. The value of `i` increases by 1 with each iteration, starting from `n` (the initial value of `i`), so after `n` iterations, `i` will be `n + (n - 1) = 2 * n - 1`. Both `ans1` and `ans2` continue to accumulate elements from `l` based on the given conditions, resulting in `ans1` containing all elements from `l` and `ans2` containing all pairs of consecutive elements from `l` that meet the specified condition.
