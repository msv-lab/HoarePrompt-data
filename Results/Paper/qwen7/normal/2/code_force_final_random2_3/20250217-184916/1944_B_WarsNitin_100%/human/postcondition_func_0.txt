The function processes a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. It then prints two lists: the first list contains pairs of integers from the first half of the original list that meet certain conditions, and the second list contains pairs of consecutive equal elements from the second half of the original list. The function handles multiple test cases specified by the variable `t`.
