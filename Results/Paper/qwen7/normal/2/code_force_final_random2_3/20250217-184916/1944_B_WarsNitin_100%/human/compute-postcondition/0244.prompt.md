Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `k` is -2 * (n-1), `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than 1, `ans1` is a list containing all consecutive duplicate elements found in `b` from index 1 to `n-2`, `l` is a list containing the last unique element of `b` from index `n-2` to `n-1` if `b[n-2]` is not equal to `b[n-1]`; otherwise, `l` remains as an empty list, `ans2` is a list containing all values of `c[i]` for each iteration where `c[i]` was equal to `c[i-1]`.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. For each iteration, if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i-1]`, `k` is decremented by 2 and the value of `c[i]` is appended twice to `ans2`. The loop continues until `k` becomes 0 or the loop reaches `i = n-1`. After all iterations, `k` will be `-2 * (n-1)` because it starts at 0 and is decremented by 2 for each pair of consecutive duplicates. The variable `i` will be `n` because the loop increments `i` on each iteration and stops when `i` reaches `n`. The other variables (`ans1`, `l`, `c`) remain unchanged unless they were modified outside the loop, but based on the given information, they do not change.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(l)):
    if k == 0:
        break
    ans1.append(l[i])
    ans2.append(l[i])
    k -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1, `ans1` includes the element at index 0 of `l`, `ans2` includes the element at index 1 of `l`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1; `ans1` includes the element at index 0 of `l`; `ans1` is updated by appending the element at index 2 of `l`; `ans2` includes the element at index 1 of `l`; `ans2` now includes the element at index 1 of `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 1; `ans1` includes the elements at indices 0 and 2 of `l` and appends the element at index 2 of `l`; `ans2` includes the element at index 1 of `l` and the element at index `i` of `l`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
