Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, and `k` is -2; `ans1` has the element `b[3]` and `b[3]` appended to it.**

The value of `k` is decremented by 2, changing its value from 0 to -2. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. The state of `ans1` and the list `b` also remain unaffected by the code.
