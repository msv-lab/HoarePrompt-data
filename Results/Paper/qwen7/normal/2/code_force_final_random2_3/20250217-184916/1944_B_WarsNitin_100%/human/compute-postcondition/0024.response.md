Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is either twice the original value of `k` or `k` minus 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `b` is a sublist of `a` containing the first `n` sorted elements, `c` is a sublist of `a` containing the remaining elements after the first `n` elements, `c` is sorted, `ans1` is a list containing the first element of `b`, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing the first and last elements of `b` if the first two elements of `b` are unequal, otherwise `l` is a list containing the first element of `b` repeated twice.
