Output State: **`k` is -4, `i` is 5, `n` is greater than 4, `ans1` is a list containing all consecutive duplicate elements found in `b` from index 1 to `n-2`, `l` is a list containing the last unique element of `b` from index `n-2` to `n-1` if `b[n-2]` is not equal to `b[n-1]`; otherwise, `l` remains as an empty list, `ans2` now contains the value of `c[5]`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the value of `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. Given that `i` is 5, `ans2` now contains the value of `c[5]`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
