Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is equal to `2 * n - 1`, `k` is `-n`, `ans1` contains all elements from `l`, and `ans2` contains pairs of consecutive equal elements from the list `c` starting from index 1 up to `n-1` unless `k` becomes 0 before reaching the end of the list.

Explanation: Since the loop runs `t` times, and `t` is initially set to the value of `n`, the loop will run `n` times. As described, `k` decreases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `-n` after `n` iterations. The variable `i` starts at `n` and increments by 1 with each iteration, so after `n` iterations, `i` will be `2 * n - 1`. During these iterations, `ans1` collects all elements from `l`, and `ans2` collects pairs of consecutive equal elements from `c` starting from index 1 up to `n-1`, provided that `k` remains non-negative. If `k` becomes 0 before reaching the end of the list, the collection process for `ans2` will stop early.
