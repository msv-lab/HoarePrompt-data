Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` equals 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `ans1` contains the element `l[1]`, `ans2` contains the element `l[1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the element `l[i]` to the list `ans2`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `ans2` will contain `l[1]`. The other variables (`i`, `k`, and `ans1`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
