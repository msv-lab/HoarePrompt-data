Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, and `k` is 0; `ans1` contains the element `b[2]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the element `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. Given that `i` is 2, the element `b[2]` is appended to `ans1`. The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, and the initial condition of `ans1` (which had `b[2]` appended to it) remain unchanged.
