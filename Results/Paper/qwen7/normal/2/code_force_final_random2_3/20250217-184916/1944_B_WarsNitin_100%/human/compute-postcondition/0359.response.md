Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is 0.
   - `ans1` contains the element at index 0 of `l` appended with the element at index 1 of `l`.
   - `ans2` contains the element at index 1 of `l` and the element at index 1 of `l` appended.

2. **Loop Head**: 
   - The loop iterates over the range of the length of `l` using `i`.

3. **Conditions for Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(l)`.
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` would be 1.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - The variable `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - We need to check the conditions for `ans1` and `ans2` based on the new value of `i`.

5. **Updating `ans1` and `ans2`**:
   - `ans1` currently contains the elements from index 0 and 1 of `l`.
   - `ans2` currently contains the elements from index 1 and 1 of `l`.

Since the loop will now proceed to the next iteration with `i` set to 1, we need to ensure that `ans1` and `ans2` reflect the correct values for this new iteration.

- `ans1` will now contain the elements from index 1 and 2 of `l`.
- `ans2` will now contain the elements from index 2 and 2 of `l`.

However, since the problem only asks us to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, we focus on `i`.

Therefore, the state adjustments are as follows:

State: **`i` is 1**
