Output State: **`k` is -2, `i` is `n + 2`, `ans2` contains all elements that met the condition `c[i] == c[i - 1]` for some `i` in the range (1, n-1) in pairs, and now includes the element `l[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block that was modifying the `ans2` list. The values of `k`, `i`, and `ans2` remain unchanged because the `break` statement does not alter their values.
