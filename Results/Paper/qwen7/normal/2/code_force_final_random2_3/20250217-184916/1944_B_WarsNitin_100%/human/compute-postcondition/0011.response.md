Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is twice the original value of `k`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `b` is a sublist of `a` containing the first `n` sorted elements, `c` is a sublist of `a` containing the remaining elements after the first `n` elements, `c` is sorted, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is equal to `k`.**

The code `req = k` simply assigns the value of `k` to `req`. No other variables are affected, and the conditions and values of the other variables remain the same as the initial state.
