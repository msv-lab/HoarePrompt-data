Output State: **`b` is a sorted version of the first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is sorted, `k` is 2 times the original value of `k`, `ans1` is a list containing the element `b[n - 1]`, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is the original value of `k`, `l` is a list containing `b[0]` if `b[0] != b[1]`; otherwise, `l` remains an empty list.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends `b[n - 1]` to `ans1`. Since `b` is a sorted version of the first `n` elements of `a`, the last element of `b` (which is `b[n - 1]`) is added to `ans1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
