Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is equal to 0, and `ans1` contains the element `b[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. Given that initially `i` is 1, after executing `i += 1` (implied by the condition `b[i]` referring to the next index), `i` becomes 2. Since `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, `ans1` will contain the value of `b[1]` (which is `b[i - 1]` when `i` is 2). All other variables remain unchanged.
