Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, and `k` is 0; `ans1` has the element `b[3]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the element `b[3]` to the list `ans1`. Since `i` is 3, `ans1.append(b[i])` appends `b[3]` to `ans1`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated `ans1` list and the unchanged values of `n` and `k`.
