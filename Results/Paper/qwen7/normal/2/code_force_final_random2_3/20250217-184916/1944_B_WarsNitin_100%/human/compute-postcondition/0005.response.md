Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `b` is a sublist of `a` containing the first `n` elements, `c` is a sublist of `a` containing the remaining elements after the first `n` elements.**

Explanation: The code `c = a[n:]` assigns to `c` a sublist of `a` starting from index `n` to the end of the list `a`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged.
