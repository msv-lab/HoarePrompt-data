Output State: **`k` is 0, `i` is `n`, `ans2` contains all elements that met the condition `c[i] == c[i - 1]` for some `i` in the range (1, n-1) in pairs, and `ans1` now includes the element `l[i]`, `ans2` now includes the element `l[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the element `l[i]` to the list `ans2`. The values of `k`, `i`, and `ans1` remain unchanged from their initial states. The updated state of `ans2` includes all previously existing elements plus the new element `l[i]`.
