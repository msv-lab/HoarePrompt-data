Output State: **`k` is -2 and `i` is 1; `ans1` contains the element `b[1]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is decremented by 2, changing its value from 0 to -2. The variable `i` remains unchanged at 1. Similarly, `ans1` still contains the element `b[1]` appended to it, as no operation was performed on `ans1`.
