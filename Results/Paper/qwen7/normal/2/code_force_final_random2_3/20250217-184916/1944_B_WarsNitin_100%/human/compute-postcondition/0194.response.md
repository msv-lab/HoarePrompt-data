Postcondition: `k` is assigned the value of `req`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `ans1` is a list containing all consecutive duplicate elements found in `b` from index 1 to `n-2`, `l` is a list containing the last unique element of `b` from index `n-2` to `n-1` if `b[n-2]` is not equal to `b[n-1]`; otherwise, `l` remains as an empty list, and if `k == 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
