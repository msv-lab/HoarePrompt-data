Output State: `t` is equal to 0, `n` is an integer input from stdin, `s` is the string read from stdin and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `cases` is a list containing `t` tuples: each tuple is `(n, s)`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` (which started as a positive integer) has been reduced to 0 through the loop's decrement or exhaustion process. The variable `n` and the string `s` retain their last input values from the last iteration of the loop. The list `cases` contains `t` tuples, with each tuple consisting of `n` and `s`, reflecting the inputs collected during each iteration of the loop.
