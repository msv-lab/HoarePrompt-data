Output State: `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an integer input from stdin for each iteration; `s` is the string read from stdin and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace for each iteration; `cases` is a list containing `t` tuples, each tuple is of the form `(n, s)` where `n` and `s` are the last values read from stdin during the loop's final iteration.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `cases` will contain `t` tuples, with each tuple holding the most recent `n` and `s` values read from stdin for each of the `t` test cases. The value of `t` itself will be reduced to 0 after all iterations since it starts as the number of test cases and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0.
