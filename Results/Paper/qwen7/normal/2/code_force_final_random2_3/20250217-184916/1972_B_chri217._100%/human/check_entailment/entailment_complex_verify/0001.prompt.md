You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer representing the number of coins, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and s is a string of length n consisting of only "U" and "D", where "U" represents a coin facing up and "D" represents a coin facing down.
def func_1():
    t = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
        
        s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
        
        cases.append((n, s))
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is an integer input from stdin for each iteration; `s` is the string read from stdin and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace for each iteration; `cases` is a list containing `t` tuples, each tuple is of the form `(n, s)` where `n` and `s` are the last values read from stdin during the loop's final iteration.
    #
    #This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `cases` will contain `t` tuples, with each tuple holding the most recent `n` and `s` values read from stdin for each of the `t` test cases. The value of `t` itself will be reduced to 0 after all iterations since it starts as the number of test cases and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0.
    return cases
    #The program returns a list named 'cases' which contains 't' tuples. Each tuple consists of the last values of 'n' and 's' read from stdin for each of the 't' test cases. After all iterations, 't' is reduced to 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a specified number of test cases (up to 100) where each test case involves reading an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`. These values represent the number of coins and their initial orientation (either "U" or "D"), respectively. The function collects these values into a list of tuples, with each tuple containing the last `n` and `s` values read from standard input for each test case. After processing all test cases, the variable `t`, which initially holds the number of test cases, is reduced to 0. The function returns the list of tuples.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: case is a list of length 2, where the first element is an integer representing the number of coins (n), and the second element is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D", representing the initial state of the coins (facing up or down).
def func_2(case):
    ups = sum(1 for c in case[1] if c == 'U')
    return 'YES' if ups % 2 else 'NO'
    #'YES' if the count of 'U' in the second element of 'case' is even, otherwise 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `case` containing two elements: an integer representing the number of coins and a string of length n consisting of "U" and "D". It counts the number of "U" characters in the string and returns 'YES' if this count is even, otherwise it returns 'NO'.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from standard input.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the initial state of the coins.
   - This part of the code is correct and matches the problem requirements.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The function `func_2` processes each test case.
   - It counts the number of 'U' (facing up) coins in the string `s`.
   - If the count of 'U' coins is even, it returns 'YES'.
   - If the count of 'U' coins is odd, it returns 'NO'.

3. **Game Logic:**
   - The problem states that the game ends when there are no more facing-up coins.
   - The key observation here is that each move reduces the number of facing-up coins by at least one.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even initially, Alice can always make a move that leaves an odd number of facing-up coins for Bob, and vice versa.
   - Therefore, if the number of facing-up coins is even, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position, and if it is odd, Bob can do the same.

4. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly determines the winner based on the parity (even or odd) of the number of facing-up coins.
   - This aligns with the optimal strategy described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the initial number of facing-up coins. The function `func_2` accurately reflects the game's outcome for each test case.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
