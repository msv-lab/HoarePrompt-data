Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` is an integer input from stdin, `s` is the string read from stdin and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `cases` is a list containing two tuples: the first tuple is `(t-1, <initial value of s>)` and the second tuple is `(n, s)`**.

Explanation: The code reads an integer from standard input and assigns it to `n`. The value of `t` is decreased by 1, but the exact value of `t` is not specified, only that it is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1. The values of `s` and `cases` remain unchanged.
