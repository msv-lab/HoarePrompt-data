### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases (`t`) and then iterates `t` times to read the number of coins (`n`) and the state of the coins (`s`).
   - It stores these values in a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n` and `s`.
   - The function correctly processes all test cases and returns a list of tuples, each representing a test case.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function takes a single test case as input, which is a tuple containing `n` and `s`.
   - It calculates the number of coins facing up (`ups`) by counting the occurrences of 'U' in the string `s`.
   - It returns 'YES' if the count of 'U' is even, and 'NO' if the count is odd.
   - This logic correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of coins facing up.

3. **Main Execution**:
   - The main part of the program calls `func_1` to get the list of test cases and then iterates over each test case, calling `func_2` to determine the winner for each case.
   - The results are printed in the correct format.

Given the problem statement and the provided examples, the logic implemented in both functions is correct. The program correctly processes each test case and outputs the expected results.

### Correctness:
**True**
