Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer input from stdin, `s` is the string read from stdin and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `cases` is a list containing two tuples: the first tuple is `(t, <initial value of s>)` and the second tuple is `(n, s)`**.

This means that the list `cases` now contains two tuples: the first tuple consists of the initial value of `t` and the initial value of `s` (before any input was taken), and the second tuple consists of the input value of `n` and the input value of `s`.
