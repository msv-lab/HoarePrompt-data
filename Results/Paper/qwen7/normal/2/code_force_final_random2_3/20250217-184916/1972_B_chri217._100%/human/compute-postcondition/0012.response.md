Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` is an integer input from stdin, `s` is the string read from stdin and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `cases` is a list containing two tuples: the first tuple is `(t-1, s)` and the second tuple is `(n, s)`**

Explanation: The code reads a line from standard input, strips it of leading and trailing whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `s`. This updates the value of `s` but does not affect `t`, `n`, or the `cases` list. The `cases` list is updated to reflect the new value of `s`.
