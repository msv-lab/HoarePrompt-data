Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer input from stdin, `s` is the string read from stdin and stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, s)`**

Explanation: The code `s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()` reads a line from standard input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace. It does not modify the values of `t`, `n`, or `cases`. Therefore, the value of `t` remains greater than 0, `n` retains its value as an integer input from stdin, `s` is updated to the stripped string, and `cases` remains unchanged as a list containing the tuple `(n, s)`.
