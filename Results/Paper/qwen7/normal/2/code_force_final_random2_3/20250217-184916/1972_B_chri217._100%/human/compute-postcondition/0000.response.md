Output State: **`case` is a list of length 2, where the first element is an integer representing the number of coins (n), and the second element is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D", representing the initial state of the coins (facing up or down); `ups` is the count of 'U' in the second element of `case`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the number of 'U' characters in the second element of the `case` list and assigns this count to the variable `ups`. The first element of `case` remains unchanged, and the second element remains a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D".
