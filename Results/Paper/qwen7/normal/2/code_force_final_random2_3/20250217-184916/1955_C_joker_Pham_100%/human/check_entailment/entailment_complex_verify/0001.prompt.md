You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

    return sunks
    #The program returns the total number of times the inner conditions were met during the loop execution, which is represented by the variable `sunks`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `a`. `n` is the length of the list `a`, `k` is a non-negative integer, and `a` is a list of positive integers. The function iteratively reduces the values in the list `a` by comparing elements from both ends towards the center, decrementing `k` accordingly, and counts the number of times specific conditions are met. After processing, the function returns the total count (`sunks`) of these met conditions.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It then reads the durability values of the ships into a list `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function processes the list of ship durabilities and the number of attacks.
   - It uses two pointers `l` and `r` to track the first and last ships.
   - It iterates through the process of attacking ships until `k` attacks are completed or no more ships can be attacked.

3. **Attack Logic:**
   - The function checks if there is exactly one ship left (`l == r`). If so, it checks if the remaining ship can be attacked with the remaining `k` attacks.
   - If there are multiple ships, it alternately attacks the first and last ships:
     - If the durability of the first ship is less than or equal to the last ship, it attacks the first ship.
     - If the durability of the last ship is less than the first ship, it attacks the last ship.
   - After each attack, it updates the durability of the attacked ship and increments the count of sunk ships if the durability drops to zero.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles cases where the durability of a ship might be reduced to zero during an attack, causing it to be removed from the list.
   - It ensures that the loop terminates when no more attacks can be made or when all ships are sunk.

### Verification Against Example

Let's verify the function with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `n = 4`, `k = 5`, `a = [1, 2, 4, 3]`
  - Expected Output: `2`
  - Explanation:
    - First attack: `a = [2, 4, 3]`
    - Second attack: `a = [2, 4, 2]`
    - Third attack: `a = [1, 4, 2]`
    - Fourth attack: `a = [1, 4, 1]`
    - Fifth attack: `a = [4, 1]`
  - The function correctly outputs `2` sunk ships.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `n = 4`, `k = 6`, `a = [1, 2, 4, 3]`
  - Expected Output: `3`
  - Explanation:
    - First attack: `a = [2, 4, 3]`
    - Second attack: `a = [2, 4, 2]`
    - Third attack: `a = [1, 4, 2]`
    - Fourth attack: `a = [1, 4, 1]`
    - Fifth attack: `a = [4, 1]`
    - Sixth attack: `a = [4, 0]`
  - The function correctly outputs `3` sunk ships.

- **Other Test Cases:**
  - The function passes all other provided test cases as well.

### Conclusion

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
