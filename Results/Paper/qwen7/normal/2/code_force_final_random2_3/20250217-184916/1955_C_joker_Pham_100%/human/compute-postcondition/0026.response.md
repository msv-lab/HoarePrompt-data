Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15 and its current value is `k - 2*a[l]`; `a` is a list of positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i, and the length of `a` is equal to `n`; `l` is 1; `r` is n - 2; `sumk` is 0; `sunks` is 2; the value of `l` is equal to `r`.**

Explanation: The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Initially, `l` was set to 0. After executing the code, `l` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
