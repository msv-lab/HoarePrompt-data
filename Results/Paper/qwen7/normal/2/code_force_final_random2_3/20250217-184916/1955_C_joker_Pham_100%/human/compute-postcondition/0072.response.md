Output State: **We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect any variable values; it only causes the immediate exit from the nearest enclosing loop or conditional block. Since there are no variables defined or modified before the `break` statement, the initial state remains unchanged except for the fact that the program will break out of the loop or conditional block it was inside.
