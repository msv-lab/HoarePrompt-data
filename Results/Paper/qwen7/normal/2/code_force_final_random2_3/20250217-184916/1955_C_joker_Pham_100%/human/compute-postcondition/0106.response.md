Postcondition: `k` is an integer equal to `k - 2 * a[r] - a[l]`, `sunks` is incremented by 1, and if `k` equals 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[l]` is 0, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[r] - a[l + 1]` and `sunks` is incremented to `sunks + 1`. If `a[l]` is not 0, no changes are made to `k` and `sunks`.
