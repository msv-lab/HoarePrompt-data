Output State: **`sunks` is incremented by 1, and `l` must be less than or equal to `r`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or if statement that `k` was part of. The values of `sunks`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged, and the condition that `l` must be less than or equal to `r` is still valid.
