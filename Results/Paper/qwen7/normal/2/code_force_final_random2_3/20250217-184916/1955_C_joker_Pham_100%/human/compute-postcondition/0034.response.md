Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `a` is a list of positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i, and the length of `a` is equal to `n`; `l` is 0; `r` is n - 1; `sumk` is 0; the current value of `l` is equal to `r`; either `k` is equal to `a[l] * 2 - 1` and `sumk` is 1, or `k` is less than `a[l] * 2` and `a[l] * 2 - 1 ≠ k`.**
