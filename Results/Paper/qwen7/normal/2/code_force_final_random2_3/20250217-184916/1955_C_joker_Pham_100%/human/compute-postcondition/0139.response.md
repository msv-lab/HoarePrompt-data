Output State: **`sunks` is incremented by 1, `k` is an integer equal to `k - 2 * a[l]`, `a[r]` is decreased by `a[l]`. If `a[r]` is not zero, `r` is decremented by 1; `l` is incremented by 1. We continue the loop or iteration.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed directly to the next iteration. Since no specific action is taken within the statement itself, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their previous states. The conditions for updating `r`, `l`, and `k` will be checked again in the next iteration of the loop.
