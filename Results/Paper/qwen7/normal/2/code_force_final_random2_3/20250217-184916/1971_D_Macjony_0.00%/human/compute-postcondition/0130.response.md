Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and a binary string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500). For each test case, it processes the binary string s based on the integer t and returns a result accordingly.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a positive integer `t` and a binary string `s`. The function processes the binary string `s` according to the value of `t` and returns a specific result for each test case.
