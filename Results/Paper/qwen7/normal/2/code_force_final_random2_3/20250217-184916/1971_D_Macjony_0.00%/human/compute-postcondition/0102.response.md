Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `i` is 3, `s` is the new input string, `count` is either 1 or 2, `flag` is either False or True, `j` is incremented by 1.**

The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
