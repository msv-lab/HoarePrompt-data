Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `i` is 2, `s` is a new input string with its length greater than 3, `count` is 3, `flag` is True, `j` is less than `len(s) - 1**.

Explanation: The line `flag = True` sets the variable `flag` to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
