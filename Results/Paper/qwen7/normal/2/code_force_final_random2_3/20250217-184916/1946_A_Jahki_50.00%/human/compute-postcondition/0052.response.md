Output State: **`case` is an input string from the user, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `i` is 2, `num2` is an integer input from the user, `total` is 0, `students` is 1, `new_median` is equal to `median`, `op` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `case` and converting each digit to an integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained by sorting `a`, `median` is `b[ma]` (where `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, or `num2 // 2` if `num2` is odd).**

Explanation: The line `new_median = median` simply assigns the value of `median` to `new_median`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged.
