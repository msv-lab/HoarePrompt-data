Output State: **`case` is a string input from the user, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `i` is 0, `num2` is an input integer less than or equal to 10000, `op` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `case` and converting each digit to an integer, `b` is a list of integers which is a sorted version of `a`**.

Explanation: The code `b = sorted(a)` sorts the list `a` in ascending order and assigns the sorted list to `b`. The other variables remain unchanged.
