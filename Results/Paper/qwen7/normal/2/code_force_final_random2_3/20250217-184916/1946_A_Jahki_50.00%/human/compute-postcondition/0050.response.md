Postcondition: **`case` is an input string from the user, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `i` is 2, `num2` is an integer input from the user, `total` is 0, `students` is 1, `new_median` is the maximum value in the list `b`, `op` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `case` and converting each digit to an integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained by sorting `a`. If `num2` is even, `ma` is an integer equal to `int(num2 / 2) - 1`. If `num2` is odd, `ma` is an integer equal to `num2 // 2`.**
