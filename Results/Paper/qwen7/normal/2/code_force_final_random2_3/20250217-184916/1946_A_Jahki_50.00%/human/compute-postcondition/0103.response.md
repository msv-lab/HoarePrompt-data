Based on the initial state provided:

- `b` is a sorted list of integers where each element has been incremented by 1 starting from the middle index `ma` until `new_median` exceeds `median`.
- `i` is 5, indicating the loop has completed its iterations.
- `num2` is an integer input from the user.
- `total` is 0.
- `students` is 1.
- `new_median` is the updated median after all increments.
- `op` is the total number of operations performed (which is the number of times the loop executed).
- `b` is a sorted version of `a`.
- `median` is the original median before any increments.

The `print(op)` statement will print the value of `op`, which is the total number of operations performed during the loop execution. Since the loop increments elements starting from the middle index `ma` until `new_median` exceeds `median`, the number of operations (`op`) is the count of such increments.

Given that the loop completes its iterations and `i` is set to 5, it implies that the loop ran 5 times. Therefore, `op` is 5.

Output: **5**
