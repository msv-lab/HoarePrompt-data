Output State: **`num` is an input integer, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases.**

Explanation: The code `num = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `num`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still represents the number of test cases as per the initial state. The value of `n` and the list `a` are not yet defined and will be determined in subsequent steps.
