Output State: **`case` is an input string from the user, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `i` is 3, `num2` is an integer input from the user, `total` is 0, `students` is 1, `new_median` must be less than or equal to `median`, `op` is 1, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `num` is the same as the initial or previous state, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `case` and converting each digit to an integer, `b` is a sorted version of `a`, `median` is `b[ma]`, `b` is now a sorted version of `b`.**

Explanation: The code `b = sorted(b)` sorts the list `b` which was already sorted. Sorting a list that is already sorted does not change the list. Therefore, the list `b` remains the same as its previous sorted version. All other variables remain unchanged.
