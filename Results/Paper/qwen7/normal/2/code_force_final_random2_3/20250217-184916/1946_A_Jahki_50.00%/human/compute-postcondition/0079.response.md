Output State: **`case` is an input string from the user, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `i` is 2, `num2` is an integer input from the user, `total` is 0, `students` is 1, `new_median` is the maximum value in the list `b`, `op` is 0, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `num` is the same as the initial or previous state, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `case` and converting each digit to an integer.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `a` by splitting the string `case` into substrings using whitespace as the delimiter, filtering out non-digit strings, and converting the remaining digit strings to integers. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
