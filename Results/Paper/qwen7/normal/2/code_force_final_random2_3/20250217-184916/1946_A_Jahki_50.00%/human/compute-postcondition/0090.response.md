Output State: **`case` is an input string from the user, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `i` is 3, `num2` is an integer input from the user, `total` is 0, `students` is 1, `new_median` is equal to `b[ma]`, `op` is 1, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `num` is the same as the initial or previous state, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `case` and converting each digit to an integer, `b` is a sorted version of `a`, `median` is `b[ma]`, `b` is now a sorted version of `b`.**

Explanation: The line `new_median = b[ma]` assigns the value of `b[ma]` to `new_median`. Here, `ma` refers to the middle index of the list `b`, which is already sorted. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previous states.
