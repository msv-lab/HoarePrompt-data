Output State: **`case` is a string input from the user, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `i` is 0, `num2` is an input integer, `op` is 0**.

The code simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `op`. No other changes are made to the existing variables or their values. Therefore, the values of `case`, `t`, `i`, and `num2` remain unchanged, and `op` is set to 0.
