Output State: The loop will continue to execute as long as `new_median` is less than or equal to `median`. After all iterations, the list `b` will be sorted, `ma` will be incremented multiple times until `new_median` becomes greater than `median`. The variable `op` will keep track of the total number of iterations, which is the sum of the first `num2` natural numbers. The `new_median` will eventually become greater than `median`, and the loop will terminate. The final state of `b` will be such that it has been modified according to the rules inside the loop, and `ma` will point to an index where `new_median` is just greater than `median`.

In more detail, the output state will be:
- `b` is a sorted list of integers.
- `ma` is the last index where `new_median` was updated.
- `op` is the total number of iterations, which is the sum of the first `num2` natural numbers.
- `new_median` is the value at index `ma` in the list `b`, and it is the smallest value in `b` that is greater than the original `median`.
- All other variables (`case`, `t`, `i`, `num2`, `total`, `students`, `a`) remain unchanged from their initial or previous states.
