Output State: **`b` is sorted, `ma` is incremented by 1, `op` is increased by 3, `new_median` is equal to `b[ma-1]`, and `b` is sorted again.**

Explanation: The code `b = sorted(b)` sorts the list `b` again, which does not change its sorted state since it was already sorted initially. The other variables (`ma`, `op`, and `new_median`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
