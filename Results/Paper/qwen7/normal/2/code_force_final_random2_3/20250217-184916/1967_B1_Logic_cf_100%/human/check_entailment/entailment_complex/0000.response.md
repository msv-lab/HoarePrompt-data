Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Reading Input**: The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `m`.

2. **Initialization**: The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`. This is a good start since the pair `(a, b)` where `a = n` and `b = 1` always satisfies the condition because `a + b = n + 1` and `b * gcd(a, b) = 1 * gcd(n, 1) = 1`, making `a + b` a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

3. **Loop Logic**: The loop iterates from `b = 2` to `b = min(n, m)`. For each `b`, it adds `(n + b) // (b * b)` to `ans`. However, this part of the logic seems incorrect. The condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` should be checked for all possible pairs `(a, b)` within the given ranges.

4. **Calculation**: The expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` does not correctly represent the count of valid pairs. Instead, for each `b`, we need to find how many `a` values satisfy the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. This involves checking each `a` from `1` to `n` and verifying the condition.

5. **Output**: The code prints the value of `ans` after processing each test case. However, the value of `ans` calculated in the current implementation does not correctly reflect the number of valid pairs.

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
