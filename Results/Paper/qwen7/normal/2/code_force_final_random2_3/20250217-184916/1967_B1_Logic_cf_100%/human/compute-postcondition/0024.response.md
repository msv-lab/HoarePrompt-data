Output State: **`ans` is increased by 2 \((n + b) // (b * b)\), `b` is \(k + 2\) and `b` must be within the range 2 to \(\min(n, m) + 1\)**.

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by adding \((n + b) // (b * b)\) twice. Since `b` is defined as \(k + 2\), and `b` must be within the range 2 to \(\min(n, m) + 1\), these conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state of `ans` reflects the addition of \(2 \times (n + b) // (b * b)\).
