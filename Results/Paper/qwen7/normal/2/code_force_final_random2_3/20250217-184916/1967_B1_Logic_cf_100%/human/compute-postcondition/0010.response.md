Output State: **`ans` is `ans + (n + 3) // (3 * 3) + (n + 4) // (4 * 4)`, `t` is greater than 0, `b` is 4, `min(n, m)` must be at least 3**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is updated by adding `(n + 3) // (3 * 3)` and `(n + 4) // (4 * 4)`. The other variables `t`, `b`, and the condition about `min(n, m)` remain unchanged.
