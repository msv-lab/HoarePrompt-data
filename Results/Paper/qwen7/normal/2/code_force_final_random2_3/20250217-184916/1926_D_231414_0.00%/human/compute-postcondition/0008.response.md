Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the iterable `data`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The variable `i` is initialized to the first element of the list `data` when the loop starts. Therefore, `i` must be one of the elements in the list `data`.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `data`**: Since `data` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer, the list must contain at least one integer.

4. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`times`, `n`, `dic`, `ans`, and `check`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `data` is a non-empty list containing at least one integer. The initial value of `i` will be the first element of this list.

**State after adjustment:**
- `data` must be a non-empty list containing at least one integer.
- `i` will be the first element of the list `data`.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`data` is a non-empty list containing at least one integer, `i` is the first element of the list `data`**.
