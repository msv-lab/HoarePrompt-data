Output State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `n`. The precondition that `times` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. Therefore, `times` is still greater than 0, and `n` now holds the value of the integer input provided by the user.
