Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `char` and `expression`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `expression` is a non-empty string consisting of characters `+` and `-`.
   - `char` is the next character in the string.
   - `count` is 2.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are more characters in the `expression` string.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `char` is the next character in the string, after processing the current character, `char` will be the next character in the string.
   - The `expression` string remains the same unless modified within the loop body, but since no modifications are mentioned, it stays the same.
   - `count` is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted here.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `expression` remains a non-empty string consisting of characters `+` and `-`.
   - `char` becomes the next character in the string (the one following the current `char`).
   - `count` remains 2 (though this is not part of the loop head, it is mentioned for context).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`expression` is a non-empty string consisting of characters `+` and `-`, `char` is the next character in the string, and `count` is 2**.
