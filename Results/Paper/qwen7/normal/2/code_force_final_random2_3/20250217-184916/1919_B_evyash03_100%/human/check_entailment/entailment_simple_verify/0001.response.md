### Reasoning

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the flaw in the provided program. Let's break down the issues and verify the solution step-by-step:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The goal is to minimize the penalty by splitting the array `a` (represented by the string `s`) into subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty for a subarray is defined as the absolute value of the sum of its elements multiplied by its length.

2. **Provided Program Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` counts the number of `+` characters in the string `expression`.
   - It then calculates `sub` as the difference between the length of the string and the count of `+` characters.
   - It returns the absolute difference between `count` and `sub`.

3. **Detailed Reasoning:**
   - The current implementation does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty.
   - The penalty calculation in the function is incorrect because it does not account for the optimal splitting strategy.

4. **Correct Implementation:**
   - To minimize the penalty, we need to split the array at every change from `+` to `-` or vice versa.
   - Each subarray should ideally have a sum as close to zero as possible.

5. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotated code shows that after counting the `+` characters, the program incorrectly calculates the penalty as `abs(sub - count)`.

6. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach involves iterating through the string and splitting it at every change in sign.
   - For each subarray, calculate the sum and multiply by its length to get the penalty.
   - Sum these penalties to get the total penalty.

Given the detailed analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not implement the optimal strategy for minimizing the penalty.
