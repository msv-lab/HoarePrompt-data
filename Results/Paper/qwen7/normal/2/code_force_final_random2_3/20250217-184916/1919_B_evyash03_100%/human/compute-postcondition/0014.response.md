Output State: **The program returns the absolute difference between the length of `expression` minus the total number of '+' characters in `expression`, and the total number of '+' characters in `expression`**

This means if `expression` has a length of `L` and contains `C` '+' characters, the program returns \(|L - C - C| = |L - 2C|\).
