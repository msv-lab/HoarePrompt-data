### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated code step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to minimize the penalty by optimally splitting the array \(a\) into non-empty subarrays \(b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_k\). The penalty for each subarray \(b_i\) is calculated as \(p(b_i) = | \text{sum}(b_i) | \cdot \text{len}(b_i)\), and the total penalty is the sum of penalties of all subarrays.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string \(n\) and the string \(s\).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes the string `expression` and its length `length` as inputs.
   - It counts the number of '+' characters in the string using the variable `count`.
   - It then calculates `sub` as `length - count`.
   - Finally, it returns `abs(sub - count)`.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The function `func_1` does not actually perform any optimal splitting of the array. Instead, it calculates a simple difference between the length of the string and the count of '+' characters, and returns the absolute value of this difference.
- This approach does not account for the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty. For example, it does not consider the signs of the elements in the array and how they can be grouped to minimize the penalty.

#### Example Analysis:
Consider the example input:
```
10
--+++++++-
```
- The string `expression` is `"--+++++++-"`.
- The length of the string is 10.
- The count of '+' characters is 7.
- The count of '-' characters is 3.
- The function calculates `sub` as `10 - 7 = 3`.
- The function returns `abs(3 - 7) = 4`.

However, the optimal split would be `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1])`, resulting in a penalty of 0.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` does not implement the logic required to find the optimal splits of the array to minimize the penalty. Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
