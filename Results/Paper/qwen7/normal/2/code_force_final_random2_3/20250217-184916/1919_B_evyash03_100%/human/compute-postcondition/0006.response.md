Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `char` which is derived from iterating over each character in the string `expression`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are more characters in the string `expression` to iterate over.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `expression` is a non-empty string consisting of characters `+` and `-`.
   - `count` is set to 1 if the current character being checked is `+`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop is iterating through each character in `expression`, at the start of the next iteration, `char` will be the next character in the string.
   - `count` will remain 1 if the current character is `+`, or it will still be 1 if the current character is `-` (since no change is mentioned).

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `expression` remains the same as it is the input string.
   - `char` will be the next character in the string `expression`.
   - `count` will remain 1 unless the next character is `+`, but since no specific action is mentioned for `-`, it stays 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`expression` is a non-empty string consisting of characters `+` and `-`, `char` is the next character in the string, `count` is 1**.
