Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5), an integer `t` (where t = 1), and lists of integers `u` and `v` (where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n). Additionally, it takes a list of starting nodes containing `t` integers (1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n). The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves. The function returns information based on these inputs.**

Note: The actual return value is not specified in the given information, so the description focuses on the parameters and their constraints.
