Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `u` is an input integer, `v` is added to the list `tree`, `i` is 3.**

Explanation: The code `tree.append(v)` adds the value of `v` to the list `tree`. The values of `n`, `u`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, `n` must still be greater than 1, `u` remains an input integer, `v` is now part of the list `tree`, and `i` is still 3.
