Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 1, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `i` is 3, and `tree` is a list. If `empty` is False, then `tree` contains `u` and `v`. If `empty` is True, then `v` is added to `tree`. If `v` equals the last element of `tree`, then `v` is added to the end of `tree`. Otherwise, if `v` equals the first element of `tree`, then `v` is added to the left end of `tree`; otherwise, `v` is added to the list `tree`.
