Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 5, `i` is 4, `u` is an input integer converted to an integer, `v` is an input integer converted to an integer, `tree` is a list. If `v` is equal to the first element of `tree`, `u` is appended to the left end of `tree`. If `v` is equal to the last element of `tree`, `u` is appended to the right end of `tree`. If neither condition is met, `v` is appended to the right end of `tree`.
