Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `i` is 3, `tree` has `v` added to its left end.**

Explanation: The code `tree.appendleft(v)` adds the value of `v` to the left end of the list `tree`. Since `v` is an input integer, the list `tree` now includes `v` at its beginning. The other variables remain unchanged.
