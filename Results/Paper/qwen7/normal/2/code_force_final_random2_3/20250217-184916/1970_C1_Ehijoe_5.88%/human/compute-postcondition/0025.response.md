Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 1, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer and is not equal to `tree[0]` and is not equal to `tree[-1]`. After the execution of the if-else block, if `u` equals the first element of `tree`, `tree` now has `v` as its new first element. Otherwise, `u` equals the last element of `tree`, and `tree` now contains one additional element which is `v`.
