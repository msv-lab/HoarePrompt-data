Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, and `tree` now contains the integer `u`.**

Explanation: The code `tree.append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the list `tree`. Since `u` is an input integer, after executing this line, `tree` will contain the integer `u`. The other variables (`n` and `v`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
