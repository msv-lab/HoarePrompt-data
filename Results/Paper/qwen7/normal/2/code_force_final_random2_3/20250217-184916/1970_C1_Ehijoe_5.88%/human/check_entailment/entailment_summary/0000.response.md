Reasoning:
1. The problem involves a special type of tree with exactly two leaves, which can be treated like an array.
2. The goal is to determine the winner of the game based on the optimal strategy of both players.
3. The program reads the input values for `n` and `t`, where `t` is fixed at 1. It then constructs a deque `tree` based on the edges of the tree.
4. The program correctly identifies the index of the starting node within the deque.
5. It calculates the minimum distances from the starting node to the two leaves and checks if either distance is odd.
6. Based on the parity of the distances, it determines the winner and prints the appropriate name.

Given the execution summary and the provided code, the logic appears to be correct. The program handles the construction of the tree using a deque, finds the index of the starting node, and correctly determines the winner based on the distances to the leaves.

Correctness: **True**
