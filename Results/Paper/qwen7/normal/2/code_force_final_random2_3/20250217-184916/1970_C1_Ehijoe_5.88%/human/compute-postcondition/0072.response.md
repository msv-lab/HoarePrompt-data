Output State: **`tree` deque contains `n` elements, `empty` is `False`, `i` is `n`, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`, `moves` is a list containing `[min(n, idx), min(n, n - idx - 1)]`.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `moves` with two elements. Both elements are calculated using the `min` function applied to `n` and `idx`, and `n` and `n - idx - 1`. Since `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`, the values of `idx` and `n` remain unchanged. The other variables (`empty` and `i`) are not affected by this code.
