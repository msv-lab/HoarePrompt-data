Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `u` is an input integer and currently equals `tree[-1]`, `v` is an input integer and is not equal to `tree[0]` and is not equal to `tree[-1]` and is not equal to `u`, and `tree` now contains one additional element which is `v`.**

Explanation: The code `tree.append(v)` adds the value of `v` to the list `tree`. Since `v` is not equal to `tree[0]`, `tree[-1]`, and `u`, the new value added to the list is `v`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
