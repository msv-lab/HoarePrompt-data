Output State: **`n` must be greater than 5, `i` is 4, `u` is an input integer converted to an integer, `v` is an input integer converted to an integer, `tree` is a list with `v` appended to the left end.**

Explanation: The code `tree.appendleft(v)` appends the value of `v` to the left end of the list `tree`. The values of `n`, `i`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 5 is still valid.
