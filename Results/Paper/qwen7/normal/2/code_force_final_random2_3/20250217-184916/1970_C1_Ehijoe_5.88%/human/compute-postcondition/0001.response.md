Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ `u`, `v` ≤ `n`, the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains 1 integer such that 1 ≤ `u_1` ≤ `n`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 × 10^5, and `tree` is an empty deque.**

The code initializes an empty deque named `tree`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `u`, `v`, or `n`, nor does it change the conditions or values associated with these variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `u`, `v`, and `n` remain as they were before the code execution, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) and the condition on `u` and `v` also remain unchanged.
