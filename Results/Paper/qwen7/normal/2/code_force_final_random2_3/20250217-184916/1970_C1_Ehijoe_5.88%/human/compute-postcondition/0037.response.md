Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `i` is 3, `tree` contains the element `u`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `u` to the list `tree`. The values of `n`, `v`, and `i` remain unchanged. The initial state of `u` being an input integer and `v` being an input integer from the split input are preserved. The only change is that `tree` now contains the element `u`.
