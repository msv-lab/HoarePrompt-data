Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 1, `u` and `v` are input integers. If `tree` is not empty, `tree` now contains the integers `[u, v]`. If `tree` is empty, then either `v` becomes the new first element of `tree` (if `v` equals the first element of `tree`), `u` becomes the new last element of `tree` (if `v` equals the last element of `tree`), or `tree` now contains one additional element which is `v` (if neither of the above conditions is met).
