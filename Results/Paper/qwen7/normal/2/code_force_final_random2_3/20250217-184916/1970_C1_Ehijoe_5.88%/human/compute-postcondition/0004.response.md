Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `u, v = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into integers. These integers are then assigned to `u` and `v`. The initial condition that `n` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new variables `u` and `v` with their respective values being the integers from the input, while the condition on `n` is still valid.
