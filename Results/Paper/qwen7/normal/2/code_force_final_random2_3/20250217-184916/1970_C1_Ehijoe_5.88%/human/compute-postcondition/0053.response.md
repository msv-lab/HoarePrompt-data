Output State: **`n` must be greater than 5, `i` is 4, `u` is an input integer converted to an integer, `v` is an input integer converted to an integer, `tree` is a list with `u` and `v` appended to it, `empty` is False.**

Explanation: The variable `empty` is assigned the boolean value `False`. This assignment does not affect the values of `n`, `i`, `u`, `v`, or `tree`. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
