Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `c` is the sum of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`, `l` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The variable `s` is assigned the value `0`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
