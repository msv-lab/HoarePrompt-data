Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `c` is the sum of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`**.

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The variable `c` is defined based on the initial state as the sum of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`. Since no calculation involving `c` is performed in the given code, `c` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, along with the unchanged value of `c` as per the initial definition.
