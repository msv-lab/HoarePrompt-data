Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`.**

Explanation: The line `s = min(m, k)` assigns the minimum value between `m` and `k` to `s`. Since `i` and `n` are not affected by this line of code, their states remain unchanged. The value of `s` is determined by comparing `m` and `k`, but without specific values for `m` and `k`, `s` is expressed as the minimum of these two variables.
