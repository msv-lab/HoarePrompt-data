Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is `k - s`.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is decremented by the value of `s`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. The exact value of `k` after the operation depends on the initial value of `k` and the value of `s`.
