Reasoning:
Let's analyze the provided program against the problem statement and the given example.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` followed by a list of prices `l`.

2. **Sorting the Prices**: The program sorts the list `l` of prices. Sorting is a valid step to ensure that we consider the cheapest days first when buying tickets.

3. **Iterating Through Days**: The program iterates through the sorted list of prices. For each day, it determines how many tickets (`s`) can be bought without exceeding the remaining required tickets (`k`). It then updates the cumulative cost `c` accordingly.

4. **Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation part seems to have a mistake. Specifically, the formula `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2` is incorrect. This formula subtracts a quadratic term which doesn't align with the problem's requirements. The correct approach should simply add the cost of the tickets bought on the current day.

5. **Output**: The program prints the final cumulative cost `c` for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the program has a logical error in the cost calculation part. The correct approach should be to simply add the cost of the tickets bought on the current day without any additional terms.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
