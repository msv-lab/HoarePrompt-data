Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `n`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop `for i in range(n)` will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initially set to `n`, the loop will not execute because `i` is already equal to `n`, and the loop condition requires `i < n`.
   - To make the loop execute at least once, `i` must be less than `n`.

5. **Conclusion**: We need to adjust the state such that `i` is less than `n`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

**State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `c` is `k * k / 2`**
