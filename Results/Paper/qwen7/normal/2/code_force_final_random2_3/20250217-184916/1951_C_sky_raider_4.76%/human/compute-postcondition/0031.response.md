Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `k` is updated as `k - s`.
   - `c` is updated as `l[0] * s - s * s / 2`.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0, after one iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 0.

4. **Update the states**:
   - `i` changes to 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged but must still be greater than 0.
   - `k` and `c` are not part of the loop head and their values do not change based on the loop condition alone.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
