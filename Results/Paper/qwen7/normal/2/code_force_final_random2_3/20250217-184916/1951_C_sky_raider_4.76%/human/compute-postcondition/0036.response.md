Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`.**

The code assigns the minimum value between `m` and `k` to `s`. Since the values of `m` and `k` are not specified, `s` is left as the minimum value between them. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
