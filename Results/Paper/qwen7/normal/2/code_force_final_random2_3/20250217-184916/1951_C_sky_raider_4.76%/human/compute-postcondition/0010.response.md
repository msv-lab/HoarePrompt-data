Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `c` is `l[0] * s - s * s / 2`
   - `k` is `k - s`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, after incrementing `i` by 1, `i` will become 1.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` changes from 0 to 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged but must still be greater than 0.
   - The values of `c` and `k` are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
