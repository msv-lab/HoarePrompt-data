Output State: **`numCases` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a non-empty list of input strings sorted in ascending order without the first element, `suma` is 0, `a` is the integer value of the first element in the original `numbers` list.**

Explanation: The code `a = int(numbers.pop(0))` pops the first element from the list `numbers` and converts it to an integer, assigning it to `a`. The precondition that `numbers` is a non-empty list remains true, but it now lacks its first element. All other variables retain their initial conditions except for `a`, which now holds the integer value of the first element of the original `numbers` list.
