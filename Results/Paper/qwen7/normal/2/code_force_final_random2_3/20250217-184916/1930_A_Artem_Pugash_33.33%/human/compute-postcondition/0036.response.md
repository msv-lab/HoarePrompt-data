Output State: **`numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is the original `numbers` list with its first element removed, `a` is the integer value of the first element that was popped from the `numbers` list, `b` is the integer value of the first element that was popped from the `numbers` list, `suma` is updated by adding the minimum of `a` and `b`**.

In more natural language: `numCases` must still be greater than 0, `i` remains 2, `numInteger` is still an input integer, the `numbers` list now lacks its first element, `a` is the integer value of the first element that was removed from `numbers`, `b` is also the integer value of the first element that was removed from `numbers`, and `suma` has been updated to include the minimum value between `a` and `b`.
