Output State: **`numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` has one less element, `suma` is 0, `a` is the first element of `numbers` before popping, `b` is the first element of `numbers` before popping.**

Explanation: The code `b = int(numbers.pop(0))` pops the first element from the list `numbers` and assigns it to `b`. Since `numbers` had one less element before the pop operation, it now has one less element. The value of `a` was the first element of `numbers` before popping, so `b` now holds that value. All other variables remain unchanged.
