You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the numbers on the whiteboard are 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
def func():
    numCases = int(input())
    for i in range(numCases):
        numInteger = int(input())
        
        numbers = input().split()
        
        numbers.sort(reverse=False)
        
        suma = 0
        
        while numbers != []:
            a = int(numbers.pop(0))
            b = int(numbers.pop(0))
            suma += min(a, b)
        
        print(suma)
        
    #State: Output State: `numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `numCases`, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is an empty list, `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of all pairs of integers taken from the original list, with each pair's larger number decremented by 1 before adding to `suma`.
    #
    #After the loop executes all its iterations, `numCases` will be equal to the number of times the loop was executed, which is also the total number of cases processed. The variable `i` will be equal to `numCases` since the loop increments `i` in each iteration until it reaches `numCases`. The `numbers` list will be empty because all elements have been processed in pairs. The variable `suma` will hold the cumulative sum of the minimum values from each pair of integers that were popped from the list during the loop's execution, with the larger number of each pair decremented by 1 before being added to `suma`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes values within a defined range for `t` and `n`, and an array of `2n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}`. It returns a result based on the conditions specified for `t` and `n`, and the values of the integers on the whiteboard.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
