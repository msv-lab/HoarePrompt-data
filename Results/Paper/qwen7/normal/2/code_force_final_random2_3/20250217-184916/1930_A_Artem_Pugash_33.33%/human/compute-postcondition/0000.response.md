Output State: **`numCases` is an input integer, and the values of `t` and `n` and the numbers on the whiteboard remain unchanged**.

Explanation: The code `numCases = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `numCases`. The initial values of `t` and `n` and the numbers on the whiteboard (which are represented by the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, these values remain as they were in the initial state.
