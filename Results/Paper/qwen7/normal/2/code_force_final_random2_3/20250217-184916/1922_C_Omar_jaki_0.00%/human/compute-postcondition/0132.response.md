Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `a`, two integers `x` and `y` for each query, and an integer `m` representing the number of queries. It returns the difference between elements at indices `x` and `y` for each query.**

This means the function processes a list of integers `a` and handles `m` queries. Each query consists of two indices `x` and `y` within the range of the list. The function calculates and returns the difference between the elements at these indices for each query.
