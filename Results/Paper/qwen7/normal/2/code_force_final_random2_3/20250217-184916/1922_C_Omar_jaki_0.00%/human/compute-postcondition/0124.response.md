Given the initial state:
- `u` is a falsy value (which means it could be `None`, `False`, `0`, `''`, etc., but its specific value does not affect the print statement).
- `c` is the return value from function `r()`.
- `d` is the return value from function `r()`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
```

Here, `b` is a list, and the indices used to access elements in the list are derived from `d` and `c`.

Let's break down the expression inside the print statement:
- `(d - 1) * 2` calculates an index for the list `b`.
- `(c - 1) * 2` calculates another index for the list `b`.

The print statement then subtracts the element at the second index from the element at the first index.

Since the exact contents of the list `b` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical result. However, we can describe the operation that will be performed.

Output: **b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2]**
