Output State: **`v` is `y - x`, `x` is `w`, `y` is `x`, `z` is `y`, `v` is `x - x` which equals 0.**

In this case, the code `v = y - x` updates the value of `v` to be `y - x`. Given the initial state where `y` is equal to `x`, `v` becomes `x - x`, which simplifies to 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
