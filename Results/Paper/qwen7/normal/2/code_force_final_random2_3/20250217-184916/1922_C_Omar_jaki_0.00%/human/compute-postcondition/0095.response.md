Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop is defined as follows:
   ```python
   for (w, x, y, z) in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```
   The loop variables are `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z`.

2. **Understand the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `a` is a list with at least 4 elements.
   - `u` is a falsy value.
   - `c` and `d` are the return values from the function `r()`.
   - `b` is `[0 + b[-2] + v]`, where `v` is some value.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are enough elements in `a` to form tuples of `(w, x, y, z)`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:])`, each tuple `(w, x, y, z)` is formed by taking elements from `a` starting from the first element up to the fourth-to-last element.
   - For the loop to continue, `a` must have at least 5 elements (since it needs to provide 4 elements for the next tuple).

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that `a` has at least 5 elements, while keeping other states unchanged.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` is a list with at least 5 elements, `u` is a falsy value, `c` and `d` are the return values from function `r()`, `b` is `[0 + b[-2] + v]`**
