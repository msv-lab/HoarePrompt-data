State right before the while loop: `i` is 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `n` is the integer obtained from the first element of `l1`, and `k` is the integer obtained from the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 1.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will always execute at least once.
2. There are no conditions in the loop head that depend on any variables, so no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

Since the loop will always execute regardless of the current state of the variables, no changes are necessary.

State: **`i` is 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `n` is the integer obtained from the first element of `l1`, and `k` is the integer obtained from the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 1**
