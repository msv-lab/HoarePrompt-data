Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the placeholder `_`, which is used as a throwaway variable to iterate over the range returned by `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` returns a non-negative integer. Since the input is a positive integer `t` (as given in the state), the loop will execute as long as `t` is a positive integer.

3. **Adjust the State**: The state before the loop starts is given as `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means `t` is already a valid input for the loop to execute. No adjustments are needed for `t` itself since it is already within the required range.

4. **Consider the Input Process**: The loop will read an input value for each iteration, but the initial state does not include this input directly. However, the loop will continue to execute as long as the input is a positive integer within the specified range.

Given these points, the state does not need to be adjusted further because the condition for the loop to execute (i.e., reading a positive integer from input) is already satisfied by the given state.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**

This state is sufficient to ensure the loop can execute, as the loop will continue to read inputs until a non-positive integer is entered, which is not the case given the constraints.
