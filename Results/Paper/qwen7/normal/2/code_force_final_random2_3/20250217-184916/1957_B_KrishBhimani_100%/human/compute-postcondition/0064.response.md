Output State: **`i` is 0 or 1; `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input; `n` is an integer obtained from the first element of `l1`; `k` is an integer obtained from the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list; `k0` is equal to `k`; `ans` is an empty list; `temp` is now `temp * 2` depending on its initial value.**

Explanation: The code `temp *= 2` multiplies the current value of `temp` by 2. Since the initial value of `temp` is either 2 or 4, after executing this line, `temp` will be 4 or 8, respectively. The states of other variables remain unchanged.
