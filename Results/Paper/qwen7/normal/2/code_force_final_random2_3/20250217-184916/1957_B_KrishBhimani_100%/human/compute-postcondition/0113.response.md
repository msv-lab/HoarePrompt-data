Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of two positive integers n and k. For each test case, it checks if 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and if the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. It then returns a result based on the validation of these conditions.**
