Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is an integer converted from the second element of `l1`. If `n` equals 1, then `k` remains unchanged, and the program does not modify `arr`, `i`, `ans`, or `temp`. Otherwise, `k0` is equal to `k`, `arr` is an empty list, `i` is a non-negative integer, `ans` is a list containing three elements \([0, (1 << i) - 1, k - (1 << i) - 1]\), and `temp` is such that `temp * 2 \>= k`.
