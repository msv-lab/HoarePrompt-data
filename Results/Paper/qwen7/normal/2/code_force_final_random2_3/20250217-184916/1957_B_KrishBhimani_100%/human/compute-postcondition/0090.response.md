Output State: **`i` is 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `n` is the integer obtained from the first element of `l1`, and `k` is the integer obtained from the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change any variable values but instead exits the current loop or conditional block. Since no loop or conditional block is specified in the given code snippet, the only effect is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. All other variables retain their initial or previously calculated states.
