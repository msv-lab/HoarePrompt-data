The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` was 0, so now `i` is 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is an integer converted from the second element of `l1`, `k0` is equal to `k`, `arr` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 2, and the current value of `temp` is less than half of `k`.
