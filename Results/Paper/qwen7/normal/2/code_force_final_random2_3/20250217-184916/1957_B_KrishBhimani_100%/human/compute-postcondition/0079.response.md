Based on the initial state provided:

- `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.
- `n` is the integer obtained from the first element of `l1`.
- `k` is the integer obtained from the second element of `l1`.

The `print(k)` statement will print the value of `k`, which is the integer obtained from the second element of the list `l1`.

Output: **k (where k is the integer obtained from the second element of the list l1)**
