Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is an integer converted from the second element of `l1`, `k0` is equal to `k`, `arr` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the current loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block immediately surrounding the `break` statement in the given code snippet, the variables remain in their initial states.
