The only variable in the loop head is the condition itself, which is `True`. Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute as long as the loop body does not explicitly break out of it. Therefore, no adjustments to the states are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

However, to provide a clear answer based on the given format:

State: **`i` is 0 or 1, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `n` is the integer obtained from the first element of `l1`, and `k` is the integer obtained from the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list, and `temp` is either 1 or 4 depending on whether `temp * 2 < k` is true or false**
