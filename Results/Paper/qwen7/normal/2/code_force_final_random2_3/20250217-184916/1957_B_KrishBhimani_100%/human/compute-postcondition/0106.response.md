Output State: **`i` is between 1 and 4 (inclusive), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `n` is the integer obtained from the first element of `l1`, and `k` is the integer obtained from the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is a list containing two elements which are `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - sum(ans)`, and `temp` is a power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code appends `k - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` contains one element, which is `(1 << i) - 1`. After appending, `ans` now contains two elements: `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`, which simplifies to `k - (2^i - 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
