Postcondition: `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `n` is the integer obtained from the first element of `l1`, and `k` is the integer obtained from the second element of `l1`. If `n == 1`, the function does not change `arr`, `i`, `ans`, `k0`, `temp`, and `temp` remains a power of 2 less than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, `i` is between 1 and 4 (inclusive), `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is a list containing two elements which are `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - sum(ans)`, and `temp` is a power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`. Additionally, `ans` has been extended by `[0] * (n - len(ans))`.
