Output State: **`i` is 0 or 1, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `n` is an integer obtained from the first element of `l1`, and `k` is an integer obtained from the second element of `l1`; `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list, and we break out of the loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or if statement. Therefore, the values of `i`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `k0`, `ans`, and `temp` remain unchanged.
