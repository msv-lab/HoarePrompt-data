Output State: **`temp` is such that temp * 2 < k and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the value of `temp`, but it indicates that we are breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. The condition `temp * 2 < k` remains unchanged.
