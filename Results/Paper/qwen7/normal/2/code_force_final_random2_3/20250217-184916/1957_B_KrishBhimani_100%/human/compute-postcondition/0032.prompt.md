Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is an integer converted from the second element of `l1`, `k0` is equal to `k`, `arr` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 1.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    if temp * 2 < k:
        temp *= 2
        i += 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`, `k` is an integer converted from the second element of `l1`, `k0` is equal to `k`, `arr` is an empty list, `i` is either 0 or 1, `ans` is an empty list, and `temp` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `temp * 2 < k` is true or false.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `temp` is doubled and `i` is increased by 1 if `temp * 2 < k`. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `temp` is such that `temp * 2 < k`. If `temp * 2` is less than `k`, we continue as is. If `temp * 2` is not less than `k`, then `i` is increased by 1. If `temp * 2` is not less than `k` and there is a loop or conditional structure, we break out of it.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
