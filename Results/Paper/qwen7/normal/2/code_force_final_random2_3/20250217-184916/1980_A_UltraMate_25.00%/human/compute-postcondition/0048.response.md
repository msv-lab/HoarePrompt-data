Output State: **`i` is 'B', `ans` is increased by `m`, `hmp` and `m` are unknown**

The code `ans += m` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `m`. Since the initial state does not specify a particular value for `m`, it remains unknown. The value of `i` and `hmp` are not affected by this operation.
