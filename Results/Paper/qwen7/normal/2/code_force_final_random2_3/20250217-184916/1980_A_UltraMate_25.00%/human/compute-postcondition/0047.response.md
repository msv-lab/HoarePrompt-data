Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `p`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the sequence `p`.

3. **Analyze the postcondition**: After each iteration, if `i` is not in `hmp`, then `ans` is increased by `m`.

4. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 'A'.
   - There is no information about `hmp`, `ans`, or `m` from the given state.

5. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is 'A', we need to check if 'A' is in `hmp`. If it is not, `ans` will be increased by `m`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` will take the next value from the sequence `p`.

Given that `i` is 'A', let's assume the next value in `p` is `j`. We don't know what `j` is, but we know the loop will continue if `j` is not in `hmp`.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be set to the next value in `p`, which we denote as `j`.
   - `ans` will remain unchanged unless `i` ('A') was not in `hmp`, in which case it would have been incremented by `m`.

Since we don't have specific values for `hmp`, `ans`, or `m`, we can only adjust the state of `i` to the next value in `p`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is the next value in `p` (denoted as `j`), `ans` is unchanged, `hmp` and `m` are unknown**.

If we need to provide a concrete example, we can say:

State: **`i` is 'B', `ans` is unchanged, `hmp` and `m` are unknown**.
