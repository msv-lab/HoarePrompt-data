Output State: **`ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`, `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is incremented by the difference between `m` and the current value of `hmp[i]`. The condition that `hmp[i]` is less than `m` remains true after the operation. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
