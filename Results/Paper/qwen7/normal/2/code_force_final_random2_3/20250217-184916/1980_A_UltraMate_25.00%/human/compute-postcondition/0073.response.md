Output State: **`t` is 5, `hmp` is a collection containing 'ABCDEF', the first element of `hmp` is 'A', `m` is 'F', `ans` is 20, `n` is an input integer, and `m` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated inputs from the user and converts them into integers. The values of `t`, `hmp`, `m`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The values of `n` and `m` are set to the integers obtained from the input. Since the exact input values are not specified, they are referred to as "an input integer."
