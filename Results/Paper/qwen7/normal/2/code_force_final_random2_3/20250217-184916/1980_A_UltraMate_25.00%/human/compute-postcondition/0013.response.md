Output State: **`i` is 'B', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `ans` is equal to `m` plus the previous value of `ans`**.

The code `ans += m` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `m`. However, since `m` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact numerical value. Therefore, we express the updated value of `ans` as the sum of its previous value and `m`. The variables `i` and `p` remain unchanged from their initial states.
