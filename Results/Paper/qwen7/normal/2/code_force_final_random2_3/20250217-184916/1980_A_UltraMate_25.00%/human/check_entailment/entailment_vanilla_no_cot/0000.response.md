Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly account for all necessary conditions to solve the problem. Specifically, it misses considering the requirement that each round must have exactly one problem of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G'). The current logic only checks for the presence of at least one problem of each required difficulty level across all rounds, but it does not ensure that each round gets exactly one problem of each difficulty level.

To fix this, we need to count the occurrences of each difficulty level and calculate the shortfall for each level separately for each round. Here's an improved version of the code:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        hmp = Counter(s)
        
        # Count the number of missing problems for each difficulty level
        missing_problems = [m - hmp.get(chr(65 + i), 0) for i in range(7)]
        
        # Sum the total number of missing problems
        ans = sum(max(0, x) for x in missing_problems)
        print(ans)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This updated code correctly calculates the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create to ensure that each round can have one problem of each difficulty level.
