Output State: **All elements in 'ABCDEF' have been iterated over. The variable `ans` is increased by `m` for each iteration where the current character `i` is not in `hmp`. Variables `hmp` and `m` remain unchanged.**

In more detail, since the loop iterates over each character in the string 'ABCDEF', and for each character `i` that is not found in `hmp`, `ans` is incremented by `m`. After all iterations, `ans` will be equal to `m` multiplied by the number of characters in 'ABCDEF' that are not present in `hmp`. The variables `hmp` and `m` remain unchanged throughout the loop's execution.
