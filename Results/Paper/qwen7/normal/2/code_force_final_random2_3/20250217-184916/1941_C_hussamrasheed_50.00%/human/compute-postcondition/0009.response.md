The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `n` is an input integer.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `t`. Since `i` is currently 1, `t` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the string input by the user without the substring 'map', `m` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original `s`, `p` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`**
