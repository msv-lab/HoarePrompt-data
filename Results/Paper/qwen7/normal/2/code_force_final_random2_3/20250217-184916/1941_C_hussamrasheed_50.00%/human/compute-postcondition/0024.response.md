Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `t`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the string input by the user without any occurrence of 'map', `m` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original `s`, `p` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `i` will be equal to `t`. The variables `n` and `s` will retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop, which means `s` will no longer contain any occurrences of 'map'. Both `m` and `p` will hold the counts of 'map' and 'pie' respectively in the original string `s` before any replacements were made.
