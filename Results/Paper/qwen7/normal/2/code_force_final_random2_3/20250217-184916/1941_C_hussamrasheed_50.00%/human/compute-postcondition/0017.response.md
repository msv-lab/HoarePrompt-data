Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(t)` statement. The variables involved here are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `t` must be greater than 1
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is the integer input by the user (this variable is not part of the loop head)
   - `s` is the string input by the user without any occurrence of 'map' (this variable is not part of the loop head)
   - `p` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s` (this variable is not part of the loop head)

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `t`. Currently, `i` is 1, so the loop can execute again if `t` is greater than 1.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2. Therefore, `t` must remain greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

**Final State**:
- `t` must be greater than 1
- `i` is 2

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2**
