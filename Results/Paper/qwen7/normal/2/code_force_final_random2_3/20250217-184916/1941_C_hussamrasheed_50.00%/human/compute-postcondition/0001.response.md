State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(t)`.
2. The variable `i` is used as the loop counter, starting from 0 up to `t-1`.
3. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0 because `range(t)` will generate numbers from 0 to `t-1`.
4. The initial value of `i` is set to 1 because the loop starts counting from 0, and the first iteration will increment `i` to 1.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `t` is greater than 0 and `i` is 1 at the start of the loop.
