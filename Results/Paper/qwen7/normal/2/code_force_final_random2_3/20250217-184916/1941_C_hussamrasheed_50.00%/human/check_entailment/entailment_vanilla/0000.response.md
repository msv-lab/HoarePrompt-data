### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to make the string `s` beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. A string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".

2. **Current Implementation Analysis**:
   - The function counts the occurrences of the substring "map" in the string `s` and removes all instances of "map".
   - It then counts the occurrences of the substring "pie" in the modified string.
   - Finally, it prints the sum of these two counts.

3. **Issues Identified**:
   - **Incorrect Logic**: The logic used to determine the minimum deletions is flawed. Removing all instances of "map" and counting the remaining "pie" substrings does not guarantee the minimum deletions needed.
   - **Example Verification**:
     - For the string "mmapnapie":
       - Removing "map" results in "mnapie".
       - Counting "pie" in "mnapie" gives 1.
       - Output: 1 (but the correct answer should be 2, as deleting the 4th and 9th characters would result in "mmnapie").
     - For the string "mappppie":
       - Removing "map" results in "pppie".
       - Counting "pie" in "pppie" gives 1.
       - Output: 1 (but the correct answer should be 2, as deleting the 3rd and 8th characters would result in "mpppie").

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - Traverse the string and keep track of the last position where "map" or "pie" was found.
   - For each character, decide whether to include it based on the previous state (whether the last found substring was "map" or "pie").
   - This approach ensures that we only remove the necessary characters to avoid both "map" and "pie".

### Conclusion:
The current implementation is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
