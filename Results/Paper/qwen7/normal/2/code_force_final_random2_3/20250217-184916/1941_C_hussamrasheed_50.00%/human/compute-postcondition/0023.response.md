Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 1 (though `t` itself is not used in the print statement).
- `i` is explicitly defined as 2.
- `n` is an input integer (its value is not specified, but it is not needed for the print statement).
- `s` is the input string without the word 'map'.
- `m` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original `s`.
- `p` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.

The print statement is `print(m + p)`, which will output the sum of the number of occurrences of 'map' and 'pie' in the original string `s`.

Output: **m + p (where m is the number of occurrences of 'map' and p is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in the original string s)**
