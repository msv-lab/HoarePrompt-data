Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(t)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is the integer input by the user.
   - `s` is the string input by the user without any occurrence of 'map'.
   - `p` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < t`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` must become 2.
   - For `i` to become 2, `t` must remain greater than or equal to 2 (since `i` increments by 1 each iteration).

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `t`.

- `i` will be incremented from 1 to 2.
- `t` must still be greater than 1 (and therefore greater than or equal to 2).

So, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is the integer input by the user, `s` is the string input by the user without any occurrence of 'map', `p` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.**

However, since `t` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue, we can simplify this to:

**State: `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is the integer input by the user, `s` is the string input by the user without any occurrence of 'map', `p` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.**
