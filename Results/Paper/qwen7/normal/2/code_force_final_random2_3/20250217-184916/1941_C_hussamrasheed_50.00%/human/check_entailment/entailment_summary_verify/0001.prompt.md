You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        m = s.count('map')
        s = s.replace('map', '')
        p = s.count('pie')
        print(m + p)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and a string `s` (1 ≤ length of `s` ≤ 10^6). For each test case, it removes all occurrences of the substring 'map' from `s`, counts the remaining occurrences of 'pie', and prints the sum of the counts of 'map' and 'pie' from the original string `s`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to make the string `s` beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. A string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".

2. **Current Implementation Analysis**:
   - The function counts the occurrences of the substring "map" in the string `s` and removes all instances of "map".
   - It then counts the occurrences of the substring "pie" in the modified string.
   - Finally, it prints the sum of these two counts.

3. **Issues Identified**:
   - **Incorrect Logic**: The logic used to determine the minimum deletions is flawed. Removing all instances of "map" and counting the remaining "pie" substrings does not guarantee the minimum deletions needed.
   - **Example Verification**:
     - For the string "mmapnapie":
       - Removing "map" results in "mnapie".
       - Counting "pie" in "mnapie" gives 1.
       - Output: 1 (but the correct answer should be 2, as deleting the 4th and 9th characters would result in "mmnapie").
     - For the string "mappppie":
       - Removing "map" results in "pppie".
       - Counting "pie" in "pppie" gives 1.
       - Output: 1 (but the correct answer should be 2, as deleting the 3rd and 8th characters would result in "mpppie").

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - Traverse the string and keep track of the last position where "map" or "pie" was found.
   - For each character, decide whether to include it based on the previous state (whether the last found substring was "map" or "pie").
   - This approach ensures that we only remove the necessary characters to avoid both "map" and "pie".

### Conclusion:
The current implementation is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
