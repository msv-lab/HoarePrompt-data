Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `t`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the string input by the user without any occurrence of 'map', `m` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original `s`, `p` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will be equal to `t` (the total number of iterations), and for each iteration, the string `s` had all instances of 'map' removed, with `m` and `p` being the counts of 'map' and 'pie' in the original string `s`, respectively. The values of `t`, `n`, and the final state of `s` will reflect the last iteration's inputs and transformations.
