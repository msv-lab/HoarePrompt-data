Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all cases where the string contains the substrings "pie" or "map". Specifically, the program only counts the occurrences of "map" and removes them, but it does not account for overlapping instances of "pie" or "map". For example, in the input "mappie", the program would only remove one instance of "map" and one instance of "pie", resulting in "pie" still being present in the string. To fix this, the program needs to handle overlapping substrings more effectively.
