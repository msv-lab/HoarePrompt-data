Output State: `ans` is 6, `s` no longer contains the substring 'pi'.

Explanation: Given the loop continues as long as the substring 'pie' is found in `s`, and after each iteration, the substring 'pie' is removed from `s` and `ans` is incremented by 1, we can deduce the following:

- After 3 iterations, `s` contained the substring 'pi' and `ans` was 6.
- Since the loop condition checks for 'pie' and removes it, the loop would continue until 'pie' is no longer found in `s`.
- After the 3rd iteration, since the loop condition is still met (because `s` contains 'pi'), the loop would continue to the 4th iteration, removing 'pie' and incrementing `ans` to 7.
- This process would continue until 'pie' is no longer found in `s`.

Since the problem states that after 3 iterations, `s` still contained 'pi', and the loop would continue to remove 'pie' until it is no longer present, the final state would be that `s` no longer contains 'pie', and `ans` is 6, as the loop would stop after the 3rd iteration when it finds that 'pie' is no longer present in `s`. However, based on the provided information, it seems there might be a misunderstanding because the loop should stop once 'pie' is not found, but the given states suggest it continues. Assuming the correct behavior, the loop would stop after the 3rd iteration with `s` no longer containing 'pie'.
