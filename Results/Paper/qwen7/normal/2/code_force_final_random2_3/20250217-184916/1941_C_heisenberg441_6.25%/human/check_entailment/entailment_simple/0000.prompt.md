Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Example

    mapmapmapmapmapmap
    
    1
    
    p
    
    11
    
    pppiepieeee

Output

    2
    0
    2
    6
    0
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of s (denoted as n) satisfies 1 <= n <= 10^6.
def func_1(s):
    if (s == 'mapie') :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of s (denoted as n) satisfies 1 <= n <= 10^6, and s is not equal to 'mapie'
    ans = 0
    while s.find('map') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 2:]
        
        ans += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is 3, `s` is a string that no longer contains the substring 'map'.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as the substring 'map' is found in `s`. After each iteration, the substring 'map' is removed, and `ans` is incremented by 1. Since the loop stops when 'map' is no longer found in `s`, and we know that after 3 iterations, `s` no longer contains 'map', it means that the entire process of removing 'map' has been completed. Therefore, `ans` will be 3, indicating that the substring 'map' was found and removed 3 times, and `s` will be the final string without any occurrences of 'map'.
    while s.find('pie') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 2:]
        
        ans += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is 6, `s` no longer contains the substring 'pi'.
    #
    #Explanation: Given the loop continues as long as the substring 'pie' is found in `s`, and after each iteration, the substring 'pie' is removed from `s` and `ans` is incremented by 1, we can deduce the following:
    #
    #- After 3 iterations, `s` contained the substring 'pi' and `ans` was 6.
    #- Since the loop condition checks for 'pie' and removes it, the loop would continue until 'pie' is no longer found in `s`.
    #- After the 3rd iteration, since the loop condition is still met (because `s` contains 'pi'), the loop would continue to the 4th iteration, removing 'pie' and incrementing `ans` to 7.
    #- This process would continue until 'pie' is no longer found in `s`.
    #
    #Since the problem states that after 3 iterations, `s` still contained 'pi', and the loop would continue to remove 'pie' until it is no longer present, the final state would be that `s` no longer contains 'pie', and `ans` is 6, as the loop would stop after the 3rd iteration when it finds that 'pie' is no longer present in `s`. However, based on the provided information, it seems there might be a misunderstanding because the loop should stop once 'pie' is not found, but the given states suggest it continues. Assuming the correct behavior, the loop would stop after the 3rd iteration with `s` no longer containing 'pie'.
    return ans
    #The program returns 6, and the string `s` no longer contains the substring 'pi'.
