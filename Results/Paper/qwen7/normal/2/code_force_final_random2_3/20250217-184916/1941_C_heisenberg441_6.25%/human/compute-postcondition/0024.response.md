Output State: `ans` is 6, `s` no longer contains the substring 'pi'.

Explanation: Given the loop continues as long as the substring 'pie' is found in `s`, and after each iteration, the substring 'pie' is removed from `s` and `ans` is incremented by 1, we can deduce the following:

- After 3 iterations, `s` contained the substring 'pi' and `ans` was 6.
- Since the loop condition checks for 'pie' and removes it, the loop will continue until 'pie' is no longer found in `s`.
- After 3 more iterations (total 6 iterations), `s` will no longer contain 'pie', and `ans` will be incremented to 9.

However, based on the provided information and the loop logic, once the loop exits, `s` should no longer contain 'pie'. Therefore, the final state after all iterations would be `ans` is 6, and `s` no longer contains the substring 'pie'.
