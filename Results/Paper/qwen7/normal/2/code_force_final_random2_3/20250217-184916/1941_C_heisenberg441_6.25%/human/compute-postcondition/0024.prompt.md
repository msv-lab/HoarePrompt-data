Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `ans` is 3, `s` is a string that no longer contains the substring 'map'.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as the substring 'map' is found in `s`. After each iteration, the substring 'map' is removed, and `ans` is incremented by 1. Since the loop stops when 'map' is no longer found in `s`, and we know that after 3 iterations, `s` no longer contains 'map', it means that the entire process of removing 'map' has been completed. Therefore, `ans` will be 3, indicating that the substring 'map' was found and removed 3 times, and `s` will be the final string without any occurrences of 'map'.
Code of the loop:
while s.find('pie') != -1:
    s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 2:]
    ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans` is 4, `s` contains the substring 'pi'
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `ans` is 5, `s` contains the substring 'pi'
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `ans` is 6, `s` contains the substring 'pi'


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
