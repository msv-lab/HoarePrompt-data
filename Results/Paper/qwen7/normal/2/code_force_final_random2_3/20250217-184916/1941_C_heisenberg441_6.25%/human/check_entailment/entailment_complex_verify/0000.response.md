### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step using the annotated code and the provided examples.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the string `s` and the string `s` itself.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input.
   - It first checks if `s` is exactly "mapie". If true, it returns 1.
   - If `s` is not "mapie", it enters a loop to remove all occurrences of "map".
     - For each occurrence of "map", it removes "map" from `s` and increments `ans` by 1.
   - After removing all "map" occurrences, it enters another loop to remove all occurrences of "pie".
     - For each occurrence of "pie", it removes "pie" from `s` and increments `ans` by 1.
   - Finally, it returns the value of `ans`.

3. **Handling Overlapping Substrings:**
   - The function correctly handles overlapping substrings. For example, in the string "mapmap", it will remove one "map" and then the other "map", resulting in a total of 2 deletions, which is correct.
   - Similarly, for the string "mapmapmapmapmapmap", it will remove three "map" substrings, resulting in a total of 3 deletions, which is also correct.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles strings that do not contain "map" or "pie". For example, for the string "mathp", it will return 0.
   - The function also correctly handles strings that contain "pie" but no "map". For example, for the string "ppiee", it will return 2.

5. **Output Validation:**
   - The provided examples in the problem description match the expected output of the function. For instance:
     - "mmapnapie" requires 2 deletions ("mmap" and "pie").
     - "azabazapi" is already beautiful, so it requires 0 deletions.
     - "mappppie" requires 2 deletions ("map" and "pie").
     - "mapmapmapmapmapmap" requires 3 deletions ("map" three times).
     - "p" is already beautiful, so it requires 0 deletions.
     - "pppiepieeee" requires 2 deletions ("pie" twice).

Based on the above analysis, the function `func_1` correctly handles all cases, including overlapping substrings, and produces the correct output for all given examples.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The original assessment was inaccurate because the program correctly handles overlapping substrings and provides the correct output for all given examples.
