Output State: **`ans` is 5, `s` contains the substring 'pi'**

Explanation: The code replaces the substring 'pie' in `s` with nothing, effectively removing it. Since `s` originally contained the substring 'pie', after the operation, the part of `s` before 'pie' plus the part after 'pie' (excluding 'pie' itself) remains. This results in `s` now containing only 'pi'. The value of `ans` remains unchanged at 5.
