Output State: **`a` is the same list, `val` is the next element in `a`, `op` is updated by performing `^=` operation with `val >> i & 1`, `ai` is 0, `t` is [0]**.

Explanation: The code `op ^= val >> i & 1` updates the value of `op` by performing a bitwise XOR (`^`) operation with the result of `val >> i & 1`. Here, `val` is the next element in the list `a`, and `i` is `ai`, which is 0. So, the operation becomes `op ^= val >> 0 & 1`, which simplifies to `op ^= val & 1` because shifting a value by 0 bits does not change its value, and any number ANDed with 1 remains unchanged. This means `op` is updated by performing a bitwise XOR with the least significant bit of `val`. The other variables remain unchanged.
