Output State: `a` is a non-empty iterable, `op` is the result of XORing each `val` in `a` with `op` starting from the value it had before the loop, `cnt` is the total number of times `op` became 0 during the execution of the loop.

In more detail, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `op` will be the cumulative result of performing `op ^= val >> i & 1` for every `val` in the iterable `a`. The variable `cnt` will hold the count of how many times `op` turned from 1 to 0 throughout the loop's execution. The other variables (`t`, `ans`, `i`, `u`, `v`, and `val`) will retain their values from the last iteration of the loop, with `val` being the last element of `a` that was processed.
