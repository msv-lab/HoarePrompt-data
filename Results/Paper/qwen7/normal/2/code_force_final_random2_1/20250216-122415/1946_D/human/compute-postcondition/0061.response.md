Output State: **`a` is a non-empty iterable, `val` is the next element from `a`, `op` is updated by performing `op ^= val >> i & 1`, `cnt` is increased by 1 if `op` is false**

Explanation: The code snippet updates the variable `op` by performing a bitwise XOR operation (`^=`) between `op` and the result of `val >> i & 1`. Here, `val >> i & 1` shifts `val` right by `i` positions and then performs a bitwise AND with 1, which effectively checks the `i`-th bit of `val`. The value of `cnt` is increased by 1 only if `op` becomes false (i.e., `op` evaluates to 0). However, since the exact values of `a`, `val`, `op`, and `i` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact state of `op` and `cnt` after the operation. Thus, we maintain the general form of the output state as described.
