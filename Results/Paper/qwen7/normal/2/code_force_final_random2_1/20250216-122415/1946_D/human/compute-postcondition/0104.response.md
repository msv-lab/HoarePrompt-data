Output State: **`a` is a list with all its elements processed, `op` is the final result of the XOR operation on `val >> i & 1` for each `val` in `a`, `ai` is 0, `val` is no longer used, `t` is a list containing all the elements that satisfy the condition `not op`, which are the accumulated values of `ai` when `op` was 0.**

In this final state, `a` will have been fully iterated over. The variable `op` will hold the cumulative result of the XOR operation on `val >> i & 1` for each element `val` in `a`. Since `ai` is reset to 0 whenever `op` becomes 0, `t` will contain all the values of `ai` at those points, effectively collecting all the accumulated values of `ai` when `op` was 0 during the loop's iterations.
