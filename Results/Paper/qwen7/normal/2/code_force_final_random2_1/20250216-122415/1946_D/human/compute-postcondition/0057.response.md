Output State: **`a` is a non-empty iterable, `op` is updated by performing `op ^= val >> i & 1`, `cnt` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The line `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Since `a` is a non-empty iterable and `op` is updated by performing `op ^= val >> i & 1` (where `val` is the next element in the iterable `a`), these conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, `a` remains a non-empty iterable, `op` continues to be updated according to the given operation, and `cnt` is now one more than its previous value.
