Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `val` and `a`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - `val` is the current element being processed from the list `a`.
   - The loop performs an operation (`op ^= (val >> i & 1)`) where `i` starts at 0 and increments with each iteration.
   - After processing each element, `ai` is set to 0, indicating that the bit position `i` has been processed.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is the same list.
   - `val` is the next element in `a`.
   - `op` is updated by performing `^=` operation with `val >> i & 1`.
   - `ai` is 0.
   - `t` is `[0, 0]`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `ai` is 0, it means the current element `val` has just been processed, and the next bit position `i` to process is 1.
   - Therefore, `val` will be the next element in the list `a`.
   - `op` will be updated by performing `^=` operation with `val >> 1 & 1`.
   - `ai` will be updated to 1 to indicate that the bit position 1 has been processed.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `val` will be the next element in the list `a`.
   - `op` will be updated based on the new `val` and the bit position 1.
   - `ai` will be 1.
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` is the same list, `val` is the next element in `a`, `op` is updated by performing `^=` operation with `val >> 1 & 1`, `ai` is 1, `t` is [0, 0]**.
