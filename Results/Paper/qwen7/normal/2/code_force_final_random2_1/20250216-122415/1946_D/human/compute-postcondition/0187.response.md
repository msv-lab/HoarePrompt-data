Postcondition: `a` must contain at least one element, `val` is the second element of `a`, `op` is the result of `op` xor (`val` right-shifted by `i` bits and then bitwise ANDed with 1), and `cnt` is equal to 2 if `op` is false. If `op` is true, the values of `a`, `val`, `op`, and `cnt` remain unchanged from the precondition.
