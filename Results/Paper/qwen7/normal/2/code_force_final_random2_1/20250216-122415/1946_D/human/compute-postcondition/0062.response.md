Output State: **`a` is a non-empty iterable, `val` is the next element from `a`, `op` is updated by performing `op ^= val >> i & 1`, `cnt` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Since `a`, `val`, and `op` are not affected by this line of code, their states remain unchanged. The output state reflects these unchanged variables along with the updated count of `cnt`.
