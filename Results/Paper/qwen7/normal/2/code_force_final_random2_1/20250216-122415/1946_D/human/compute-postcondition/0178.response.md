Output State: **`a` must contain at least one element, `val` is the first element of `a`, `op` is the result of `op` xor (`val` right-shifted by `i` bits and then bitwise ANDed with 1)**.

Explanation: The operation `op ^= val >> i & 1` modifies the value of `op`. Here, `val >> i & 1` performs a bitwise right shift on `val` by `i` positions and then applies a bitwise AND with 1. This effectively extracts the `i`-th bit from `val`. The `^=` operator then performs a bitwise XOR between the current value of `op` and the extracted bit. The values of `a` and `val` remain unchanged, and `op` is updated accordingly.
