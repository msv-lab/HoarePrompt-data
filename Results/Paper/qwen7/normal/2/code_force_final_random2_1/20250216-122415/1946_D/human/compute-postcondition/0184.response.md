Output State: **`a` must contain at least one element, `val` is the second element of `a`, `op` is the result of `op` xor (`val` right-shifted by `i` bits and then bitwise ANDed with 1), and `cnt` is equal to 1**.

Explanation: The code `op ^= val >> i & 1` modifies the value of `op`. It performs a bitwise right shift on `val` by `i` bits, then performs a bitwise AND with 1, and finally XORs the result with `op`. Since the initial state of `op` is the result of `op` xor (`val` right-shifted by `i` bits and then bitwise ANDed with 1), the value of `op` changes according to this operation. However, the values of `a`, `val`, and `cnt` remain unchanged.
