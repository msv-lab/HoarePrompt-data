Postcondition: `t` is an empty list, `ans` is either -1 or the maximum of -1 and the number of times `op` became 0 during the loop, `i` is 2, `u` is either 0 or not 0, and `v` is even. Additionally, `v` remains unchanged and is either non-zero or zero if the loop or if-else block is exited. `cnt` retains its previous value, and `t`, `i`, `u`, and `v` also retain their previous values.
