Output State: **`op` is updated by performing `^=` operation with `val >> i & 1`.**

Explanation: The code `op ^= val >> i & 1` updates the value of `op` by performing a bitwise XOR (`^`) operation between `op` and the result of `val >> i & 1`. However, since the initial values of `op`, `val`, `i` are not specified, we can only describe the operation that occurs. The value of `val >> i & 1` is determined by right-shifting `val` by `i` positions and then performing a bitwise AND with 1, which effectively extracts the `i`-th bit of `val`. This result is then XORed with `op`. Therefore, the output state is that `op` has been updated according to this operation.
