Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for val in a:`. This means the loop iterates over each element in the list `a`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` must contain at least one element.
   - `val` is the first element of `a`.
   - `op` is the result of `op` xor (`val` right-shifted by `i` bits and then bitwise ANDed with 1).
   - `cnt` is equal to 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: For the loop to continue executing, `a` must contain at least one element. Since `val` is set to the first element of `a`, after the first iteration, `val` will be set to the second element of `a` (if it exists).

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `a` must still contain at least one element for the loop to continue.
   - `val` will now be the second element of `a` (since it was the first element in the previous iteration).
   - `op` and `cnt` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head and their values are not directly modified by the loop itself.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a` must contain at least one element, `val` is the second element of `a`, `op` is the result of `op` xor (`val` right-shifted by `i` bits and then bitwise ANDed with 1), and `cnt` is equal to 1**.
