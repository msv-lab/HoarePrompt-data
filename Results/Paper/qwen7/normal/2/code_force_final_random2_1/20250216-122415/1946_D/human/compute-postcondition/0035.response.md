Output State: **`a` is the same list, `val` is the next element in `a`, `op` is updated by performing `^=` operation with `val >> 1 & 1`, `ai` is `ai ^ val`, `t` is [0, 0, ai]**.

Explanation: The code snippet appends the value of `ai` to the list `t`. Initially, `t` is `[0, 0]`. After appending `ai`, `t` becomes `[0, 0, ai]`. The other variables (`a`, `val`, `op`, and `ai`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
