Output State: **`a` is the same list, `val` is the next element in `a`, `op` is updated by performing `^=` operation with `val >> i & 1`, `ai` is `ai ^ val`, `t` is [0]**.

Explanation: The code `ai ^= val` updates the value of `ai` by performing a bitwise XOR operation between `ai` and `val`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `val` is the next element in the list `a`, `ai` is updated to `ai ^ val`, and `op` is updated by performing the specified operation with `val >> i & 1`, but the exact value of `op` is not directly affected by this line of code. The list `a` and the list `t` remain unchanged.
