Output State: **`t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `u` is 0, `v` is truthy, `op` is 0, `cnt` is 0**

Explanation: The code initializes two new variables, `op` and `cnt`, both set to 0. The values of the other variables (`t`, `ans`, `i`, `u`, `v`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
