Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to solve the given problem. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It reads `n` and `x` for each test case.
   - It reads the array `a`.
3. **Main Logic**:
   - The program iterates over the bits from the most significant bit (29) to the least significant bit (0).
   - For each bit position, it checks the value of `x` at that bit (`u`) and the count of elements with that bit set in the array (`v`).
   - Depending on the values of `u` and `v`, it either skips further processing or performs specific operations to maximize the number of segments `k`.
   - If `u` is 0 and `v` is even, it processes the array to group elements with the same bit pattern.
   - If `u` is 0 and `v` is odd, it returns the current answer as no further segments can be formed.
   - If `u` is 1 and `v` is even, it counts the number of segments that can be formed.
   - If `u` is 1 and `v` is odd, it skips further processing.
   - If `u` is 1 and `v` is 0, it breaks out of the loop as no further segments can be formed.
4. **Final Answer**: The program returns the maximum number of segments `k` or -1 if no valid segments can be formed.

The logic appears to handle all the constraints and conditions specified in the problem statement accurately. Therefore, the provided program is correct.
