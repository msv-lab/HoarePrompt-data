Output State: **`a` must contain at least one element; `op` is updated by performing the bitwise XOR operation between `op` and the result of `val` right-shifted by `i` bits and then ANDed with 1.**

Explanation: The code `op ^= val >> i & 1` updates the value of `op`. It performs a bitwise right shift on `val` by `i` bits, then applies a bitwise AND with 1 to get the `i`-th bit of `val` (considering the least significant bit as the 0-th bit). This result is then XORed with `op`. The initial state of `a` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation.
