Output State: **`a` is the same list, `val` is the next element in `a`, `op` is updated by performing `^=` operation with `val >> 1 & 1`, `ai` is `ai ^ val`, `t` is [0, 0]**.

Explanation: The code `ai ^= val` updates the value of `ai` by performing the bitwise XOR (`^`) operation between `ai` and `val`. The other variables remain unchanged, so `val` remains as the next element in `a`, `op` is still updated by performing `^=` operation with `val >> 1 & 1`, and `t` remains as `[0, 0]`.
