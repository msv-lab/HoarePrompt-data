The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. The values of the variables remain the same as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 28, `u` is 0, `v` is the sum of `(val >> 28 & 1)` for each `val` in `a`.**
