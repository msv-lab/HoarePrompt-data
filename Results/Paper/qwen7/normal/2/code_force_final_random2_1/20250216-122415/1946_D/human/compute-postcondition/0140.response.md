Postcondition: `t` is an empty list, `ans` is either -1 or the maximum of -1 and the number of times `op` became 0 during the loop, `i` is 2, `u` is 0, and `v` is even. Since the condition `u == v == 0` is met in the if part, the postcondition remains unchanged as there are no modifications to the variables within the if block, and there is no else part to consider.
