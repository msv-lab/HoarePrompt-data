Output State: **`a` must be a non-empty iterable, `op` is updated by performing `op ^= val >> i & 1`, where `val` is shifted right by `i` bits, masked with 1, and then XORed with `op`.**

Explanation: The code `op ^= val >> i & 1` updates the value of `op` by performing a bitwise XOR operation between `op` and the result of `val >> i & 1`. Here, `val` is shifted right by `i` bits, then ANDed with 1 (which effectively extracts the `i`-th bit of `val`), and finally XORed with `op`. The initial values of `a` and `val` are not specified, and `i` is also not defined, so the exact new value of `op` cannot be determined without these values. However, we know that `op` is updated according to the given operation.
