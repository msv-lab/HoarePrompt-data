Output State: **`a` must contain at least two elements, `val` is the third element of `a`, `op` is the result of `op` XOR (`val` right-shifted by `i` bits and then ANDed with 1), and `cnt` is the same as the previous iteration.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `op` by performing a bitwise XOR operation between `op` and the result of right-shifting `val` by `i` bits and then performing a bitwise AND with 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous values.
