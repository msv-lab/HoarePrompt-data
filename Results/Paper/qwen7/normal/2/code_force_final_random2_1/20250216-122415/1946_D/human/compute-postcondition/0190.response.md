Output State: **`a` must contain at least two elements, `val` is the third element of `a`, `op` is the result of `op` XOR (`val` right-shifted by `i` bits and then ANDed with 1), and `cnt` is `cnt` + 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
