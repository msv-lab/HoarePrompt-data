Output State: `a` is a non-empty iterable, `op` is the result of XORing `val >> i & 1` for each `val` in `a`, `cnt` is the count of times `op` became 0 during the iterations of the loop.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `a` will still be the original non-empty iterable. The variable `op` will hold the result of performing the XOR operation on `val >> i & 1` for every element `val` in `a`. The variable `cnt` will store the total number of times `op` turned false (0) throughout the loop's execution.
