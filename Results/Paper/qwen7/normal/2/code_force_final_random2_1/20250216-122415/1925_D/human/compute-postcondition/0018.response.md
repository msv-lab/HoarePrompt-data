Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` is the exact number of times the loop ran, `a` is the value from the last iteration, `b` is the value from the last iteration, `f` is the value from the last iteration, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values entered during the loop executions, `j` is `m-1` (the last iteration index), `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`, `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2` using the value of `n` from the last iteration, `q` is `2 * cn2 ** 2`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `q` as `2 * cn2 ** 2`, where `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`. Since `cn2` is already defined in terms of `n`, `q` is computed based on the value of `n` from the last iteration. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
