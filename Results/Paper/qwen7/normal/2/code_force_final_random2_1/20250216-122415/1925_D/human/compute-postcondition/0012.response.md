Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `sum_f` is `sum_f + f`, `j` is 2, `a` is the first integer from input, `b` is the second integer from input, `f` is the third integer from input.**

Explanation: The code snippet reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `f`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `i`, `m`, `sum_f`, `j`) remain unchanged. The new values of `a`, `b`, and `f` are the integers provided by the input.
