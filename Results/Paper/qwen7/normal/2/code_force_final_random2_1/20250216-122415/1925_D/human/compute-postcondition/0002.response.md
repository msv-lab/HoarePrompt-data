State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains two variables: `i` and `t`.
   - `i` is the loop variable that starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - `t` is the upper limit of the loop, which determines how many times the loop will run.

2. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, the condition `i < t` must hold true in the first iteration.
   - When `i` is 0, the condition `0 < t` must be true for the loop to start.

3. **Initial Values**: Given that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\), it means `t` must be a positive integer. Therefore, `t` must be greater than 0.
   - Initially, `i` is set to 0.

4. **Adjusting States**: To ensure the loop can start, we need to adjust the state of `t` to be greater than 0 and set `i` to 0.

Thus, the final state to be adjusted is:
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 0

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
