Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `sum_f` is `sum_f + f`, `j` is 1**

The code `sum_f += f` increments `sum_f` by the value of `f`. Since `f` is an input integer, `sum_f` now holds the value of its previous value plus `f`. All other variables remain unchanged.
