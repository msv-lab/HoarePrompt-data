Output State: **`j` is equal to `m-1`, `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `sum_f` is the sum of all input integers `f` from each iteration of the loop, `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2` where `n` is an input integer, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`**.

This output state reflects that the variable `p` has been assigned the value `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`. All other variables retain their initial conditions as described in the initial state.
