Output State: **`gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`; `m` must be greater than 0; `a` is an input integer; `b` is an input integer; `sum_f` is 0; `j` is `m`; `f` is the last integer from the input in the final iteration; `a` is the first integer from the input in the final iteration; `b` is the second integer from the input in the final iteration; `p` is equal to `p // gcd`; `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`; `q` is `q // gcd`; `i` is `i + 1` and `n`, `m`, `k` are assigned the values from the input split into three integers.**

Explanation: The line `sum_f = 0` sets `sum_f` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
