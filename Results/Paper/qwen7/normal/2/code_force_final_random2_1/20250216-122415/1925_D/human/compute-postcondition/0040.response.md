Output State: **`gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`; `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `sum_f` is equal to the sum of all `f` values entered over all iterations, `j` is `m`, `f` is the last integer from the input in the final iteration, `a` is the first integer from the input in the final iteration, `b` is the second integer from the input in the final iteration, `p` is calculated as `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`, `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `q` is `2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2)**

Explanation: The `math.gcd` function calculates the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`. The values of `m`, `a`, `b`, `sum_f`, `j`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `p`, `cn2`, and `q` remain unchanged. The new variable `gcd` is introduced with its value being the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.
