The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `m`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, and `m` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. Additionally, `m` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`j` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0**
