Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to the total number of iterations the loop executed, `a` is an input integer from the last iteration, `b` is an input integer from the last iteration, `f` is an input integer from the last iteration, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values entered during the loop executions, `j` is `m-1` (the last iteration index), `sum_f` is increased by the `f` value from the last iteration.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` remains greater than 0, `i` remains 0, `m` must be the exact number of times the loop ran, `a`, `b`, and `f` are the values from the last iteration of the loop, `sum_f` contains the total sum of all `f` values entered as the loop ran, `j` is the index of the last iteration (one less than `m`), and `sum_f` reflects the cumulative addition of all `f` values.
