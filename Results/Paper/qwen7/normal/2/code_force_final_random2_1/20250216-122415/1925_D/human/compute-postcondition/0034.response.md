Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `sum_f` is equal to `sum_f` plus `f`, `j` is `m + 1`, `f` is the third integer from the input, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, `sum_f` is updated by adding `f` to its current value, `sum_f` is now equal to the previous value of `sum_f` plus `f`.**

In this case, the code updates the value of `sum_f` by adding the value of `f` to it. All other variables remain unchanged. The updated value of `sum_f` is the sum of its previous value and `f`.
