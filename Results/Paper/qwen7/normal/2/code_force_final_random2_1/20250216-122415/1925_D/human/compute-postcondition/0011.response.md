Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `j in range(m)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `m`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `m` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is an input integer.
   - `f` is an input integer.
   - `sum_f` is `sum_f + f`.
   - `j` is 1.

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `j < m`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `m`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `j` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `m` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `t` must still be greater than 0.
   - `i` remains 0.
   - `m` remains greater than or equal to 1.
   - `a` remains an input integer.
   - `b` remains an input integer.
   - `f` remains an input integer.
   - `sum_f` remains `sum_f + f`.
   - `j` is now 2.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `sum_f` is `sum_f + f`, `j` is 2**
