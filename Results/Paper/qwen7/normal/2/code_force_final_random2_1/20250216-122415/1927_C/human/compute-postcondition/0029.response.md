Output State: **`only_a` is updated to contain all elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`; `only_b` remains unchanged; `total_distinct` remains unchanged; `unique_a` remains unchanged; `n` remains unchanged; `m` remains unchanged; `k` remains unchanged; `a` remains unchanged; `b` remains unchanged; `unique_b` remains unchanged; `relevant_a` remains unchanged; `relevant_b` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates the set `only_a` to contain all elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`. This operation does not affect the other variables, so their states remain unchanged.
