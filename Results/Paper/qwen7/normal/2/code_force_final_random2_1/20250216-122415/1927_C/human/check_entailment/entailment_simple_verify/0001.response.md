### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires checking if it's possible to select exactly \( \frac{k}{2} \) elements from two arrays `a` and `b` such that all integers from 1 to \( k \) are included among the chosen elements.

2. **Key Points**:
   - We need to ensure that we can pick at least \( \frac{k}{2} \) distinct elements from each array.
   - We need to cover all integers from 1 to \( k \).

3. **Analysis of the Given Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the input and stores the test cases.
   - It defines a function `func_1` to process each test case.
   - For each test case, it:
     - Converts arrays `a` and `b` into sets (`unique_a` and `unique_b`) to get unique elements.
     - Filters out elements greater than \( k \) from these sets.
     - Identifies elements that are unique to `a` and `b` and those present in both.
     - Checks if the count of unique elements in either array exceeds \( \frac{k}{2} \).
     - Ensures the total count of distinct elements across both arrays is at least \( k \).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge cases where more than \( \frac{k}{2} \) elements are unique to one array.
   - It ensures the total distinct elements cover all numbers from 1 to \( k \).

5. **Output**:
   - The function returns a list of results for each test case, indicating "YES" or "NO".

6. **Detailed Analysis Using Annotations**:
   - **State before the function call**: `t` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \). For each test case, `cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers \( (n, m, k) \) representing the lengths of arrays `a` and `b`, and the number of elements to be chosen, respectively. Arrays `a` and `b` are represented as lists of integers, where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 \) and \( 2 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot \min(n, m) \), with \( k \) being even. Additionally, it is guaranteed that the sum of values \( n \) and \( m \) over all test cases in a test does not exceed \( 4 \cdot 10^5 \).
   - **State inside the function**: 
     - `unique_a` and `unique_b` are sets containing unique elements from arrays `a` and `b`, respectively.
     - `relevant_a` and `relevant_b` are sets containing elements from `unique_a` and `unique_b` that are less than or equal to \( k \).
     - `only_a` and `only_b` are sets containing elements that are unique to `a` and `b`, respectively.
     - `both` is a set containing elements that are common to both `a` and `b`.
     - The code checks if the count of elements in `only_a` or `only_b` exceeds \( \frac{k}{2} \). If so, it appends 'NO' to the results list and continues to the next test case.
     - The code then checks if the total number of distinct elements in `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both` is at least \( k \). If not, it appends 'NO' to the results list and continues to the next test case.
     - If neither condition is met, it appends 'YES' to the results list.

7. **Validation of the Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the code handles the problem requirements.
   - The code correctly filters out elements greater than \( k \) and ensures the total distinct elements cover all numbers from 1 to \( k \).
   - The logic for checking if more than \( \frac{k}{2} \) elements are unique to one array and ensuring the total distinct elements cover all numbers from 1 to \( k \) is sound.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment accurately describes the functionality and correctness of the provided code. The code correctly implements the requirements of the problem and handles all necessary edge cases.

**Final: True**
