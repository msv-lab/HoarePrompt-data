Output State: **`results` now contains 'NO', `total_distinct` remains unchanged, `unique_a` is a set containing the elements of `a`, `unique_b` is now a set containing the elements of `b`, `relevant_a` remains unchanged, `relevant_b` remains unchanged, and `both` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `unique_b = set(b)` creates a new set `unique_b` that contains the unique elements of the list `b`. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
