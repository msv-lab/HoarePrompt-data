The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the initial state, and the `continue` statement does not affect variables outside of a loop, the variables remain unchanged. The `results` list is still ['NO'], and the other variables (`only_a`, `only_b`, `total_distinct`) also remain as they were.

Output State: **`results` is ['NO'], `only_a` is a set containing all elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set containing all elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`, `total_distinct` is assigned the value of the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`.**
