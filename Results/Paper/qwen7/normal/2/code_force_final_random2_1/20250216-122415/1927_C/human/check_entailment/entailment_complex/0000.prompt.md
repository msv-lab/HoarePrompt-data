Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Given an array a of n integers, an array b of m integers, and an even number k
.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to choose exactly \frac{k}{2}
elements from both arrays in such a way that among the chosen elements, every
integer from 1 to k is included.

For example:

  * If a=[2, 3, 8, 5, 6, 5] , b=[1, 3, 4, 10, 5] , k=6 , then it is possible to choose elements with values 2, 3, 6 from array a and elements with values 1, 4, 5 from array b . In this case, all numbers from 1 to k=6 will be included among the chosen elements.
  * If a=[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5] , b=[1, 3, 8, 10, 3] , k=6 , then it is not possible to choose elements in the required way. 

Note that you are not required to find a way to choose the elements — your
program should only check whether it is possible to choose the elements in the
required way.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n, m \le 2\cdot10^5 , 2 \le k \le 2 \cdot \min(n, m) , k is even) — the length
of array a , the length of array b , and the number of elements to be chosen,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_j \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n and m over all test cases in a test
does not exceed 4 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to choose \frac{k}{2} numbers from
each array in such a way that among the chosen elements, every integer from 1
to k is included. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Output

    YES

Note

In the first test case of the example, it is possible to choose elements equal
to 2 , 3 , and 6 from array a and elements equal to 1 , 4 , and 5 from array b
. Thus, all numbers from 1 to k=6 are included among the chosen elements.

In the second test case of the example, it can be shown that it is not
possible to choose exactly three elements from each array in the required way.

In the third test case of the example, it is possible to choose elements equal
to 1 and 3 from array a and elements equal to 2 and 4 from array b . Thus, all
numbers from 1 to k=4 are included among the chosen elements.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, m, k) representing the lengths of arrays a and b, and the number of elements to be chosen, respectively. Arrays a and b are represented as lists of integers, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅min(n, m), with k being even. Additionally, it is guaranteed that the sum of values n and m over all test cases in a test does not exceed 4⋅10^5.

    #State: Output State: The `results` list will contain either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop. Specifically, for each test case (n, m, k, a, b):
    #
    #- If more than half of the elements in `only_a` or `only_b` exist (i.e., their counts exceed `k // 2`), the result for that test case will be 'NO'.
    #- If the total number of distinct elements in `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both` is less than `k`, the result for that test case will also be 'NO'.
    #- Otherwise, the result for that test case will be 'YES'.
    #
    #All other variables (`unique_a`, `unique_b`, `relevant_a`, `relevant_b`, `both`, `only_a`, `only_b`) will be recalculated for each test case but will not persist outside the current iteration. The final `results` list will include the outcome ('YES' or 'NO') for every test case processed by the loop.
    #
    #In summary, the `results` list will contain the outcome for each test case after all iterations of the loop have completed, with no additional variables persisting beyond their scope within the loop.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of strings, either 'YES' or 'NO', for each test case processed by the loop. Each entry in the list is determined based on whether more than half of the elements in `only_a` or `only_b` exist (i.e., their counts exceed `k // 2`), or if the total number of distinct elements in `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both` is less than `k`. If neither condition is met, the entry is 'YES'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list of test cases, each containing the lengths of two arrays (a and b) and the number of elements to choose (k). For each test case, it determines if the chosen elements meet specific criteria. If more than half of the elements in either array a or b exceed k/2, or if the total number of distinct elements is less than k, the result is 'NO'. Otherwise, the result is 'YES'. The function returns a list of these results, one for each test case.
