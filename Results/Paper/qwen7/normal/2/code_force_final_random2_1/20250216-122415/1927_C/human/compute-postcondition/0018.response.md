Output State: **`results` is a list containing 'NO', `only_a` is a set containing all elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`, and `only_b` is a set containing all elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`. If the length of `only_b` is greater than `k // 2`, then `only_b` is updated to contain only those elements whose length is greater than `k // 2`. The variable `total_distinct` is assigned the value of the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`.**

This output state reflects that the code calculates the total number of distinct elements across `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both` sets and assigns this value to `total_distinct`. The conditions and sets (`only_a`, `only_b`) remain unchanged unless the specified condition for updating `only_b` is met.
