Output State: **`results` now contains 'NO', 'NO'; `total_distinct` remains unchanged; `unique_a` is a set containing the elements of `a`; `unique_b` is now a set containing the elements of `b`; `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`; `relevant_b` is now a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`; `both` is the intersection of `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`; `only_a` is a set containing elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`; `only_b` is a set containing elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'NO'` to the list `results`. This means that the list `results` now contains two elements: `'NO'` (previously present) and another `'NO'`. All other variables remain unchanged with their respective states.
