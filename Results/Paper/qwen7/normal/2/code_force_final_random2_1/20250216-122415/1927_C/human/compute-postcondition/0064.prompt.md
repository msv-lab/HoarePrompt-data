Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, m, k) representing the lengths of arrays a and b, and the number of elements to be chosen, respectively. Arrays a and b are represented as lists of integers, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅min(n, m), with k being even. Additionally, it is guaranteed that the sum of values n and m over all test cases in a test does not exceed 4⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for n, m, k, a, b in cases:
    unique_a = set(a)
    unique_b = set(b)
    relevant_a = {x for x in unique_a if x <= k}
    relevant_b = {x for x in unique_b if x <= k}
    only_a = relevant_a - relevant_b
    only_b = relevant_b - relevant_a
    both = relevant_a & relevant_b
    if len(only_a) > k // 2:
        results.append('NO')
        continue
    if len(only_b) > k // 2:
        results.append('NO')
        continue
    total_distinct = len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both)
    if total_distinct < k:
        results.append('NO')
        continue
    results.append('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `results` is a list containing 'NO', 'YES', `only_a` is a set containing all elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set containing all elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`, and `total_distinct` is assigned the value of the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `results` now contains 'NO', 'YES', `total_distinct`, `unique_a`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `unique_b`, `relevant_a`, `relevant_b`, and `both` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `results` now contains 'NO', 'YES'; `total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`; `unique_a` is a set containing the elements of `a`; `unique_b` is a set containing the elements of `b`; `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`; `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`; `both` is the intersection of `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`; `only_a` is a set containing elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`; `only_b` is a set containing elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
