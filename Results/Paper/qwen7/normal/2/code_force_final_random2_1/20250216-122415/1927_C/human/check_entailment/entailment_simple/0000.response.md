Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly parses the input and stores the test cases in a list of tuples.
2. The `func_1` function processes each test case according to the problem statement.
3. It calculates the sets of unique elements in arrays `a` and `b` that are less than or equal to `k`.
4. It then determines the number of elements that are exclusive to `a` (`only_a`), exclusive to `b` (`only_b`), and common to both (`both`).
5. The function checks if more than half of the elements in `only_a` or `only_b` exist, which would make it impossible to select exactly `k/2` elements from each array. If this condition is met, it appends 'NO' to the results list.
6. It also checks if the total number of distinct elements in `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both` is less than `k`, which would also make it impossible to select the required elements. If this condition is met, it appends 'NO' to the results list.
7. If neither of these conditions is met, it appends 'YES' to the results list.
8. The logic appears to be correct and aligns with the problem requirements.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
