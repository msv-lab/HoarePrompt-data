Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is iterating over the elements in the list `costs`.

2. **Determine the initial values of the variables**:
   - `h` is calculated as `0 + (n - k + 1) + curr`.
   - `n` is updated to `n - i * curr`.
   - `k` is a positive integer.
   - `costs` is a list containing one element: `1`.
   - `curr` is `n // i`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in the list `costs` to iterate over.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is taken from the list `costs`, and `costs` contains only one element (`1`), `i` will be `1` for each iteration.
   - After the first iteration, `n` will be updated to `n - 1 * curr`.
   - `h` will be recalculated based on the new value of `n`.
   - `curr` will be updated to `n // i` (which will still be `1` since `i` is `1`).

5. **Update the states**:
   - `i` will be `1` (the only element in `costs`).
   - `n` will be updated to `n - curr` (since `curr` is `n // i` and `i` is `1`).
   - `h` will be recalculated based on the new `n`.
   - `curr` will remain `1` until `n` changes.

Given this, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`h` is `0 + (n - k + 1) + 1`, `n` is `n - 1 * curr`, `k` is a positive integer, `costs` is a list containing one element: `1`, `curr` is `1`**
