Output State: **`h` is `0 + (n - k + 1) + curr`, `n` is `n - i * curr`, `k` is a positive integer, `costs` is a list containing one element: `1`, `curr` is `n // i`**

Explanation: The code `n -= i * curr` subtracts `i * curr` from `n`. The values of `h`, `k`, `costs`, and `curr` remain unchanged. Therefore, `h` remains as `0 + (n - k + 1) + curr`, `n` is updated to `n - i * curr`, and `curr` stays as `n // i`.
