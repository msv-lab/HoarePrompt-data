Output State: `h` is the sum of all `curr` values calculated during the loop iterations, `n` is reduced to a non-positive value (since it keeps decreasing by `i * curr` in each iteration until it becomes zero or negative), `k` is a positive integer, `costs` is a list containing one element: `1`.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `h` will be the total of all `curr` values calculated during each iteration, `n` will be reduced to zero or a negative number (depending on the values of `i` and `curr`), `k` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop, `costs` will be left with a single element `1` after the first element is consumed in the loop iterations.
