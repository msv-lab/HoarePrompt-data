Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, n and k, both of which are positive integers between 1 and 10^18. If n equals k, it prints 'YES' followed by 1 twice and returns k. If n is less than k, it prints 'NO' and returns None. If n is greater than or equal to k, it calculates the sum of certain values and prints 'NO' if this sum is less than k. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', 2, 'YES' again, and the list [1]. Regardless of the case, the function returns None.**
