Postcondition: `k` is 0, `heap` contains elements popped from `combined` during the loop's iterations if `combined` was not empty, `max_profit` is now equal to either `current_profit - item[1]` if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0` or `current_profit + item[0]` if `item[0] + item[1] < 0`, `combined` is now one item smaller, and `item` is the last element popped from `combined`.
