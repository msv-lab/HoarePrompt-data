Postcondition: `combined` is now a list without its last element; `item` is the last element of the original `combined` list; `removed_item` is the smallest element pushed into the heap; if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, then `current_profit` remains unchanged and `max_profit` is updated to be equal to `current_profit`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is reduced by the first value of `removed_item`.
