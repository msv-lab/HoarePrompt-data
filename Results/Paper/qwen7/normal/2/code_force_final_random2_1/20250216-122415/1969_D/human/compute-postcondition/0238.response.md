Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter t, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two positive integers n and k, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n. It also accepts two lists, prices and bonuses, each containing n integers representing the prices for Alice (a_i) and Bob (b_i), respectively. The function does not return anything explicitly based on the given information.**
