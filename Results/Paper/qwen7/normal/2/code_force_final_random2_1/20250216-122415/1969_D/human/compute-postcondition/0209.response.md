Postcondition: `combined` is now a list without its last element; `item` is the last element of the original `combined` list; `removed_item` is the smallest element pushed into the heap; `current_profit` is equal to `max_profit`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit` before the if statement, `max_profit` remains unchanged; otherwise, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`.
