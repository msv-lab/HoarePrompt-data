Output State: **`k` is 0, `heap` contains elements popped from `combined` during the loop's iterations, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`, and the values of `max_profit`, `test_cases`, `t`, `remaining_items`, `neg_prices`, `n`, and `bonuses` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `current_profit = func_3(combined, heap)` assigns the value returned by the function `func_3(combined, heap)` to the variable `current_profit`. The values of `k` and `heap` are updated based on the loop's iterations, and the elements popped from `combined` are stored in `heap`. The other variables (`max_profit`, `test_cases`, `t`, `remaining_items`, `neg_prices`, `n`, and `bonuses`) are not affected by this line of code.
