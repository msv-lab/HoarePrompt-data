Output State: **`combined` is an empty list, `max_profit` holds the highest value of `current_profit` encountered during the loop's execution, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `t` remains unchanged, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` remains an empty list, and `current_profit` is 0 since `combined` is now empty.**

Explanation: The line `heap = []` initializes the `heap` variable as an empty list. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
