Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `while combined:`. This means the loop continues as long as `combined` is not empty.

2. **Understand the Loop Body**: The loop body is omitted, but we know from the postcondition that:
   - `combined` becomes one item shorter.
   - `item` is the last element of `combined` before it was popped.
   - `heap` contains the new item.
   - `current_profit` is adjusted based on the conditions given.
   - `max_profit` is set to the value of `current_profit`.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to continue, `combined` must still contain at least one item. Therefore, `combined` cannot be empty at the start of the next iteration.
   - Since `combined` is one item shorter after each iteration, the loop can continue as long as `combined` has at least one item left.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `combined` to ensure it is not empty.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`combined` must not be empty**
