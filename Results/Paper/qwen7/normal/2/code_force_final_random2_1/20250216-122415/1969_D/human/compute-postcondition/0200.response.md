Postcondition: `combined` is now a list without its last element, `item` is the last element of the original `combined` list, and if the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, `current_profit` is reduced by the last element's second value of the original `combined` list. Otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by the first element of `item`.
