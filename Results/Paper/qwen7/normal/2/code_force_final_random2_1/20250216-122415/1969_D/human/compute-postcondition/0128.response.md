Output State: **`k` is 0, `heap` contains the new item after pushing and popping, `max_profit` is now equal to either `current_profit - item[1]` if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0` or `current_profit + item[0]` if `item[0] + item[1] < 0`, `combined` is now one item smaller, `item` is the last element popped from `combined`, `current_profit` is reduced by `removed_item[0]`**.

This means that the current profit (`current_profit`) has been decreased by the value of `removed_item[0]`. All other variables retain their previous states as described in the initial state, with the exception of `current_profit`, which now reflects the subtraction of `removed_item[0]`.
