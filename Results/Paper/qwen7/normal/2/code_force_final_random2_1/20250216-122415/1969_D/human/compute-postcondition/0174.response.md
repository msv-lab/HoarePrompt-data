State: **`combined` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order, `bonuses` is a list containing the results of `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `_` is now 1** 

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `_` is used as a placeholder and typically does not require explicit adjustment since its purpose is to control the number of iterations.
- The loop condition `range(k)` means the loop will run `k` times. Therefore, `k` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
- No other variables or lists need to be explicitly adjusted because they are not part of the loop head and their state does not directly affect the loop's execution.

Thus, the key state to adjust is that `k` must be greater than 0.
