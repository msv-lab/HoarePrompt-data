The function processes a series of test cases defined by an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, it reads integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n), and two lists a and b, each containing n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9). After processing these inputs, the function returns an integer t such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
