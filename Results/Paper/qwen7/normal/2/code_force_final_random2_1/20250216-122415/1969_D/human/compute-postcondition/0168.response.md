Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `max_profit` is the highest profit achieved during any iteration of the loop, `current_profit` is the final profit after processing all items, `k` is 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `neg_prices` which contains the negative values of each element in the list `prices`. The original variables `heap`, `max_profit`, `current_profit`, `k`, `remaining_items`, and `prices` remain unchanged in their values or states.
