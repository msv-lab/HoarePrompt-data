Postcondition: `combined` is now one item shorter, `item` is the last element of `combined` before it was popped, `heap` contains the new item, `current_profit` is decreased by the second element of the last item of the original `combined` if the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `current_profit` is increased by the first element of `item`, and `current_profit` is further adjusted by the first element of `removed_item`; `max_profit` is set to the value of `current_profit`.
