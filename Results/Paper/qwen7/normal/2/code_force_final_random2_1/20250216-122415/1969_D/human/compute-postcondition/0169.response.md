Output State: **`bonuses` is a list containing the results of `func_2()`, `max_profit` is the highest profit achieved during any iteration of the loop, `current_profit` is the final profit after processing all items, `k` is 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`.**

Explanation: The line `bonuses = list(func_2())` creates a new list called `bonuses` by calling the function `func_2()` and converting its result into a list. The other variables (`max_profit`, `current_profit`, `k`, `remaining_items`, and `neg_prices`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
