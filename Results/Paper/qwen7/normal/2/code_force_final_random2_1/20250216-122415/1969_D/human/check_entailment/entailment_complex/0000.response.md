Reasoning:
1. **Function Definitions and Inputs**: The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` are correctly defined and process the necessary inputs as described in the problem statement.
2. **Heap Usage**: The use of a min-heap (`heapq`) in `func_4` to manage the items that Bob might take for free is appropriate and aligns with the problem requirements.
3. **Profit Calculation**: The logic in `func_4` for calculating Alice's profit is sound. It correctly handles the scenarios where Bob takes items for free or purchases additional items from Alice.
4. **Optimal Strategy**: The strategy implemented in `func_4` ensures that Alice maximizes her profit and Bob minimizes it, as required by the problem.
5. **Edge Cases**: The code handles edge cases such as when `k` is 0, ensuring that Alice's profit is calculated correctly in those scenarios.
6. **Test Case Processing**: The function iterates over all test cases and prints the maximum profit for each, which is consistent with the problem requirements.

Given the above analysis, the provided implementation appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
