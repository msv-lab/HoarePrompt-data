Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `max_profit` is the highest profit achieved during any iteration of the loop, `current_profit` is the final profit after processing all items, `k` remains 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, and the values of `test_cases`, `t`, `neg_prices`, `n`, and `bonuses` remain unchanged.**

The code initializes `remaining_items` as an empty list, which updates the state of the variable `remaining_items`. All other variables retain their initial states as described in the precondition.
