Output State: **`k` is 0, `heap` contains the new item after pushing and popping, `max_profit` is reassigned to `current_profit`, `combined` must contain at least one item less than before, `removed_item` is now equal to the last element popped from `combined`, `current_profit` is increased by `item[0]`**

Explanation: The code `current_profit += item[0]` increases the value of `current_profit` by the value of `item[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
