Output State: **`combined` has at least one element less than before; `current_profit` is reduced by the second element of the last element of `combined` before popping; `item` is the last element of `combined` before popping.**

Explanation: The code subtracts the second element (index 1) of the last element of `combined` from `current_profit`. After this operation, `combined` has at least one element less than before, and `item` remains the last element of `combined` before the pop operation.
