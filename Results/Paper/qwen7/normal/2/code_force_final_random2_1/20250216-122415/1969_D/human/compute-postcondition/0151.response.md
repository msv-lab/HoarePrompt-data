Output State: **`k` is 0, `heap` contains the new item after pushing and popping, `max_profit` is reassigned to `current_profit`, `combined` must contain at least one item less than before, `removed_item` is now equal to the last element popped from `combined`, `current_profit` is adjusted by subtracting `item[1]`**

Explanation: The code `current_profit -= item[1]` subtracts the value of `item[1]` from `current_profit`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
