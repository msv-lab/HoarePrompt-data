### Reasoning:

Let's break down the solution step-by-step to ensure it meets the requirements of the problem statement.

1. **Input Processing**:
   - The `func_1` function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - The `func_2` function correctly reads pairs of integers `n` and `k`, and the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Heap and Remaining Items Initialization**:
   - The `func_4` function initializes a min-heap (`heap`) and a list (`remaining_items`) to store items that are not taken for free.
   - It converts the prices `a` into negative values (`neg_prices`) to facilitate the heap operations (since Python's `heapq` is a min-heap).

3. **Sorting and Initial Heap Operations**:
   - The combined list of items (negative prices and bonuses) is sorted based on the bonus value.
   - The first `k` items are pushed into the heap, ensuring that the most beneficial items are considered for free.

4. **Profit Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the initial profit using the `func_3` function.
   - It then iterates through the remaining items, adjusting the profit based on whether taking an item for free or paying for it is more beneficial.
   - The `func_3` function sums up the appropriate values based on the conditions provided.

5. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The strategy ensures that Alice maximizes her profit by considering the most beneficial items for free and paying for the least beneficial ones.
   - The use of a heap allows efficient management of the items to be taken for free.

Given the detailed breakdown and the execution summaries, the function appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Each part of the solution aligns with the problem statement and the provided execution summaries.

### Conclusion:

The given program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
