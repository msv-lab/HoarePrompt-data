Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, t is the length of test_cases, heap is an empty list, prices and bonuses remain unchanged.**

The code initializes an empty list named `heap`. This does not affect the values of `test_cases`, `t`, `prices`, or `bonuses`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
