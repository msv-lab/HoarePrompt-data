Postcondition: **`combined` is an empty list, `heap` contains all the tuples that were popped from `combined` during the iterations, `max_profit` is now equal to `current_profit`, which is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`, `k` is 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`.**
