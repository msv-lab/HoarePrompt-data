Output State: **`combined` is now one item shorter, `item` is the last element of `combined` before it was popped, `heap` contains the new item, `current_profit` is decreased by the second element of the last item of the original `combined` if the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `current_profit` is increased by the first element of `item`, `current_profit` is decreased by the first element of `removed_item`.**

Explanation: The code `current_profit -= removed_item[0]` decreases `current_profit` by the first element of `removed_item`. The other variables (`combined`, `item`, `heap`) remain unchanged from their previous states. The condition regarding `current_profit` being decreased by the second element of the last item of the original `combined` or increased by the first element of `item` remains the same.
