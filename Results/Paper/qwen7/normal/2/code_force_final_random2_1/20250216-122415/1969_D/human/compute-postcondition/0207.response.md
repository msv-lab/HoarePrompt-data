Output State: **`combined` is now a list without its last element; `item` is the last element of the original `combined` list; `removed_item` is the smallest element pushed into the heap; `current_profit` is equal to `max_profit`; `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`.**

Explanation: The line `max_profit = current_profit` updates the value of `max_profit` to be equal to the current value of `current_profit`. Since `current_profit` was already greater than `max_profit` before this line, the new value of `max_profit` is now equal to `current_profit`. All other variables remain unchanged.
