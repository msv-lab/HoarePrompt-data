Output State: **`k` is 0, `heap` contains the new item after pushing and popping, `max_profit` is now equal to `current_profit - item[1]` if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0` or `current_profit + item[0]` if `item[0] + item[1] < 0`, `combined` does not contain the last popped item (`item`), `removed_item` is the last element popped from `combined`, `current_profit` is adjusted by either reducing it by `item[1]` or increasing it by `item[0]`, and `max_profit` is set to `current_profit` if `current_profit > max_profit`.**

Explanation: The code `removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)` performs two operations: it pushes the `item` onto the heap and immediately pops the smallest item from the heap, assigning it to `removed_item`. This operation updates the `heap` to maintain its heap property. The `max_profit` and `current_profit` are updated based on the condition `item[0] + item[1] >= 0` or `item[0] + item[1] < 0`, and `combined` does not contain the `removed_item`.
