Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it calculates the maximum profit Alice can achieve by combining her prices (a_i) and Bob's prices (b_i) under certain conditions. Specifically, it uses a heap to manage a subset of these prices and iteratively adjusts the profit based on the combined values. After processing all test cases, it prints the highest profit achieved across all cases.**
