Postcondition: **`combined` is an empty list, `heap` contains all the tuples that were popped from `combined` during the iterations, `max_profit` is still 0, `current_profit` is still 0, `k` is 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`. The condition `(combined)` is false since `combined` is now empty.**
