Postcondition: **`combined` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order (excluding the last tuple which was popped), `heap` is a list containing one more tuple than before (the tuple that was popped from `combined`), `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, and the condition `combined` is false.**

This postcondition summarizes both cases of the if-else block. If the condition `combined` is true, `combined` remains unchanged (except for the last tuple being popped), `heap` gains one more tuple, and the condition becomes false. If the condition `combined` is false, it remains false, and all other variables retain their states as described in the else part.
