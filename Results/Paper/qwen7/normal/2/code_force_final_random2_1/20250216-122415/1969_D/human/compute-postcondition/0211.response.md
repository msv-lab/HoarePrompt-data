Output State: **`combined` has at least one element less than before; `item` is the last element of `combined` before popping.**

Explanation: The `pop()` method removes and returns the last element from the list `combined`. After executing `item = combined.pop()`, the length of `combined` is reduced by one, and the value of `item` is the element that was removed. The initial condition that `combined` must have at least two elements is now true for `combined` having at least one element, and `item` holds the popped element.
