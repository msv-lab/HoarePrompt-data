Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `combined` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order, `max_profit` is 0, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `t` is the length of `test_cases`, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `current_profit` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(k):
    if combined:
        heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `k` is a positive integer, and after the execution of the if-else block, if `combined` had one less element, then `heap` has one more element which is the popped element from `combined`. If `combined` does not have one less element, then no changes are made to `heap`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `k` is a positive integer, and the `heap` contains one additional element which is the popped element from `combined`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `k` is a positive integer - 1, and the `heap` contains either the popped element from `combined` and the new element added by heappush, or it remains unchanged if the condition `combined` is false.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
