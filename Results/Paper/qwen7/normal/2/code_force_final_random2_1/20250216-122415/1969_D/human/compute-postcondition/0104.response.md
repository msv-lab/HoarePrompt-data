Output State: **`k` is greater than 0; `heap` now contains the value of `combined.pop()` if `combined` was not empty, otherwise `heap` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code pushes the popped value from `combined` into the `heap` using `heapq.heappush`. If `combined` is not empty, `combined.pop()` removes and returns the last item from `combined`, which is then added to `heap`. If `combined` is empty, `heap` remains unchanged. The value of `k` is unaffected by this operation.
