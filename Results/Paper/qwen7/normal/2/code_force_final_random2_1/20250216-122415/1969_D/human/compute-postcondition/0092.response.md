Output State: **`current_profit` is 0, `max_profit` is 0, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `t` remains unchanged, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `k` is the second return value of `func_2()`, `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`**.

The code sorts the `combined` list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple using a lambda function as the key for sorting. This means that the `combined` list will now be ordered by the values in the second position of each tuple. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
