Output State: **`combined` is an empty list, `max_profit` holds the highest value of `current_profit` encountered during the loop's execution, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `t` remains unchanged, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, and `current_profit` is 0.**

The code `remaining_items = []` assigns an empty list to the variable `remaining_items`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
