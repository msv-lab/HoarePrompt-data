Output State: **`k` is 0, `heap` contains the new item after pushing and popping, `max_profit` is now equal to either `current_profit - item[1]` if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0` or `current_profit + item[0]` if `item[0] + item[1] < 0`, `combined` is now one item smaller, and `item` is the last element popped from `combined`.**

Explanation:
- `removed_item` is assigned the value of `heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)`, which means `item` is pushed into the heap and the smallest element (top of the heap) is popped out and stored in `removed_item`.
- `k` remains unchanged at 0.
- The `heap` now contains the new item after the push and pop operation.
- `max_profit` remains unchanged as it is not directly affected by this line of code.
- `combined` is one item smaller because `item` was popped from it.
- `item` is the last element that was popped from `combined`.
