Output State: **`k` is 0, `heap` contains the new item after pushing and popping, `max_profit` is now equal to `current_profit - item[1]` if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0` or `current_profit + item[0]` if `item[0] + item[1] < 0`, `combined` does not contain the last popped item (`item`), `removed_item` is the last element popped from `combined`, `current_profit` is adjusted by either subtracting `removed_item[0]` or by subtracting `item[1]` or increasing it by `item[0]`, and `max_profit` is set to `current_profit` if `current_profit > max_profit`; `max_profit` is reassigned to `current_profit`.**

This means that after executing the line `max_profit = current_profit`, the `max_profit` variable is simply reassigned to the current value of `current_profit`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
