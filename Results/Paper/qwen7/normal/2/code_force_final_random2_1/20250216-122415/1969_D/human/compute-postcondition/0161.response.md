Output State: **All items have been processed from the `combined` list, `heap` is empty, `max_profit` is the highest profit achieved during any iteration of the loop, `current_profit` is the final profit after processing all items, `k` remains 0, and the values of `test_cases`, `t`, `remaining_items`, `neg_prices`, `n`, and `bonuses` remain unchanged.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop have completed:
- The `combined` list will be empty since all items have been processed.
- The `heap` will be empty as items are pushed and popped during each iteration.
- `max_profit` will hold the highest profit achieved throughout the entire process.
- `current_profit` will reflect the final profit after considering all items in `combined`.
- `k` remains unchanged at 0.
- The values of `test_cases`, `t`, `remaining_items`, `neg_prices`, `n`, and `bonuses` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop.
