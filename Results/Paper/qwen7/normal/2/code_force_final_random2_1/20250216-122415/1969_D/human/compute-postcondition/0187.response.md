Output State: **`combined` is an empty list, `heap` contains all the tuples that were popped from `combined` during the iterations, `max_profit` is still 0, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`, `k` is 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `current_profit` by calling the function `func_3(combined, heap)`. Since `combined` is an empty list, the exact value of `current_profit` depends on the implementation of `func_3`. However, we know that `combined` is now empty, and all other variables remain unchanged.
