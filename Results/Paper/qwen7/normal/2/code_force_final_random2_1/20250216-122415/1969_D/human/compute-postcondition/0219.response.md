Output State: **`combined` has at least one element less than before; `heap` now contains the new last element of `combined` which replaced `item`; `current_profit` is reduced by either the first element or the second element of the last element of `combined` before popping, depending on whether the sum of the first and second elements is greater than or equal to 0; `item` is the last element of `combined` before popping; `removed_item` is the last element of `combined` before popping, and `max_profit` is set to `current_profit`.**

In this step, the code sets `max_profit` to the value of `current_profit`. No other variables are affected. The conditions and values of `combined`, `heap`, `current_profit`, `item`, and `removed_item` remain as described in the initial state.
