Output State: **`combined` has at least one element less than before; `current_profit` is increased by the value of the last element of `combined` before popping; `item` is the last element of `combined` before popping.**

This means that the `current_profit` has been updated by adding the value of the last element (`item[0]`) from the `combined` list before it was popped. The `combined` list now has at least one element less than before, and `item` still holds the value of the last element that was removed.
