Output State: **`combined` will be an empty list, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`, `test_cases` will remain unchanged, `t` will remain unchanged, `heap` will contain all elements that were popped from `combined` during the iterations, `remaining_items` will be an empty list, and `current_profit` will be 0.**

Explanation: The line `max_profit = current_profit` simply assigns the value of `current_profit` to `max_profit`. Since `combined` is an empty list, `current_profit` is returned as 0 by the function `func_3(combined, heap)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
