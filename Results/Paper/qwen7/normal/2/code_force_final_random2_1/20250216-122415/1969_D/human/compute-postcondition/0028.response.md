Output State: **`combined` is not empty, `max_profit` remains 0, `test_cases` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `heap` contains all elements that were popped from `combined` during the iterations, `remaining_items` is an empty list, and `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`**.

This means that the `current_profit` variable now holds the value returned by the function `func_3(combined, heap)`. All other variables retain their initial states.
