Output State: **`heap` is an empty list, `max_profit` is the highest profit achieved during any iteration of the loop, `current_profit` is the final profit after processing all items, `k` is 0, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` is the value returned by `func_2()`, and `k` is the second value returned by `func_2()`**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = func_2()` calls the function `func_2()` which returns two values. These values are assigned to `n` and `k` respectively. All other variables (`heap`, `max_profit`, `current_profit`, `remaining_items`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
