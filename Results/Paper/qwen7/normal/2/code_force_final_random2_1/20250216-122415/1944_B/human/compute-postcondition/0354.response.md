Output State: **`k` is equal to -1, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `len(l)` must be at least `n`, `ans2` contains the element `l[n + 1]`, `ans1` contains the element `l[n + 1]`, and we break out of the loop.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is executed, which immediately terminates the loop. Therefore, the values of `k`, `i`, `len(l)`, `ans2`, and `ans1` remain unchanged from their previous states, and the loop is broken.
