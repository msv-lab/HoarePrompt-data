Output State: **`k` is an integer, `ans1` contains the elements `[b[i + 1], b[i + 1]]` if `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, otherwise `k` remains unchanged, `l` contains the element `b[i + 1]` appended to it if `b[i + 1]` is not equal to `b[i + 2]`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `b[i]` is appended to `l`.**

This means that the value of `l` has been updated by appending `b[i]` to it, while the other conditions and variables remain unchanged from their initial postconditions.
