Output State: **`b` is a sublist of `a` containing the first `n` elements and sorted, `c` is a sublist of `a` containing the last `len(a) - n` elements and now sorted, `i` is equal to the length of list `l`, `k` is -4 * (number of consecutive pairs found), `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `q` is `len(l) + 1`, `t` remains the same, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `req` is equal to `k`, `l` is a list with two elements `[b[0], b[n - 1]]`, `b[0]` is the first element of the sorted sublist `b`.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the last element of the sublist `b` to the list `l`. Initially, `l` contains only the first element of the sorted sublist `b`. After appending `b[n - 1]` to `l`, `l` now contains two elements: the first element of `b` and the last element of `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
