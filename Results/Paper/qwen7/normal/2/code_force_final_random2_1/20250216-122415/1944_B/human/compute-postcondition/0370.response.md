Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a test case defined by three components: a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), an array a of length 2n where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, and two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 5 × 10^4, 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋). For each test case, it returns information based on the given inputs.**
