`k` is decremented by 1, changing its value from -1 to -2. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is defined as `n + 1` and is not directly modified. The length of `l` and the contents of `ans1` and `ans2` remain unchanged because they are not directly affected by the operation `k -= 1`. The loop condition to break out of the iteration if `k` equals 0 also remains valid.

Output State: **`k` is -2, `i` is `n + 1`, `len(l)` must be at least `n`, `ans2` now contains the elements `l[n + 1]` and the element appended from `l[i]`, `ans1` appends the element `l[n + 1]` to itself, and the loop breaks out of the iteration if `k` equals 0.**
