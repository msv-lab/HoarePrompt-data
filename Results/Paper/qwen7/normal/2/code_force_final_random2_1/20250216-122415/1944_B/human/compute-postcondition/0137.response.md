Output State: **`k` is `-4 * (len(l) - 1)`, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is a list that includes all elements from `l` except the last one, `q` is `t`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `b` is a sublist of `a` containing the first `n` elements sorted in ascending order, `c` is a sublist of `a` containing the elements from index `n` to the end, and `c` is sorted in ascending order, `req` is equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The variable `req` is assigned the value of `k`, which is `-4 * (len(l) - 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
