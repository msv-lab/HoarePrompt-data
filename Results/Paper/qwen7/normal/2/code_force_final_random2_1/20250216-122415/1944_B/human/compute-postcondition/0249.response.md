Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of list `l`, `k` is -2 * (number of consecutive pairs found), `ans1` contains all elements of list `l`, `ans2` contains all pairs of consecutive identical elements found in list `l`, `q` is `len(l) + 1`, `t` remains the same, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the input using `input().split(' ')` and converts each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The resulting list of integers is assigned to the variable `a`. The values of `i`, `k`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `q`, `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
