Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of list `l`, `k` is -2 * (number of consecutive pairs found), `ans1` contains all elements of list `l`, `ans2` contains all pairs of consecutive identical elements found in list `l`, `q` is `len(l) + 1`, `t` remains the same, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The values of `i`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `q`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `n` and `k` as input integers, while the other variables retain their initial values.
