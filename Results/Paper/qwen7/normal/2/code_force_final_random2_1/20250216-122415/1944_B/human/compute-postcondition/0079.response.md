Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `k` is equal to 0, `c[i]` is equal to `c[0]`, `ans2` contains the value `[c[0]]`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `c[i]` (which is `c[0]`) to the list `ans2`. Since `i` is 1, `c[i]` is `c[1]`, but initially, it was stated that `c[i]` is equal to `c[0]`. Therefore, `ans2` now contains the value `[c[0]]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
