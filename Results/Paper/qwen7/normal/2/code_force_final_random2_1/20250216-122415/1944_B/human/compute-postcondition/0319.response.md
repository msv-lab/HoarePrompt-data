Output State: **`k` is equal to `req`, `i` is 2, `n` is defined and greater than 1, `ans2` contains the value of `c[1]`, and the value of `c[i]` is equal to the value of `c[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so when the code runs, `i` becomes 2 (since the index in the list starts from 0). Therefore, `ans2` now contains the value of `c[1]`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
