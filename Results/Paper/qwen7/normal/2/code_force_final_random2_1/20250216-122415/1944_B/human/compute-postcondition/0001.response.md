Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `q` is used in the loop head.

2. **Determine the Initial State of the Variables:**
   - `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
   - `q` is the loop variable and will take values from 0 to \(t-1\) during the loop iterations.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `q < t`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `t` is already defined and within the specified range, no adjustment is needed for `t`.
   - For the loop to execute, `q` must be less than `t`. Initially, `q` is 0 (since the loop starts with `q = 0`).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `q` being less than `t`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `q` is 0 and must be less than `t`**
