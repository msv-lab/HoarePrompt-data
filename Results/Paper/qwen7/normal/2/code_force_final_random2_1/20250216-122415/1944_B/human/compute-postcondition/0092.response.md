Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be at least 2
   - `k` is -4
   - `ans2` contains the elements `[c[2], c[2]]`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`.

3. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.

4. **Loop Body Analysis:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but based on the postcondition, if `c[2]` is equal to `c[1]`, then `k` is set to -4, and `ans2` contains `[c[2], c[2]]`.
   - Otherwise, the values of `i`, `n`, `k`, and `ans2` remain unchanged.

5. **Determining the Next State:**
   - Since the loop condition is `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`, and `i` is currently 2, the loop will run again as long as `n` is at least 3 (since `i` will increment to 3 in the next iteration).
   - The values of `i` and `n` will change in the next iteration. Specifically, `i` will become 3, and `n` must still be at least 3 for the loop to continue.

6. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the updated states at the start of the next iteration of the loop are:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be at least 3, `k` is -4, and `ans2` contains the elements `[c[2], c[2]]`**.
