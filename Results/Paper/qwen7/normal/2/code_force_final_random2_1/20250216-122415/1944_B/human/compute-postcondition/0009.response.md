Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `q` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `c` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order starting from index `n` of list `a`, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `ans2 = []` initializes an empty list named `ans2`. This does not affect the values of any other variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `q`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `ans1` remain unchanged.
