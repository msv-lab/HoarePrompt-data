Output State: **`k` is `-2 * (len(l) - 1)`, `ans1` is a list that includes all elements from `l`, `ans2` is a list that includes all elements from `l` except the last one, `q` is `t`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `b` is a sublist of `a` containing the first `n` elements.**

Explanation: The code `b = a[:n]` creates a new list `b` that contains the first `n` elements from the list `a`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
