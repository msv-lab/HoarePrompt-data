Postcondition: `k` is an integer. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `k` is an integer - 2, and `ans1` contains the elements `[b[i], b[i]]`. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `k` remains unchanged, and if `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, `l` contains the element `b[i]` appended to it.
