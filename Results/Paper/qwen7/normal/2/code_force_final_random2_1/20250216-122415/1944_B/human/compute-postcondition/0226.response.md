Output State: **`i` is 1, `ans1` contains the element at index 0 of list `l`, and if `k` equals 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The line `ans1.append(l[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `l` to the list `ans1`. Initially, `i` is 0, so `ans1` will now contain the first element of `l`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 after appending the element. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
