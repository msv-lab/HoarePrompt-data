Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is -1, `ans1` contains the element at index 0 of list `l` appended with the element at index 2 of list `l`, `ans2` contains the element at index 1 of list `l` appended with the element at index 2 of list `l`, and `ans1` has the element at index 3 of list `l` appended to it, and `ans2` has the element at index `i` of list `l` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the element at index `i` (which is 3) of list `l` to `ans2`. So, `ans2` now contains the element at index 1 of list `l` appended with the element at index 2 of list `l`, and then the element at index 3 of list `l`. All other variables remain unchanged.
