Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `q` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is either twice the original value of `k` or twice the original value of `k` minus 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, the first element of `b` is not equal to the second element of `b`, `c` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order starting from index `n` of list `a`, `ans1` is either an empty list or a list containing the last element of list `b` appended with the element at index `n-1` of list `b`, `ans2` is either an empty list or a list containing the last element of list `b`, `req` is equal to the original value of `k`, `l` is a list containing the first element of `b` and either the last element of `b` or the element at index `n-1` of `b`.**
