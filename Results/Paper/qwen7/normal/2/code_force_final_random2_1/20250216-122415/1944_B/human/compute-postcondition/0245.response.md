Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to the length of list `l`.
- `k` is -2 times the number of consecutive pairs found.
- `ans1` contains all elements of list `l`.
- `ans2` contains all pairs of consecutive identical elements found in list `l`.

The `print(*ans1)` statement will print all elements of the list `l` separated by spaces.

Output: **what is printed in the list l**
