Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `k` is equal to `req`, `ans1` is unchanged, `ans2` remains the same as all elements from `l` except the last one, `q` is `t`, `n` is the input integer, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `c` is an empty list, and `l` is modified according to the conditions inside the loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
        ans2.append(c[i])
        ans2.append(c[i])
        k -= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is at least 1, `n` is a positive integer, and the current value of `k` is either -2 or 0. If `c[i]` equals `c[i - 1]`, then `k` is -2 and `ans2` contains the value of `c[i]` and appends `c[i]` to itself. If `c[i]` does not equal `c[i - 1]`, then `k` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is at least 2, `n` is a positive integer, and the current value of `k` is either -2 or 0. If `c[i]` equals `c[i - 1]` and `k` is -2, then `ans2` contains the element `c[i]` appended to it. If `c[i]` does not equal `c[i - 1]`, the value of `k` remains unchanged and `ans2` also remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `k` is an integer. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `k` is decremented by 2, `ans2` is a list that now includes `c[i]`, and if `k` was equal to 0 before the execution, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i - 1]`, then nothing changes.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
