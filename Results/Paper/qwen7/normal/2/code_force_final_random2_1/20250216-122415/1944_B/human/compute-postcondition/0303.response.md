Output State: **`i` is 3, the length of list `l` is either 1, 2, or 3, and `k` equals 0; `ans1` is a list with the elements `b[3]` and `b[3]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. Given that `i` is 3, `b[i]` is `b[3]`. Since `ans1` initially contains the element `b[3]`, after appending `b[3]` again, `ans1` now contains `b[3]` twice. All other variables remain unchanged.
