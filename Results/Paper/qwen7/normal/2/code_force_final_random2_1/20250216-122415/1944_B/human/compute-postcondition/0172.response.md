Output State: **`k` is an integer, if `b[i + 1]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `k` is `k - 2`, and `ans1` contains the elements `[b[i + 1], b[i + 1]]`, otherwise `k` remains unchanged; `l` contains the element `b[i]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `b[i]` to the list `l`. The value of `k` and the condition for `ans1` remain unchanged unless `b[i + 1]` equals `b[i]`, in which case `k` would be updated to `k - 2` and `ans1` would contain `[b[i + 1], b[i + 1]]`. Since the code only appends `b[i]` to `l`, the output state reflects this change while keeping the conditions for `k` and `ans1` intact.
