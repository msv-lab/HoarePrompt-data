Output State: **`i` is at least 2, `n` is a positive integer, and the current value of `k` is either -2 or 0. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `n`, and `k`. It only indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no new assignments or operations are performed, the values of `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
