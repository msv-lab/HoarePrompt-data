You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

    2 1
    6 4
    1 3
    1 2
    1 2
    5 1 3 3
    6 4 2 4
    
Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by a positive integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 5000), an array \( a \) of length 2\( n \) where each integer from 1 to \( n \) appears exactly twice, and two integers \( n \) and \( k \) (2 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 5 × 10^4, 1 ≤ \( k \) ≤ ⌊\( n \)/2⌋). For each test case, it splits the array \( a \) into two halves, sorts them, and then constructs two lists, \( ans1 \) and \( ans2 \), by selecting specific elements from the sorted halves and the original array. Finally, it prints these two lists. The function ensures that \( ans1 \) and \( ans2 \) contain all necessary elements from the original array and the sorted halves, adhering to the constraints on \( k \).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then the array `a`.

2. **Splitting the Array:**
   - The array `a` is split into two halves: `b` (first half) and `c` (second half).

3. **Sorting the Halves:**
   - Both `b` and `c` are sorted. This step is unnecessary for solving the problem since the requirement is to find subsets with equal XOR values, not to ensure the elements are in any particular order.

4. **Constructing Subsets `l` and `r`:**
   - The program tries to construct `l` and `r` such that their XOR values are equal.
   - It starts by checking the first and last elements of `b` and `c`. If they are different, it adds them to `l`.
   - It then iterates through the middle elements of `b` and `c`, adding pairs of identical elements to `l` and `r` to balance the XOR values.
   - Finally, it fills the remaining positions in `l` and `r` using elements from `b` and `c` that have not been used yet.

### Issues Identified

1. **Unnecessary Sorting:**
   - Sorting `b` and `c` is unnecessary because the problem does not require the elements to be in any specific order. The sorting step is redundant and can be removed.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Constructing Subsets:**
   - The logic for constructing `l` and `r` is flawed. Specifically, the program assumes that adding pairs of identical elements will always result in equal XOR values, which is not necessarily true. The program needs to ensure that the XOR values of `l` and `r` are equal, not just add pairs of identical elements.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, if `b` and `c` do not have enough elements to form the required subsets, the program might fail to produce valid outputs.

### Corrected Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we should use a more systematic approach to ensure that the XOR values of `l` and `r` are equal. One possible method is to use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each element in both halves of the array and then construct the subsets accordingly.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the provided program is not correct. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
