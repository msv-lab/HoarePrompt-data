Output State: **`i` is 2, the length of list `l` is either 2 or 3, and `k` equals 0.**

Explanation: The code `l.append(b[i])` appends the value of `b[i]` to the list `l`. Given that `i` is 2, `b[i]` refers to `b[2]`. Since the initial length of list `l` is either 1 or 2, after appending `b[2]`, the length of `l` will be either 2 (if it was initially 1) or 3 (if it was initially 2). The value of `k` remains unchanged and is still 0.
