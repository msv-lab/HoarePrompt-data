Postcondition: `i` is at least 2, `n` is a positive integer, and the current value of `k` is either -2 or 0. If `c[i]` equals `c[i - 1]` and `k` is -2, then `ans2` contains the element `c[i]` appended to it. If `c[i]` does not equal `c[i - 1]`, the value of `k` remains unchanged and `ans2` also remains unchanged.
