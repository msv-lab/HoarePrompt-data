Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `b` is a sublist of `a` containing the first `n` elements and sorted, `c` is a sublist of `a` containing the last `len(a) - n` elements and now sorted, `i` is equal to the length of list `l`, `k` is -4 * (number of consecutive pairs found) - 2, `ans1` is a list containing the elements `b[n - 1]` and `b[n - 1]`, `ans2` is an empty list, `q` is `len(l) + 1`, `t` remains the same, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `req` is equal to `k`, `l` is a list with either one element `[b[0]]` or two elements `[b[0], b[n - 1]]`, `b[0]` is the first element of the sorted sublist `b`. If `b[0]` is not equal to `b[1]`, then `b` has its first element added to list `l`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
        ans1.append(b[i])
        ans1.append(b[i])
        k -= 2
    elif b[i] != b[i + 1]:
        l.append(b[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, the length of list `l` is either 1 or 2, and `k` equals 0. If `b[1]` is equal to `b[0]`, then `l` contains the value of `b[1]`. If `b[1]` is not equal to `b[2]`, then `l` contains the elements `b[1]` and `b[2]`. If `b[1]` is equal to `b[2]`, then `l` still contains the element `b[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, the length of list `l` is either 1, 2, or 3, and `k` equals 0. If `b[2]` is equal to `b[1]`, then `ans1` is a list with the elements `b[2]` and `b[2]`, and `k` is -2. If `b[2]` is not equal to `b[3]`, then the condition is met as stated.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, the length of list `l` is either 1, 2, or 3, and `k` equals 0. If `b[3]` is equal to `b[2]`, then `k` is set to -2 and `ans1` is a list with the elements `b[3]` and `b[3]`. Otherwise, if `b[3]` is not equal to `b[4]`, the length of list `l` becomes 2. Otherwise, the length of list `l` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
