Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1`, so `i` starts from `1` and goes up to `n-2`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `k` is an integer.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `k` is reduced by 2, and `b[i]` is appended to `ans1`.
   - If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `b[i]` is added to `l` if it is not equal to `b[i + 1]`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `k` remains unchanged unless `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, but since we are looking at the state before the increment, `k` is still as it was before the increment.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`k` is an integer, `i` is incremented by 1 (so `i` is now `i + 1`), `n` remains the same.**
