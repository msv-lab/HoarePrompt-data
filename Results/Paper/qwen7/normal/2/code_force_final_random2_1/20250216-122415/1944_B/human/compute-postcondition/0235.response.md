Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is -1, `ans1` contains the element at index 0 of list `l` appended with the element at index 2 of list `l`, `ans2` contains the element at index 1 of list `l` appended with the element at index 2 of list `l`.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is decremented by 1, so `k` is now -1. The other variables (`i`, `ans1`, and `ans2`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
