Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 500, `q` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `c` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order starting from index `n` of list `a`, `ans1` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `ans1`. None of the other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain as they were in the initial state.
