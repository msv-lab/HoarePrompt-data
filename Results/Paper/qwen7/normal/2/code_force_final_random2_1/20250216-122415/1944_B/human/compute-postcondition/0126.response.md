Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `k` is defined as `-2 * (len(l) - 1)`.
   - `ans1` is a list that includes all elements from `l`.
   - `ans2` is a list that includes all elements from `l` except the last one.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - `print(*ans2)`

From the initial state, we know that `ans2` is a list that contains all elements from `l` except the last one. When we print `*ans2`, it will print all elements of `ans2` separated by spaces.

Since the exact contents of `l` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact printed output. However, we can describe the output in terms of the elements of `l`.

Output: **all elements of ans2 (which are all elements of l except the last one) separated by spaces**
