Postcondition: **`k` is an integer, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now `i + 1`, and `n` remains the same. If `k` is not 0, the conditions and changes described in the if part apply. If `k` is 0, no changes are made to `k`, `b[i]` is not added to `ans1`, and `b[i]` does not equal `b[i - 1]`. Additionally, `b[i]` is not added to `l` if `b[i]` equals `b[i + 1]`.**
