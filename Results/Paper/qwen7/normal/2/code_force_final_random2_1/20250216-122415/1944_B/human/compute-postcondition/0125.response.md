Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `k` is defined as `-2 * (len(l) - 1)`. This means `k` is a value that depends on the length of the list `l`.
   - `ans1` is a list that includes all elements from `l`. So, `ans1` is simply a copy of the list `l`.
   - `ans2` is a list that includes all elements from `l` except the last one. This means `ans2` is `l` with the last element removed.

2. **Print Statement Analysis**:
   - The `print(*ans1)` statement will print the elements of the list `ans1` separated by spaces. Since `ans1` is a copy of `l`, it will print all elements of `l`.

Given this analysis, the output will be all elements of the list `l` printed on a single line, separated by spaces.

Output: **all elements of list l separated by spaces**
