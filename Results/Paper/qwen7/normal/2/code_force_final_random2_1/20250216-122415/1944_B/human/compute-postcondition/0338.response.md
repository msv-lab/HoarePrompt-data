Output State: **`k` is equal to `req` - 4, `i` is 5, `n` is greater than 1, `ans2` contains the values of `c[1]`, `c[2]`, `c[3]`, `c[4]`, and `c[5]`, and `c[5]` is equal to the value of `c[4]` with `c[i]` appended to `ans2`.**

Explanation: The code appends `c[i]` (which is `c[5]` since `i` is 5) to the list `ans2`. The initial values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `ans2` now includes all the values of `c[1]`, `c[2]`, `c[3]`, `c[4]`, and `c[5]`.
