Output State: **`k` is an integer, if `b[i + 1]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `k` is `k - 2`, and `ans1` contains the elements `[b[i + 1], b[i + 1]]`, otherwise `k` remains unchanged; `ans1` now contains the element `b[i]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the element `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. The value of `k` and the condition related to `b[i + 1]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new element in `ans1`.
