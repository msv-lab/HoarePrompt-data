Output State: **`k` is an integer, if `b[i + 1]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `k` is `k - 2`, and `ans1` contains the elements `[b[i + 1], b[i + 1]]`, if `b[i + 1]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then `k` remains unchanged, and if `b[i + 1]` is not equal to `b[i + 2]`, `l` contains the element `b[i + 1]` appended to it, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where the conditions for updating `k`, `ans1`, and `l` are checked. Since the `break` statement does not modify any variables, the values of `k`, `ans1`, and `l` remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
