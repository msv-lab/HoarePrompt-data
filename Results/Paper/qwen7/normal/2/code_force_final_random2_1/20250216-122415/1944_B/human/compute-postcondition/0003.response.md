Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `q` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list called `a`. The values of `t`, `q`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
