Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head includes the variable `i` and the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` starts from 1 (as per the range function `range(1, n)`).
   - `n` is an unknown value but must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

3. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < n`.
   - For each iteration, `i` increments by 1.

4. **Adjust the states based on the loop head**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1, we need to ensure `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute at least once (since `i` starts at 1 and goes up to `n-1`).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2**
