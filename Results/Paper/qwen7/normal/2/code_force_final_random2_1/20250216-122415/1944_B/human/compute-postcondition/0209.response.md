Output State: **`i` is at least 2, `n` is a positive integer, and the current value of `k` is -2; `ans2` now contains the element `c[i]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decremented by 2, changing its value from either -2 or 0 to -2. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `ans2`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
