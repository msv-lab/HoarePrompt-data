Output State: **`k` is an integer, `ans1` contains the element `b[i]` appended to it, `l` contains the element `b[i + 1]` appended to it if `b[i + 1]` is not equal to `b[i + 2]`, `i` is incremented by 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**

Explanation: The code `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the element `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. The other variables (`k`, `l`, and the condition for appending to `l`) remain unchanged from their previous states. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
