Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Postcondition: `k` is `-4 * (len(l) - 1)`, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is a list that includes all elements from `l` except the last one, `q` is `t`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `c` is an empty list, `req` is equal to `k`, and `l` now has its last element appended with the first element of `b`, unless `b[0]` is equal to `b[1]`, in which case no changes are made to `l`. If `b[n - 2]` is not equal to `b[n - 1]`, then `k` remains unchanged, `ans1` remains empty, `ans2` remains the same as all elements from `l` except the last one, and `l` is modified as described. If `b[n - 2]` is equal to `b[n - 1]`, then `k` becomes `-4 * (len(l) - 1) - 2`, `ans1` becomes a list containing the elements `b[n - 1]` and `b[n - 1]`, and `l` is modified as described.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
        ans1.append(b[i])
        ans1.append(b[i])
        k -= 2
    elif b[i] != b[i + 1]:
        l.append(b[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `k` is an integer. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `k` is an integer - 2, and `ans1` contains the elements `[b[i], b[i]]`. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `k` remains unchanged, and if `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, `l` contains the element `b[i]` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `k` is an integer, `ans1` contains the elements `[b[i + 1], b[i + 1]]` if `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, otherwise `k` remains unchanged and if `b[i + 1]` is not equal to `b[i + 2]`, `l` contains the element `b[i + 1]` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `k` is an integer, `ans1` contains the elements `[b[i + 1], b[i + 1]]` if `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, otherwise `k` remains unchanged and `ans1` contains the element `b[i]` appended to it. `l` contains the element `b[i + 1]` appended to it if `b[i + 1]` is not equal to `b[i + 2]` or `b[i]` is appended to `l`. `i` is incremented by 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
