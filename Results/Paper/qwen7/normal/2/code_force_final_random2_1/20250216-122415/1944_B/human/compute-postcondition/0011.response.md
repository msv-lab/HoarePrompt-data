Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `q` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is twice the original value of `k`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces, `b` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `c` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order starting from index `n` of list `a`, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is equal to the original value of `k`.**

The code simply assigns the original value of `k` to the variable `req`, which does not change any of the other variables or their states. Therefore, all the other variables remain unchanged, and `req` is set to the original value of `k`.
