Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `k = req - 2 * (n - 1)`
     - Here, `k` is calculated based on the values of `req` and `n`.
   - `i = n + len(l) - 1`
     - `i` is the sum of `n` and the length of the list `l` minus 1.
   - `len(l) >= n`
     - The length of the list `l` is at least `n`.
   - `ans2` contains the elements from `l[n]` to `l[len(l) - 1]` if they are equal to their preceding elements.
     - This means `ans2` is a list of elements from `l[n]` to `l[len(l) - 1]` where each element is equal to the previous element in the list.
   - `ans1` contains the same elements as `ans2` since `ans1` and `ans2` append the same elements from `l`.
     - Therefore, `ans1` also contains the same elements as `ans2`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - `print(*ans2)`
     - The `*` operator is used to unpack the elements of `ans2` and print them separated by spaces.

Given these details, let's determine what will be printed:

- Since `ans2` contains elements from `l[n]` to `l[len(l) - 1]` where each element is equal to the previous element, `ans2` will contain repeated elements.
- The exact elements in `ans2` depend on the specific values in `l[n]` to `l[len(l) - 1]`.

Therefore, the output will be the elements of `ans2` printed as a space-separated sequence.

Output: **[repeated elements from l[n] to l[len(l) - 1]]**
