Output State: **`k` is an integer, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` remains the same, `ans1` contains `b[i]` appended.**

Explanation: The code `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the value of `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. Since `b[i]` is unchanged, the only change is that `ans1` now includes the value of `b[i]` in addition to its previous contents. The other variables (`k`, `i`, `n`) remain unchanged.
