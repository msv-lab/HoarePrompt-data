Output State: **`k` is an integer - 2, `ans1` contains the element `b[i]` appended to it, `l` contains the element `b[i + 1]` appended to it if `b[i + 1]` is not equal to `b[i + 2]`, `i` is incremented by 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decremented by 2. All other variables (`ans1`, `l`, `i`) remain unchanged from their previous states. The condition for appending elements to `l` and the increment of `i` remain the same.
