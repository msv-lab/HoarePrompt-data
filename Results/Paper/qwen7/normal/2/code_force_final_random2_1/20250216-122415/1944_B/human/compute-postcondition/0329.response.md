Output State: **`k` is equal to `req` - 2, `i` is 3, `n` is defined and greater than 1, `ans2` contains the values of `c[1]` and `c[2]` and now also includes `c[3]`, and the value of `c[i]` is equal to the value of `c[i - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the value of `c[i]` to the list `ans2`. Given that `i` is 3, `c[i]` is `c[3]`, which is equal to `c[2]` (since `c[i]` is equal to the value of `c[i - 1]`). Therefore, `ans2` now includes `c[1]`, `c[2]`, and `c[3]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
