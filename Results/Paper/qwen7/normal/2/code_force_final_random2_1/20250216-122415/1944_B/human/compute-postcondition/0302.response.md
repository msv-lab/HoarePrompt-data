Output State: **`i` is 3, the length of list `l` is either 1, 2, or 3, and `k` equals 0; `ans1` is a list with the element `b[3]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. Given that `i` is 3, `ans1` will now contain the element `b[3]`. The values of `i`, the length of list `l`, and `k` remain unchanged from the initial state.
