Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is -2, `ans1` contains the element at index 0 of list `l` appended with the element at index 2 of list `l`, `ans2` contains the element at index 1 of list `l` appended with the element at index 2 of list `l`, and `ans1` has the element at index 3 of list `l` appended to it, and `ans2` has the element at index 3 of list `l` appended to it.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is decremented by 1, changing its value from `-1` to `-2`. The other variables (`i`, `ans1`, `ans2`) remain unchanged as the code snippet only affects `k`.
