Output State: **`k` is an integer, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` remains the same, `l` includes the value of `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the value of `b[i]` to the list `l`. Since `k` is not specified to change (it could be 0 or non-zero), the condition checks do not affect the values of `k`, `b[i]` is added to `l`, and `i` is incremented by 1 as per the initial state description.
