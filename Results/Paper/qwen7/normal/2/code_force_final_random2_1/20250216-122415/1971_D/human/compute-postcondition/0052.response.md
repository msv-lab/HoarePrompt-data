Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s` is an input string, `count` is 2, `flag` is True, `j` is 1, and the current value of `s[j]` is '1' and the current value of `s[j + 1]` is '1'.**

Explanation: The variable `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` changes from 0 to 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The current value of `s[j]` (which is now `s[1]`) is '1', and the value of `s[j + 1]` (which is now `s[2]`) is also '1' since `s` is an input string and its current values at these indices are updated accordingly.
