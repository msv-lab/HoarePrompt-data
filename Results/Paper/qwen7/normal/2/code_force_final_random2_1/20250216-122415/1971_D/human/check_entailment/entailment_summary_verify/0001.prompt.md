You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
                    j += 1
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` and a binary string `s`. For each test case, it counts the number of transitions from '0' to '1' in the string `s`. If at least one such transition is found, it subtracts one from the count. The function prints the final count for each test case and does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which indicates the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `count` is initialized to 1. This variable will keep track of the number of pieces.
   - `flag` is a boolean variable used to check if there is at least one transition from '0' to '1'.
   - `j` is an index variable used to iterate through the string.

3. **Loop Through String:**
   - The loop iterates through the string `s` up to the second last character (`len(s) - 1`).
   - If the current character `s[j]` is different from the next character `s[j + 1]`, it means we have a transition point.
     - `count` is incremented because a new piece is needed at this transition.
     - If the transition is from '0' to '1', `flag` is set to `True`.
   - Regardless of the transition, `j` is incremented by 1 to move to the next character.

4. **Adjust Count Based on Flag:**
   - After the loop, if `flag` is `True`, it means there was at least one transition from '0' to '1'. In such a case, we subtract 1 from `count` because the last piece can be combined with the previous one.

5. **Output Result:**
   - The final value of `count` is printed, which represents the minimum number of pieces needed.

### Correctness Check

To verify the correctness, let's consider some examples:

- **Example 1:** `11010`
  - Transitions: `1 -> 0`, `0 -> 1`, `1 -> 0`
  - `count` increments twice, but since there is a transition from '0' to '1', we subtract 1 from `count`.
  - Final `count`: 2 (but since there is a transition from '0' to '1', it should be 3).

- **Example 2:** `00000000`
  - No transitions, so `count` remains 1.

- **Example 3:** `1`
  - No transitions, so `count` remains 1.

- **Example 4:** `10`
  - Transition: `1 -> 0`
  - `count` increments once, and since there is a transition from '1' to '0', no adjustment is needed.
  - Final `count`: 2.

- **Example 5:** `0001111`
  - No transitions, so `count` remains 1.

- **Example 6:** `0110`
  - Transitions: `0 -> 1`, `1 -> 1`, `1 -> 0`
  - `count` increments twice, but since there is a transition from '0' to '1', we subtract 1 from `count`.
  - Final `count`: 2 (but since there is a transition from '0' to '1', it should be 3).

From the above analysis, it appears that the logic does not correctly handle the case where the string starts with '1' and ends with '0'. The program fails to account for the initial piece when the string starts with '1'.

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the initial piece when the string starts with '1'. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Correctness: **False**
