Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive)**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 500`, the value of `t` remains within this range after executing the code. The other variables (`s`) are not affected and remain as described in the initial state.
