Postcondition: `i` is 2, `s` is a new input string with a length of at least 3, `count` is 3, `flag` is True, `t` must be greater than 1, `j` must be less than or equal to 2. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[j + 1]`, then `j` is increased by 1 if `s[j]` is '0' and `s[j + 1]` is '1'. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `s`, `count`, `flag`, and `j` remain unchanged.
