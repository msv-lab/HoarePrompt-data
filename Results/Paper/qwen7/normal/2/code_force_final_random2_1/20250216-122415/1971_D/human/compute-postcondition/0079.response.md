Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s` is an input string, `count` is a non-negative integer reflecting the total number of transitions from '0' to '1' found in the string `s` minus 1, `flag` is True, `j` is equal to `len(s) - 1`**.

The value of `count` is decremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s` is an input string, `flag` is True, and `j` is equal to `len(s) - 1` remains valid.
