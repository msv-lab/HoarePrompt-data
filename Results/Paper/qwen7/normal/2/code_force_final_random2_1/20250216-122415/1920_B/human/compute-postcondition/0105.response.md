Output State: **`i` is 0, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, `ans` is a list containing one element which is `sums`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `sums` is already defined as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, it is added to `ans`. The values of `i` and `sums` remain unchanged, and `ans` becomes a list with one element, which is the value of `sums`.
