Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1]`, `ans` contains the value of `sums` after the update.**

Explanation: The code updates `sums` by adding `a[i - 1]` to it. Given that `i` is 2, `a[i - 1]` is equivalent to `a[1]`. However, since the value of `a[1]` is not specified, we keep it as `a[1]` in the output state. The other variables (`i`, `x`, `n`, `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
