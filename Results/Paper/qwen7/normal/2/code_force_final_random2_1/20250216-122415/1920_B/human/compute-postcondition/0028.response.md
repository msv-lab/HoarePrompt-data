Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is a non-negative integer, `ans` is a list containing `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[i - 1]`, `sums` is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[i - 1]`**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Given the initial conditions, `sums` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, and then it is updated by adding `a[i - 1]` (which is `a[2 - 1]` or `a[1]`). Since `i` is now 3, the next iteration would use `i - 1` as 2, but the current state only reflects the last update. Therefore, `i` increments to 3, `ans` contains the updated `sums`, and `sums` itself is the updated value.
