Postcondition: `i` is `j + 1`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `ans` is a list with one additional element. If `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x]) + a[i - 1]`. In both cases, the new element added to the `ans` list is `sums`.
