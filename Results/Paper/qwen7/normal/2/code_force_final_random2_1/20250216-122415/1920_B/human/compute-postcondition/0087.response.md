Postcondition: `i` is 2 and `k` is a non-negative integer. If `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[1] - 2 * a[x]` and `ans` is a list containing one element which is `sums + a[1] - 2 * a[x]`. Otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[1]` and `ans` is a list containing `[sums + a[1]]`.
