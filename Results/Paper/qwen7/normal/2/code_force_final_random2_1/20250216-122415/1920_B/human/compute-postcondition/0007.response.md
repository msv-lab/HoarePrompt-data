Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `k`.
2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The variable `i` will take values from `0` to `k` inclusive. Therefore, `i` should start at `0`.
   - The variable `k` determines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute, `k` must be a non-negative integer.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` starts at `0`, we need to ensure that `i` is `0` at the start of the loop.
   - We need to ensure that `k` is a non-negative integer for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `k`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `k` must be a non-negative integer**
