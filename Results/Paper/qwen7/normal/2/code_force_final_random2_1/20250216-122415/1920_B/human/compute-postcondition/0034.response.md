Output State: **`i` is `j + 1`, `k` is a non-negative integer, `ans` is a list, `sums` is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sums` to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. The other variables (`i`, `j`, `k`, `ans`, `sum1`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
