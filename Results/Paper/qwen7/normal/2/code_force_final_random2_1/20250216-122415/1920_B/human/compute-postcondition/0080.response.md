Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - `k` is a non-negative integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `k` inclusive. This means the loop will run `k + 1` times.

4. **Analyze the loop body**:
   - The loop body is omitted, but we need to consider how the loop affects the variables `i` and `k`.

5. **Update the variables for the next iteration**:
   - Initially, `i` is 1.
   - Since the loop starts from 0 and goes up to `k`, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1` (which is 2).
   - `k` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - After the first iteration, `i` becomes 2.
   - `k` remains the same as it was initially.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `k` is a non-negative integer**.
