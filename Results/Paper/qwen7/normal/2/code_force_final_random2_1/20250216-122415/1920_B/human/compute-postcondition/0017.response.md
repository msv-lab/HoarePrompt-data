Output State: **`sums` is `sums + a[0]`, `i` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, and `ans` contains `[sums + a[0]]`.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `sums` was initially `sums + a[0]`, appending it to `ans` means `ans` now contains `[sums + a[0]]`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
