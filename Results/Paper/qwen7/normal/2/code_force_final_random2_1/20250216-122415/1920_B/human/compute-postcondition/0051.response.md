Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of sorted integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` is reversed.**

The code `a.reverse()` reverses the list `a`. Since the initial state of `a` was a list of sorted integers, after executing the code, `a` will be a list of these integers in reverse order. All other variables (`n`, `k`, and `x`) remain unchanged.
