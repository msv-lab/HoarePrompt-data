Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`**.

The code updates the variable `sums` to be the value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. However, the values of `sum1`, `a`, and `x` are not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `sums`. The other variables `i` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
