Postcondition: `i` is 2, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `sums` is updated based on the following conditions: if `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x - 1]`; otherwise, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[0]`. If `i` is 0, then `sums` is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. The variable `ans` contains the final value of `sums` after the update.
