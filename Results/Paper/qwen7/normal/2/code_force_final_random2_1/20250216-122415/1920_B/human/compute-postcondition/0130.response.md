Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `sums` is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, `ans` contains the final value of `sums` after the update, and `k` is greater than 2; `ans` is appended with the value of `sums`.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `sums` was previously updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, the value of `ans` now includes this updated value of `sums`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
