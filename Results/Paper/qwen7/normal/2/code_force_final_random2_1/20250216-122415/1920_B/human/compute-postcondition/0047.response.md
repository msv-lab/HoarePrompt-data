To solve this task, let's break down the problem step by step.

### Understanding the Loop Head
The loop head is defined as:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

From this, we can see that the loop variable `_` is simply an integer representing the number of iterations based on user input. There are no other variables directly controlled by the loop itself (like `i` or `x` from the example).

### Initial State
The initial state provided is:
- Output state after the loop executes all iterations is a list `ans` containing `k + 1` elements.
- Each element in `ans` represents the value of `sums` after each iteration of the loop.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **User Input**: The loop runs for a number of times specified by the user input.
2. **No Direct Variables Controlled by the Loop**: Since there are no variables like `i` or `x` that control the loop, the only thing that changes with each iteration is the user input itself.

### Adjusting the State
Since the loop does not control any specific variables, the state remains unchanged for each iteration. The only thing that changes is the number of iterations, which is determined by the user input.

### Final State
Given that the loop runs for a number of times specified by the user input, the final state after the loop executes all iterations will still be the same as the initial state because no variables within the loop are being modified.

### Conclusion
The state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time since there are no variables controlled by the loop itself.

**State:**
**`Output state after the loop executes all iterations is a list ans containing k + 1 elements. Each element in ans represents the value of sums after each iteration of the loop.`**

This means the state remains the same as it was before the loop started, because the loop itself does not modify any variables or change the structure of `ans`.
