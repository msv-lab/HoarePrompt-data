Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `sums` is updated by adding `a[2]` and subtracting `2 * a[x]`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` after the update, `k` is greater than 2**.

Explanation: The code `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `sums` was previously updated by adding `a[2]` and subtracting `2 * a[x]`, the value of `ans` now contains this updated value of `sums`. All other variables retain their previous values.
