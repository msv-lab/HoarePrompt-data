Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `sums` is `sums + a[1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`, `ans` contains the value of `sums` after the update.**

Explanation: The code updates `sums` by adding `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Given `i` is 2, `a[i - 1]` becomes `a[1]`. The value of `i + x - 1` is dependent on the value of `x`, but since `x` is an integer, we express it as `i + x - 1`. Thus, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. The condition checks if `i + x - 1 < n` to decide whether to add `a[0] - 2 * a[x - 1]` or just `a[0]`, but this does not affect the current update. The variable `ans` is set to the new value of `sums` after this update.
