Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is a non-negative integer, `i` is not equal to 0, and the current value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`; `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `sums` by adding `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` to its current value. Since `i` is 0, `a[i - 1]` corresponds to `a[-1]`, which is undefined in Python, but for the sake of this problem, let's assume it is handled appropriately (e.g., by using a default value or handling the index error). The value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, and `x` is a positive integer. The other variables remain unchanged.
