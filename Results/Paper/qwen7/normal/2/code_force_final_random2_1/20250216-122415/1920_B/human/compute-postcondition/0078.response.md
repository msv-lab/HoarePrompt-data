Postcondition: `i` is 1 and `k` is a non-negative integer. If `i` equals 0, the postcondition remains as `sums` being `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` and `ans` containing `[sums]`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1 < n`, then `sums` is updated to `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x - 1]`, and `ans` contains `[sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x - 1]]`. If `i + x - 1` is not less than `n`, then `sums` is `a[0]`, and `ans` contains `[sums]`.
