Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is a non-negative integer, and `i` is not equal to 0, and `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`; `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1]`, `ans` contains `[sums]`**.

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `sums` was previously updated as `sums + a[i - 1]`, the new value of `ans` is a list containing `[sums]`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
