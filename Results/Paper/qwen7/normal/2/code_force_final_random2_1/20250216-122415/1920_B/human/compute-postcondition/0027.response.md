Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is a non-negative integer, `ans` contains either `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x - 1]` if `1 + x - 1 < n`, or `sums + a[0]` if `1 + x - 1 >= n`, where `sums` is defined as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, and `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code updates `sums` by adding `a[i - 1]` to it. Given that `i` was initially 1, `i - 1` is 0, so `sums` is updated to `sums + a[0]`. The other variables (`k` and `ans`) remain unchanged. The condition for `ans` remains the same, but now `sums` is updated to include `a[0]`.
