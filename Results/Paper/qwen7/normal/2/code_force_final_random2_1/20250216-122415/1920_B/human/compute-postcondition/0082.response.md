Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, `ans` contains the value `sums`**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `ans`, it is assumed to be an empty list. After executing the line of code, `ans` now contains the value of `sums`. The values of `i`, `k`, and `sums` remain unchanged from their initial states.
