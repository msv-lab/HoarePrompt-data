Output State: **`i` is 0, `sums` is initialized as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers input by the user, `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a.reverse()` reverses the list `a`. Since `a` was initially sorted, after reversing it becomes a sorted list in descending order. All other variables (`i`, `sums`, `n`, `k`, and `x`) remain unchanged.
