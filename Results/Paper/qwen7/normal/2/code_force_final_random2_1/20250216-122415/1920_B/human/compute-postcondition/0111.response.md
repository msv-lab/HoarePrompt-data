Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, and `sums` is equal to `sums + a[0]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the `sums` variable by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` to it. Given that `i` was initially 0, `i - 1` evaluates to -1. However, since array indices typically start from 0, `a[i - 1]` would refer to the element at index -1, which is not valid unless `a` is a list with negative indexing or the context allows it. Assuming the context allows and `a[-1]` exists, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[-1]`. Additionally, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 1. The values of `x` and `n` remain unchanged.
