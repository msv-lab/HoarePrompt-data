Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, `sums` is `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x - 1]`**

Explanation: The variable `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Given that `i` is 1, `a[i - 1]` becomes `a[0]`. However, the value of `x` is not specified, so `a[i + x - 1]` remains as `a[x - 1]`. Therefore, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x - 1]`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged.
