Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list named `a`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial state.
