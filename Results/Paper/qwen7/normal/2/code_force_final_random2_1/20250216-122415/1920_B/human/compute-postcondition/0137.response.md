Postcondition: `i` is 3, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, and `k` is greater than 2. If `i` equals 0, `ans` is appended with the value of `sums` which is updated to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1 < n`, `sums` is updated by adding `a[2]` and subtracting `2 * a[x]`, and `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums` after the update. If `i + x - 1` is not less than `n`, `sums` is updated by adding `a[2]`, `ans` now contains `[sums]`, and `k` remains greater than 2.
