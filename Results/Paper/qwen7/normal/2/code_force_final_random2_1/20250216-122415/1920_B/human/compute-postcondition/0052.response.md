Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of sorted integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `a` is reversed, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the reversed list `a`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the sum of the elements in the list `a` which was previously reversed. The variable `sum1` is assigned this sum. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `x`, and the state of `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
