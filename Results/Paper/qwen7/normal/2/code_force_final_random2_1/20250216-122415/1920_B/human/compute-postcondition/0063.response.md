Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is a non-negative integer, and `i` is not equal to 0, and `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`; `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the `sums` variable by adding `a[i - 1]` to its current value. Given the initial conditions, `i` is 0, so `a[i - 1]` refers to `a[-1]`, which is not defined in the initial state. However, since the problem specifies to use specific values or expressions, and considering typical array indexing, `a[i - 1]` would refer to the last element of the array `a` (if `a` is an array). But without loss of generality and sticking to the given conditions, we can say `sums` is updated by adding `a[0 - 1]` (which is `a[-1]`) to its current value. Since `i` is not equal to 0, the condition `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n` remains unchanged.
