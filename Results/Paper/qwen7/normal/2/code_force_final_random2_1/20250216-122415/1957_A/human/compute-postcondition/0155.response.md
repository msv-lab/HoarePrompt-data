Output State: **All elements in `pl` have been processed, and `shapes` is the total count of elements `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `shapes` will hold the total number of indices `j` in the list `pl` for which the condition `d[j] >= 3` is true.
