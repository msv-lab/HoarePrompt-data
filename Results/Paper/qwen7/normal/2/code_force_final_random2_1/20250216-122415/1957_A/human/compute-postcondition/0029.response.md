Output State: **`palka` has at least three elements, `i` is the third element in `palka`, `pl` now contains the element `i`, `d[i]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets `d[i]` to 1. Given the initial state, `i` is the third element in `palka`. Since `i` is not specified to be in `pl` initially, it is added to `pl`. The value of `d[i]` is incremented from its previous value (which is assumed to be 0 since no previous value is given) to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
