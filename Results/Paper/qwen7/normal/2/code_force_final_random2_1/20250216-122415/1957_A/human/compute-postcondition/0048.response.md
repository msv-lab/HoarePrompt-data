Output State: **`d[j+1]` is an integer, `shapes` is `shapes + 1` if `d[j+1]` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is the next index in `pl` (which is `j + 1`).**

Explanation: The code `shapes += 1` increments the value of `shapes` by 1. The condition for incrementing `shapes` was that `d[j+1]` should be greater than or equal to 3, but since the code has been executed, we know that the condition was met and `shapes` has been incremented. The other variables remain unchanged.
