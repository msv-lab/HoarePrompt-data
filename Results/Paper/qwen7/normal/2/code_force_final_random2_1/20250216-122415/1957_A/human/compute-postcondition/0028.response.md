Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `palka`.

2. **Understand the postcondition at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `palka` has at least one element (second element).
   - `i` is the second element in `palka`.
   - If `i` is not already in `pl`, then `pl` now contains the element `i`.
   - `d[i]` is either `1` or incremented by `1` depending on its previous value.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the second element in `palka`, the next element in `palka` will be the third element.
   - `pl` will contain `i` if it was not already present.
   - `d[i]` will be incremented by `1` from its previous value.

Given these points, let's construct the new state:

- `palka` will now have at least three elements, and `i` will be the third element in `palka`.
- `pl` will contain `i` if it was not already present.
- `d[i]` will be incremented by `1` from its previous value.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`palka` has at least three elements, `i` is the third element in `palka`, if `i` is not already in `pl`, then `pl` now contains the element `i`, and `d[i]` is incremented by `1` from its previous value**.
