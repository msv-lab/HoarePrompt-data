### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Stick Counting**: For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and their lengths into an array `arr`.
3. **Frequency Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each stick length using a dictionary `freq`.
4. **Polygon Formation**: The function `func_1` aims to determine the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed. However, there is a critical flaw in the logic used to calculate this value.

The function `func_1` currently returns the sum of each frequency divided by 4. This approach assumes that the maximum number of polygons that can be formed is determined solely by the most frequent stick length, which is not necessarily true. For example, consider the following input:

```
3
4
2 2 2 2
3
3 3 3
2
1 2
```

- For the first test case, the function will return `1` because the most frequent stick length (2) has a frequency of 4, and `4 // 4 = 1`. However, we can actually form 2 squares (each with 4 sides), so the correct answer should be `2`.
- For the second test case, the function will return `1` because the most frequent stick length (3) has a frequency of 3, and `3 // 4 = 0`. However, we can actually form 1 triangle (with 3 sides), so the correct answer should be `1`.
- For the third test case, the function will return `0` because the most frequent stick length (1) has a frequency of 1, and `1 // 4 = 0`, but we can actually form 1 polygon (a triangle with sides 1, 2, 2), so the correct answer should be `1`.

The function `func_1` does not account for the possibility of forming polygons with different numbers of sides (e.g., triangles, quadrilaterals, etc.). Instead, it incorrectly assumes that the maximum number of polygons is determined by the most frequent stick length alone.

### Analysis:

- The logic for counting the frequencies is correct.
- However, the method of determining the maximum number of polygons is flawed. It does not consider the possibility of forming polygons with different numbers of sides, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem due to the flawed logic in determining the maximum number of polygons.

### Correctness:

**False**

Final: **False**
