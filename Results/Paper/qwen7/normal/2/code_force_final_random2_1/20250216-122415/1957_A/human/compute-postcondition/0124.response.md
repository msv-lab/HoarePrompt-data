Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `palka`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element `i` in `palka`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `palka` has at least one element.
   - `d` is a dictionary.

4. **Analyze the loop body**: The loop body is omitted, but based on the postcondition, if the key `i` is not in `palka` initially, it will be added to `palka` and the corresponding value in `d` will be incremented by 1. If `i` is already in `palka`, the function does nothing.

5. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in `palka`, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been one of the elements in `palka`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be in `palka` (since the loop iterates over `palka`).

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `palka` remains the same because the loop is iterating over its elements.
   - `d` might have been modified if `i` was not initially in `palka`, but since we are only asked to adjust the states at the start of the next iteration, we don't need to change `d` unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`palka` has at least one element, `d` is a dictionary, and `i` is an element in `palka`**.
