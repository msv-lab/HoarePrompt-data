Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `n` and the iterable `arr`.
2. **Determine the initial state of `n`**: Since `n` is being iterated over using `arr`, `n` will take on the values from the list `arr` one by one.
3. **Initial state of `arr`**: The list `arr` contains integers representing the lengths of sticks, and its length indicates the number of sticks available.
4. **Determine the initial state of `freq`**: The dictionary `freq` is initially empty.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the loop can execute by adjusting the states of the relevant objects. Specifically, we need to ensure that the list `arr` is not empty, as the loop will iterate over each element in `arr`.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

- The loop will execute as long as `arr` is not empty.
- Initially, `arr` is a list of integers, and its length indicates the number of sticks available.
- `freq` is an empty dictionary, which does not affect the loop's execution directly.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `arr` is not empty.

**State:**
**`arr` is a non-empty list of integers where each integer represents the length of a stick, and the length of the list is the number of sticks available (1 <= n <= 100); freq is an empty dictionary.**
