Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_1` calculates the number of regular polygons that can be formed by summing up the integer divisions of the frequencies of stick lengths by 4. However, this approach is incorrect because it assumes that every set of four sticks of the same length can form a polygon, which is not necessarily true. For example, having multiple sets of three sticks of the same length should allow forming triangles, but the current implementation does not account for this.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to find the maximum number of complete polygons (triangles, squares, etc.) that can be formed. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    
    max_polygons = 0
    while True:
        min_side = min(freq.values())
        if min_side == 0:
            break
        max_polygons += min_side // 3  # Triangles
        max_polygons += min_side // 4  # Squares
        max_polygons += min_side // 5  # Pentagons
        # Add more conditions for higher polygons if needed
        
        for k in freq.keys():
            freq[k] -= min_side
    
    return max_polygons
```

This corrected function iteratively finds the minimum frequency of any stick length and uses that to determine how many complete polygons can be formed, updating the frequencies accordingly. This ensures that all possible polygons are considered and the maximum number of polygons is calculated accurately.
