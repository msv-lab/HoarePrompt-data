Output State: **`i` is `palka[0]`, `palka` is a non-empty list, and `d.get(i)` is not `None`; `d[i]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `d[i] += 1` increments the value of `d[i]` by 1. Given the initial conditions, `i` is the first element of the list `palka`, `palka` is non-empty, and `d.get(i)` is not `None`. The other variables remain unchanged.
