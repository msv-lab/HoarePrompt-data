Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where multiple polygons can be formed with different side lengths. For example, in the last test case, the input `9\n4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4` should result in `2` because we can form a pentagon with side length `2` and a square with side length `4`. However, the current implementation only counts the maximum frequency of any stick length and divides it by 4, which will result in `1` in this case. This approach fails to consider forming multiple polygons with different side lengths.
