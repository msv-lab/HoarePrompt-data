Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `j` and `pl`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `pl` and the current value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `shapes` is 2.
   - `pl` must have at least one element.
   - The current value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, where `j` is the next element in `pl`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is the next element in `pl`, it means `j` was the last element processed in the previous iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `pl` must still have at least one element (since `pl` must have at least one element and we are processing the next element).
   - The value of `d[j]` must still be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to continue.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `shapes` remains unchanged at 2.
   - `pl` must have at least one element, but since `j` was the last element processed, `pl` now has no elements left to process.
   - Therefore, `pl` must be empty for the loop to stop.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: `shapes` is 2, `pl` must be empty, and the current value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, where `j` is the next element in `pl` (which does not exist)**.

However, since `pl` must be empty for the loop to stop, the correct state adjustment is:

**State: `shapes` is 2, `pl` must be empty**.
