You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100 represents the lengths of the sticks.
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        pl = []
        
        d = {}
        
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        
        shapes = 0
        
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += 1
        
        print(shapes)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `shapes` will be the total count of elements in `palka` across all inputs provided during the loop iterations that have a count of occurrences of 3 or more in the list `palka`. The variable `pl` will contain all unique elements from all `palka` lists combined, and `d` will be a dictionary where each key is an element from any of the `palka` lists and the value is the total count of occurrences of that element across all `palka` lists. The loop processes each unique element in `pl`, checks if its count in `d` is 3 or more, and if so, increments `shapes` by 1. The final value of `shapes` will be the sum of all such increments across all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case defined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), where for each test case, an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks are provided. The function returns information based on these inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
