Based on the initial state provided:

- The final value of `shapes` is determined by the number of elements in `pl` for which the condition `d[j] >= 3` is true.

Since the exact content of `pl` and `d` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `shapes`. However, we know that `shapes` represents the count of elements in `pl` where the corresponding element in `d` is greater than or equal to 3.

Therefore, the print statement will output this count.

Output: **shapes (where shapes is the count of elements in pl for which d[j] >= 3)**
