Output State: **`palka` has at least three elements, `i` is the third element in `palka`, `pl` now contains the element `i`, and `d[i]` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `pl` now has one more element which is `i`.**

Explanation: The code `pl.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `pl`. Since `i` is the third element in `palka`, appending `i` to `pl` means `pl` now contains `i` and has one more element than before. All other conditions remain the same.
