Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` is an input integer, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `palka` has at least one element, `i` is the first element in `palka`. If `i` is in `pl`, the function does nothing. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `i` is appended to `pl` and `d[i]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `palka` has at least one element (second element), `i` is the second element in `palka`; if `i` is not already in `pl`, then `pl` now contains the element `i`; `d[i]` is either `1` or incremented by `1` depending on its previous value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `palka` has at least three elements, `i` is the third element in `palka`, `pl` now contains the element `i`, and `d[i]` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `pl` remains unchanged as it does not gain any new elements since `i` is already in `pl`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
