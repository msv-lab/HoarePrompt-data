Output State: **`palka` is a non-empty list with the first element being the second element of the original `palka` list, and `d` is a dictionary containing the key-value pair `{second_element_of_palka: 2, i: 1}`.**

Explanation: The code `d[i] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `i`, it remains as `i` in the dictionary. The list `palka` and its first element remain unchanged from the initial state.
