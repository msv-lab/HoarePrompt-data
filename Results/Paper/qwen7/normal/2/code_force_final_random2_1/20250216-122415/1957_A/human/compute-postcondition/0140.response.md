Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `palka` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the original `palka` list and its value is the count of occurrences of that element in the list. The variable `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from the original `palka` list. The variable `shapes` is an integer representing the number of keys in `d` whose values are greater than or equal to 3.**

This means that after the loop completes, `palka` will be empty because all elements have been processed. The dictionary `d` will contain each unique element from the original `palka` as a key, with the value being the count of how many times that element appeared in the list. The list `pl` will contain all unique elements from the original `palka` in the order they were first encountered. Finally, the variable `shapes` will hold the count of how many keys in `d` have a value of 3 or more.
