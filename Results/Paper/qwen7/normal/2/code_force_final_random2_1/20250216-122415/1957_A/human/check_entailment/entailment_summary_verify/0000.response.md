### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary against the problem description and the given examples.

1. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list of integers (`arr`) as input.
   - It calculates the frequency of each stick length using a dictionary `freq`.
   - It then returns the sum of each frequency divided by 4.

2. **Problem Description and Examples**:
   - We need to find the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed simultaneously, where each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick and no stick is used more than once.
   - The key point here is to maximize the number of polygons, not just the largest possible polygon.

3. **Current Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts the frequency of each stick length.
   - It then returns the sum of these frequencies divided by 4, which effectively gives the maximum number of polygons that can be formed with the given stick lengths.

4. **Examples Analysis**:
   - **Example 1**: Input: `1\n1`
     - Output: `0`
     - Explanation: Only one stick, so no polygons can be formed.
   - **Example 2**: Input: `2\n1 1`
     - Output: `0`
     - Explanation: Two sticks of length 1, but they are not enough to form any polygon.
   - **Example 3**: Input: `6\n2 2 3 3 3 3`
     - Output: `1`
     - Explanation: Four sticks of length 3 can form one square.
   - **Example 4**: Input: `9\n4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4`
     - Output: `2`
     - Explanation: We can form one pentagon with side length 2 and one square with side length 4.

5. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment stated that the program does not handle the case where multiple polygons can be formed with different side lengths. However, the current implementation correctly handles this by considering all stick lengths and counting the maximum number of polygons that can be formed.

Given the analysis, the current implementation correctly handles the problem requirements and examples provided. The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the function.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description and the provided examples.
