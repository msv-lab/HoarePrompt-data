Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing stick lengths. It counts the number of unique stick lengths that appear 3 or more times across all test cases and prints this count. The function does not return any value but outputs the count of such unique stick lengths for each test case.**
