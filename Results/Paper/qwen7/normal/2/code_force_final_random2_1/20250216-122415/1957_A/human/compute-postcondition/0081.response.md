Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `palka` is a non-empty list.
- The first element of `palka` is the second element of the original `palka` list.
- `d` is a dictionary.
- If the second element of the original `palka` is not in `d`, then `d` now contains the key-value pair `{second_element_of_palka: 1}`.
- If the second element of the original `palka` is already in `d`, then `d[second_element_of_palka]` is incremented by 1.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in palka:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each element in `palka`.
- The variable `i` takes on the value of each element in `palka` during each iteration.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Initial Values:**
   - `palka` is a non-empty list.
   - The first element of `palka` is the second element of the original `palka` list.
   - `d` is a dictionary.

2. **First Iteration (i = first element of palka):**
   - Since `i` is the first element of `palka`, it is the second element of the original `palka` list.
   - Check if `i` is in `d`:
     - If `i` is not in `d`, add `{i: 1}` to `d`.
     - If `i` is in `d`, increment `d[i]` by 1.

3. **Second Iteration (i = second element of palka):**
   - Now, `i` is the second element of the original `palka` list.
   - Check if `i` is in `d`:
     - If `i` is not in `d`, add `{i: 1}` to `d`.
     - If `i` is in `d`, increment `d[i]` by 1.

4. **Subsequent Iterations:**
   - For each subsequent element in `palka`, repeat the same check and update `d` accordingly.

### Final State Before the Next Iteration:
- `palka` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `d` is updated based on the current value of `i`.

### Adjusted State:
- The first element of `palka` is still the second element of the original `palka` list.
- `d` is updated according to the value of `i` (the second element of the original `palka`).

### Final Answer:
State: **`palka` is a non-empty list with the first element being the second element of the original `palka` list, and `d` is a dictionary that may contain the key-value pair `{second_element_of_palka: count}` where `count` is the number of times the second element of the original `palka` appears in `palka`.** 

However, since we need to specify the exact state for the next iteration, we focus on the elements that change:

State: **`palka` is a non-empty list with the first element being the second element of the original `palka` list, and `d` is a dictionary that may contain the key-value pair `{second_element_of_palka: 2}` if the second element of the original `palka` appeared twice in `palka`. Otherwise, `d` may contain `{second_element_of_palka: 1}` or no such entry if it did not appear before.**

For clarity, let's assume the second element of the original `palka` appeared twice in `palka`:

State: **`palka` is a non-empty list with the first element being the second element of the original `palka` list, and `d` is a dictionary containing the key-value pair `{second_element_of_palka: 2}`.**
