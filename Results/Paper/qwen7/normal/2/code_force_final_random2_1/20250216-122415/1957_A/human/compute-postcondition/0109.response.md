Output State: **`ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers created from the input, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary, the final value of `shapes` is determined by the number of elements in `palka` for which the condition `d[j] >= 3` is true.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty dictionary `d`. This does not affect the values of `ln`, `palka`, `pl`, or the calculation of `shapes`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
