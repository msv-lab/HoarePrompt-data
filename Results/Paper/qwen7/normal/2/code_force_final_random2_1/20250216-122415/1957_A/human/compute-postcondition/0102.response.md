Postcondition: **`shapes` is 2, `pl` must have at least one remaining element, and the next value of `d[j]` must be greater than or equal to 3, where `j` is the next element in `pl`. If `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` becomes 3.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. It indicates that `shapes` remains 2 unless `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, in which case it becomes 3. Additionally, `pl` must still have at least one remaining element, and the next value of `d[j]` must be greater than or equal to 3.
