Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `L` is 50001, `i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, `R` is 100001, `x` is 75001, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`**

The code `leftover = dfs(1, 1)` assigns the result of the function `dfs(1, 1)` to the variable `leftover`. However, since the function `dfs` is not defined and no specific value is provided for `dfs(1, 1)`, the exact value of `leftover` cannot be determined. Therefore, the only change is that `leftover` now holds the result of `dfs(1, 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
