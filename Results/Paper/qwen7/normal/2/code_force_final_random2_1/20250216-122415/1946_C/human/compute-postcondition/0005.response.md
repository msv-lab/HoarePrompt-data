Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `x` is 1, `R` is 100001, `z` is 0, `k` is an integer from the second space-separated input, `adj` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements, each element being an empty list, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input.**

The code reads two integers from the standard input using `sys.stdin.readline().split()` and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. The values of `t`, `x`, `R`, `z`, `n`, `k`, and `adj` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new variables `a` and `b` are assigned the values of the first and second integers from the input, respectively.
