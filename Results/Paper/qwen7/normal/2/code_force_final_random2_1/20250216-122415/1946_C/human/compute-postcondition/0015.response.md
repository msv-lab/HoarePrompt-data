Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `x` is 1, `R` is 100001, `z` is 0, `k` is an integer from the second space-separated input, `adj` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements, each element being an empty list except for the element at index `a` which now contains `[b, a]` and `[b]`, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, `i` is 5, `n` is the same as before, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, `adj[b]` now contains `a`.**

Explanation: The code `adj[b].append(a)` appends the value `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Since `a` and `b` are the first and second integers from the input respectively, and `adj` is structured such that `adj[a]` contains `[b, a]` and `[b]`, appending `a` to `adj[b]` modifies the list `adj[b]` to include `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
