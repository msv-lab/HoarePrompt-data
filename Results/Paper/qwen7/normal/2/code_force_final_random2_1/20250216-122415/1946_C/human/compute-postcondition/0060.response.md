Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is the integer input converted to int, `b` is the second integer input converted to int, `adj[a]` contains the value `[a, b]`**

Explanation: The code appends `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Initially, `adj[b]` contained the value `[a]`. After executing `adj[a].append(b)`, the list `adj[a]` now contains both `a` and `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
