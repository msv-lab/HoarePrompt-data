Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of dfs(1, 1), `x` is now the integer division of `(L + R)` by 2, and `R` is equal to `x`.**

Explanation: The code `R = x` assigns the value of `x` to `R`. The value of `x` is the integer division of `(L + R)` by 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
