Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `x` is 50005, `R` is 100001, `z` is 0, `k` is an integer from the second space-separated input, `adj` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements, each element being an empty list except for the elements at indices `a` and `b` which contain each other, `a` and `b` are the integers from the inputs, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `L` is 1, `numCuts` is 0**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` to be the integer division of `(L + R)` by 2. Given that `L` is 1 and `R` is 100001, `(L + R)` equals 100002. Dividing 100002 by 2 gives 50001. Since integer division truncates the decimal part, `x` is set to 50005. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
