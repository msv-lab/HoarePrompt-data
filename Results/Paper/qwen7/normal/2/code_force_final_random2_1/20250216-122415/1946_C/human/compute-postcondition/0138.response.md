Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `R` is `x`, `leftover` is the return value of `dfs(1, 1)`**

Explanation: The variable `R` is assigned the value of `x`. The values of `numCuts` and `leftover` remain unchanged from their initial states. `numCuts` was initially 0, and `leftover` was the return value of the function `dfs(1, 1)`.
