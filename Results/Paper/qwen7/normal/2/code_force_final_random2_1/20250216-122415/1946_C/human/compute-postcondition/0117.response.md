Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `R - L > 1`.
2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `numCuts` is 0 (not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `L` is 1.
   - `i` is `n-2` (not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `n` is greater than 1 (not directly affecting the loop condition).
   - `R` is 100001.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustment**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `R - L > 1` must be true.
   - Currently, `L` is 1 and `R` is 100001.
   - Since `100001 - 1 = 100000`, which is indeed greater than 1, no adjustment is needed for `L` or `R`.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The current values of `L` and `R` already satisfy the loop condition, so no adjustments are necessary.

Therefore, the state right before the loop remains unchanged.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`numCuts` is 0, `L` is 1, `i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, `R` is 100001**
