Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `x` is 1, `R` is 100001, `z` is 0, `n` is an integer from the first space-separated input, `k` is an integer from the second space-separated input, `adj` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements, each element being an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list of lists named `adj` with `n + 1` elements, where each element is an empty list. This does not affect the values of `t`, `x`, `R`, `z`, `n`, or `k`.
