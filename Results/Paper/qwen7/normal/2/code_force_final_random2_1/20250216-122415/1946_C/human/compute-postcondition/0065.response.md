Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `a` is the first integer input converted to int, `b` is the second integer input converted to int, `adj[b]` contains the value `[b, a, a]` and `adj[a]` now contains the value `[a, b]`**

Explanation: The code appends `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Initially, `adj[b]` contained `[b, a]`. After appending `a` again, `adj[b]` becomes `[b, a, a]`. The values of `i`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The condition `n` is greater than 3 also remains valid.
