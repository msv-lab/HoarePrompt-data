Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `L` is 1, `i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, `R` is 100001, `x` is 50001**

Explanation: The code `numCuts = 0` simply reassigns the value of `numCuts` to 0. Since `numCuts` was already 0 in the initial state, this assignment does not change its value. All other variables (`L`, `i`, `n`, `R`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
