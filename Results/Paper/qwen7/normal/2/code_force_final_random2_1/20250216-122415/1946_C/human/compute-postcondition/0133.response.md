Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `R - L > 1`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `numCuts` is 0
   - `L` is either 50001 or 75001
   - `i` is `n-2`
   - `n` is greater than 1
   - `R` is either 75001 or 100001
   - `x` is 75001
   - `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`

3. **Determine which states need adjustment**:
   - The loop condition depends on `R` and `L`. Therefore, we need to adjust these two variables.
   - Since `R - L > 1` must hold true for the loop to continue, we need to ensure that `R - L` is still greater than 1.

4. **Analyze the current values**:
   - If `L` is 50001 and `R` is 75001, then `R - L = 25000`, which is greater than 1.
   - If `L` is 50001 and `R` is 100001, then `R - L = 50000`, which is also greater than 1.
   - If `L` is 75001 and `R` is 100001, then `R - L = 25000`, which is greater than 1.

Given that the loop condition `R - L > 1` is already satisfied with the current values, we need to ensure that the loop can continue to the next iteration. This means we should keep `R - L > 1` true.

Since `R` and `L` are the only variables in the loop head, and they must satisfy the condition `R - L > 1`, no adjustments are necessary as long as `R` and `L` maintain their current values.

Therefore, the state remains the same as the current state at the end of the previous iteration.

**State:**
**`numCuts` is 0, `L` is either 50001 or 75001, `i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, `R` is either 75001 or 100001, `x` is 75001, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`**
