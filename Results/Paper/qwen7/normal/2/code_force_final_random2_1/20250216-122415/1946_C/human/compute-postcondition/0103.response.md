Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is the first integer entered, `b` is the second integer entered, `adj[a]` now contains `b`.**

Explanation: The code `adj[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Since `a` is the first integer entered and `b` is the second integer entered, `adj[a]` will now contain `b`. The values of `i`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
