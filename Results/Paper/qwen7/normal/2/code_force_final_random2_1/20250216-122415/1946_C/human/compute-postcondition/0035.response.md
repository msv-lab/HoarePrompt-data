Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of dfs(1, 1), `x` is now the integer division of `(L + R)` by 2, and `R` is greater than `L` by more than 1.**

Explanation: The function `dfs(1, 1)` is called, and its return value is assigned to `leftover`. The values of `numCuts`, `x`, and `R` relative to `L` remain unchanged from their initial state.
