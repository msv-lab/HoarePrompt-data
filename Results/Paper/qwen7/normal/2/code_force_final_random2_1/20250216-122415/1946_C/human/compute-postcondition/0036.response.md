Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of dfs(1, 1), `L` is now the integer division of `(L + R)` by 2, and `R` is greater than `L` by more than 1.**

Explanation: The code `L = x` assigns the value of `x` to `L`. The value of `x` is defined as the integer division of `(L + R)` by 2. Since `L` and `R` are already defined in the initial state with `R` being greater than `L` by more than 1, the new value of `L` is calculated as `(L + R) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
