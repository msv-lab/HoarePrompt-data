Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n - 1`, `n` is an integer from the input, and for every pair of integers `(a, b)` provided as input, both `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` will contain each other, making the adjacency list fully populated according to the inputs.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will have the value `n - 1`, indicating that the loop has executed `n - 1` times. The adjacency list `adj` will be completely filled such that for every edge `(a, b)` specified in the input, both `a` and `b` will appear in each other's adjacency lists, forming a connected graph based on the given edges.
