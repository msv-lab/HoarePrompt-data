Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer from the input, `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, `adj[b]` contains the value `[a]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Initially, `adj[b]` contains the value `b`. After executing the line `adj[b].append(a)`, `adj[b]` will now contain the list `[b, a]`. However, since the initial state only mentions that `adj[b]` contains the value `b`, and we are appending `a` to it, the updated state of `adj[b]` is `[a]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
