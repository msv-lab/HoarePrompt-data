Output State: **`L` is 1, `R` is 50001, `x` is 50001, `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is `dfs(1, 1)`**

Explanation: The code snippet `R = x` updates the value of `R` to be equal to `x`. Given that `x` is 50001, `R` is now 50001. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated values are as stated above.
