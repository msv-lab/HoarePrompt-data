Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is greater than 1
   - `a` is the first integer entered
   - `b` is the second integer entered
   - `adj[b]` now contains `[a]`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i` in `range(n - 1)`.
   - This means the loop will run as long as `i < n - 1`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.

4. **Condition for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently 0, it is indeed less than `n - 1` (because `n` is greater than 1).

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - The variable `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 1.
   - The condition for `n` remains the same: `n` must still be greater than 1.
   - The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.
   - The list `adj[b]` will now contain `[a]` because no changes are made to it within the loop body (as per the given information).

6. **Final State:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `a` remains the first integer entered
   - `b` remains the second integer entered
   - `adj[b]` still contains `[a]`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is the first integer entered, `b` is the second integer entered, `adj[b]` contains `[a]***
