Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` is greater than 3; `a` is an integer from the input; `b` is an integer from the input; `adj[b]` now contains `a`.**

Explanation: The code `adj[b].append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Since `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input, and `adj[a]` was previously set to `b`, the list `adj[b]` now includes the value `a`. The other variables (`i`, `n`) remain unchanged.
