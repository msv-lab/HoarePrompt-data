Output State: `numCuts` is 0, `L` is 50001, `R` is 50001, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the binary search process converges such that `L` and `R` become equal, both set to 50001. Since `numCuts` remains 0 throughout the iterations and the condition `numCuts > k` or `(numCuts == k and leftover >= x)` is never satisfied, `L` and `R` will meet exactly at 50001. The variable `x` is the final midpoint value, which is 50001. The `leftover` value is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, which does not change within the loop. All other variables outside the loop, such as `z`, `k`, `adj`, `i`, and `n`, remain unchanged from their initial or previous states.
