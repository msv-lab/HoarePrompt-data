Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` is the first integer input converted to int, `b` is the second integer input converted to int, `adj[b]` contains the value `[b, a]`**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the standard input using `sys.stdin.readline().split()` and then converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. These two integers are then assigned to `a` and `b` respectively. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 3 is still valid. The `adj[b]` list is updated to contain the values `[b, a]`.
