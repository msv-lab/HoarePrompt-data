Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `L` and `R` must be adjusted such that `R - L > 1`, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`**

Explanation: The code simply reassigns `numCuts` to 0, which does not affect the values of `L`, `R`, or `x`. Therefore, the conditions and values of `L` and `R` remain unchanged, and `x` is still calculated as `(L + R) // 2`.
