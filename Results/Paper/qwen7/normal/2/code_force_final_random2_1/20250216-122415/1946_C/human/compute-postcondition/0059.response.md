Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is the integer input converted to int, `b` is the second integer input converted to int, `adj[b]` contains the value `[a]`**.

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the standard input using `sys.stdin.readline().split()` and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. These integers are then assigned to `a` and `b`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state. The `adj` list is updated such that `adj[b]` now contains the value `[a]`.
