Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `L` is 1, `i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, `R` is 100001.**

Explanation: The line `numCuts = 0` initializes the variable `numCuts` to 0. No other changes are made to the variables `L`, `i`, `n`, or `R`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial values from the initial state.
