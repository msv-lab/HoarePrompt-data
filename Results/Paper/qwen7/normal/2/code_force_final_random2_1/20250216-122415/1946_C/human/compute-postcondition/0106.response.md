Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is the integer entered as the first number, `b` is the integer entered as the second number, `adj[b]` contains `[a]`**.

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the standard input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. It does not affect the values of `i` or `n`. The value of `adj[b]` is updated to include `[a]`.
