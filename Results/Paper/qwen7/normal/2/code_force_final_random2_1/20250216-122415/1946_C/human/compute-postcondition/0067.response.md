Output State: **`L` is 1**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `L` to 1. No other variables are affected, and the conditions specified in the initial state remain unchanged. Therefore, after executing the line `L = 1`, the value of `L` is 1, and `i` is still equal to `n - 1`, with `n` being an integer from the input, and the adjacency list `adj` is fully populated according to the inputs.
