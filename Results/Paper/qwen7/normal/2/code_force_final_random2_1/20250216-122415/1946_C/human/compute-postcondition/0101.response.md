Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(n - 1)`.
2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The variable `i` starts from 0 in the `range` function.
3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n - 1`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

Given this information, let's adjust the states accordingly:

- `i` should be set to 0 (the starting value).
- `n` must be greater than 1 (since `i < n - 1` implies `n > 1`).

The other variables (`L`, `R`, `numCuts`, `x`, `leftover`, `k`, and `adj`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1**
