Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `x` is 1, `R` is 100001, `z` is 0, `k` is an integer from the second space-separated input, `adj` is a list of lists with `n + 1` elements, each element being an empty list except for the element at index `a` which now contains `[b, a]` and `[b]`, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, `i` is 5, `n` is the same as before, `a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input.**

Explanation: The code appends `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Initially, `adj[a]` contains `[b, a]` and `[b]`. After executing the line `adj[a].append(b)`, `adj[a]` will contain `[b, a], [b], [b]`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 5. All other variables remain unchanged.
