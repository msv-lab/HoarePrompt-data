Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1.
- `a` is now `a - 1`.
- `b` is an integer from the input.
- `s` is the value of the list `p` at index `b - 1` minus the value of the list `p` at index `a - 2`.

The print statement is:

```python
print('NO')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'NO'` without any dependency on the values of `m`, `a`, `b`, or `s`.

Output: **NO**
