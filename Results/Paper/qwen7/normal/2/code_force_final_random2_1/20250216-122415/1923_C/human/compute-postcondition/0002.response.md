Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated input, `m` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated input, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the remaining space-separated inputs.**

The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a single line of input, splits it into space-separated values, converts each value to an integer using `map(int, ...)` and then creates a list `l` from these integers. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
