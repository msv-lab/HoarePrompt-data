Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1.
- `a` is the first integer input minus 1.
- `b` is the second integer input.
- `s` is the value of the list `p` at index `b - 1`.
- If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `a` is further decremented by 2.

The `print('YES')` statement will simply print the string "YES".

Output: **YES**
