Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically an underscore used as a throwaway variable) and the variable `m` (which determines the number of iterations).

2. **Determine the initial state needed for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute `m` times. Therefore, the value of `m` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

3. **Consider the final state after the loop completes**: After the loop completes all its iterations, `c` will be the sum of all elements in `l`, and `p` will be a list containing each cumulative sum of `c` for each iteration of the loop. However, since we are only concerned with the state at the start of the loop, we do not need to consider the final values of `c` or `p`.

4. **Adjust the state accordingly**: The only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `m` to ensure the loop can execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `m` must be greater than 0.

**State: **`m` must be greater than 0**
