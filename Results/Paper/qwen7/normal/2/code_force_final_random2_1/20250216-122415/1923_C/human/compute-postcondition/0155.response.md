Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `m` is 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `l` is a list of integers.
- `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all elements in `l`.
- `c` is 0.
- `s` is calculated as follows:
  - If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `s = p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.
  - Otherwise, `s = p[b - 1]`.
  - `s` is then decreased by `p[a - 2]` if `a - 2 >= 0`.

The print statement is simply `print('YES')`.

Since the print statement is not dependent on the values of any variables but is a fixed string, the output will be exactly as written.

Output: **YES**
