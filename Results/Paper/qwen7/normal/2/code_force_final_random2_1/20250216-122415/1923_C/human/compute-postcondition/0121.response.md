Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the values of `c` after each iteration plus an additional element which is the value of `c + x`, `c` is increased by the next element from the list `l`**.

Explanation: The code snippet `p.append(c)` appends the current value of `c` to the list `p`. The value of `c` is increased by the next element from the list `l` after this operation. All other variables remain unchanged.
