The only object in the loop head is the variable `m`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `m` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than 1.

Given that `m` must be decremented by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the last iteration, `m` must be 1 to allow for one more iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `m` should be adjusted to 1.

State: **`m` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and `s` is equal to the value of `p[a - 2] - p[b - 1]`**
