Output State: **`l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element; `c` is increased by `x`.**

The code `c += x` increments the value of `c` by the value of `x`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `c` and `x`, we only know that `c` is increased by `x`. The list `l` remains unchanged.
