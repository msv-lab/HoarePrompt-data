Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` is explicitly given as 1.
- `a` and `b` are input integers.
- `s` is defined as `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]` if `a - 2 >= 0`. Otherwise, the values of `m`, `a`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged.

The print statement is:
```python
print('YES')
```

The print statement directly outputs the string `'YES'` without referencing any variables or objects whose values might change based on conditions. Therefore, the output is simply the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
