Postcondition: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all elements in `l`, `c` is 0, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]` if `a - 2 >= 0`. If `a - 2 < 0`, the value of `s` remains unchanged.
