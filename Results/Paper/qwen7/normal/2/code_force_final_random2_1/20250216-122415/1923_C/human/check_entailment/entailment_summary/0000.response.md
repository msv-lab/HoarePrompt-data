Reasoning:
1. The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the cumulative sums of the array `c` and then checking if the sum of elements in each queried subarray is at least twice the length of the subarray.
2. However, the logic used to determine if a subarray is "good" is flawed. A subarray being "good" requires the existence of another array `b` that meets specific conditions, which is not directly checked in the provided code.
3. The condition `if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):` only checks if the sum of the subarray is at least twice its length, but it does not ensure that the subarray can be transformed into a "good" array `b` with the required properties.
4. The program does not account for the fact that the elements of `b` must be distinct from those of `a` and all positive, which is a crucial part of the definition of a "good" array.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if a subarray is "good" according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
