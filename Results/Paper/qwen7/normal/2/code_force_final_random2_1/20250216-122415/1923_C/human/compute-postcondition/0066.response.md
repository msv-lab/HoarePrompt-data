Output State: **`l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element (one less than before), `c` is increased by the next element in `l`, `p` is a list containing the value of `c` appended.**

This means that the value of `c` is increased by the next element from the list `l`. After this operation, `p` is updated to be a list that contains the new value of `c`. The length of `l` is reduced by one because the next element was taken from it.
