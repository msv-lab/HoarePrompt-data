Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in l:`. This means the loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `l`.

2. **Determine the State After the Previous Iteration**:
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is an input integer.
   - `m` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element.
   - `p` is a list containing the value of `c`.
   - `c` is updated as `c + x` within the loop.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `l`.
   - After the previous iteration, `l` must still have at least one element for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - `x` will be the next element from the list `l`.
   - `c` will be updated to `c + x` during the current iteration.
   - `l` will be modified to remove the first element (since it was just processed).

Given these points, let's update the states:

- `a` remains unchanged.
- `b` remains unchanged.
- `m` remains 1.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `l` will now have one less element (the first element is removed).
- `p` will contain the updated value of `c` from the previous iteration.
- `c` will be updated to `c + x` for the next iteration.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `p` is a list containing the value of `c` after the previous iteration, `c` is `c + x`**
