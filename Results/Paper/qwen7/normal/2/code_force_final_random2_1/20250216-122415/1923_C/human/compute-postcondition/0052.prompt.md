Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all iterations, `c` will be the sum of all elements in `l`, `p` will be a list containing each cumulative sum of `c` for each iteration of the loop.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    s = p[b - 1]
    if a - 2 >= 0:
        s -= p[a - 2]
    if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `s` is the value of the list `p` at index `b - 1` decreased by the value of the list `p` at index `a - 2`, and the current value of `a` is greater than or equal to 2. If `b - a + 1` is greater than 1 and `s` is greater than or equal to twice the value of `b - a + 1`, then the conditions remain as they are. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1` is less than or equal to 1 or `s` is less than `2 * (b - a + 1)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `m` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `a` is now `a - 1`, `b` is an integer from the input, `s` is the value of the list `p` at index `b - 1` minus the value of the list `p` at index `a - 2`. This holds true whether the condition `b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` is satisfied or not.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `m` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `a` is the first integer input - 1, `b` is the second integer input, `s` is the value of the list `p` at index `b - 1`. If `a - 2 >= 0`, then `a` is further decremented by 2. This holds true regardless of whether the if condition `b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` is satisfied or not.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
