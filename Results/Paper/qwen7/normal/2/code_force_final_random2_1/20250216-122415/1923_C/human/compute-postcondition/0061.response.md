Output State: **`l` is a list of integers that must have at least one element; `c` is increased by `x`; `p` is a list containing the value of `c`.**

Explanation: The code `p.append(c)` appends the value of `c` to the list `p`. Since `c` is increased by `x`, the value of `c` is now `c + x`. The initial state of `l` and the fact that `c` is increased by `x` remain unchanged, but now `p` is a list containing the updated value of `c`.
