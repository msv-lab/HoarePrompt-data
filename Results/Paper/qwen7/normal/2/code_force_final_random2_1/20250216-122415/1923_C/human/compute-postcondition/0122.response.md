Output State: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all elements in `l`, `c` is 0.

In this final output state, `p` will contain the cumulative sum of all elements in the list `l` because the loop iterates over each element in `l`, adding it to `c` and appending the updated value of `c` to `p`. After all iterations, `c` will be reset to 0 since it is reinitialized before each full pass through the loop, but `p` will retain the list of cumulative sums. The other variables (`a`, `b`, `m`, and `n`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
