Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer decreased by 1, `b` is an input integer, `s` is equal to the value of `p[b - 1]` decreased by the value of `p[a - 2]`, and the current value of `a` is greater than or equal to 1, and either `b - a + 1` is less than or equal to 1 or `s` is less than `2 * (b - a + 1)`.
