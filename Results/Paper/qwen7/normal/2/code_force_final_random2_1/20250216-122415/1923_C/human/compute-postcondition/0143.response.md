Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all elements in `l`, `c` is 0, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`**

Explanation: The code `s -= p[a - 2]` subtracts the value of `p[a - 2]` from `s`. Given that `s` was initially equal to `p[b - 1]`, after executing the code, `s` becomes `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
