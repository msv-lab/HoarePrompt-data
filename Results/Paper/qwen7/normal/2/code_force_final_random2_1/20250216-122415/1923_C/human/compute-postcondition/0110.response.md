Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `p` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `p`. No other changes are made to the existing variables. Therefore, the values of `a`, `b`, `m`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged, and `p` is set to an empty list.
