Postcondition: `m` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `a` is now `a - 1`, `b` is an integer from the input, `s` is the value of the list `p` at index `b - 1` minus the value of the list `p` at index `a - 2`. This holds true whether the condition `b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)` is met or not.
