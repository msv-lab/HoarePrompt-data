Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `s` is the value of the list `p` at index `b - 1` decreased by the value of the list `p` at index `a - 2`, and the current value of `a` is greater than or equal to 2. If `b - a + 1` is greater than 1 and `s` is greater than or equal to twice the value of `b - a + 1`, then the conditions remain as they are. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1` is less than or equal to 1 or `s` is less than `2 * (b - a + 1)`.
