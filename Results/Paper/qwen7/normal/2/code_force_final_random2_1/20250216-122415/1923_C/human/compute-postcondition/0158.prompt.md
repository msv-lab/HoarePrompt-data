Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all elements in `l`, `c` is 0.

In natural language: After the loop executes all its iterations, `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop. The variable `m` remains 1. `n` also remains unchanged. The list `l` remains the same as it was initially provided. The list `p` contains the cumulative sums of all elements in `l`, starting from 0 (i.e., `c`), with each subsequent element in `p` being the sum of all elements in `l` up to that point. The variable `c` is reset to 0 after the loop completes.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    s = p[b - 1]
    if a - 2 >= 0:
        s -= p[a - 2]
    if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all elements in `l`, `c` is 0, `s` is the cumulative sum of the first `b-1` elements in `l` minus the element at index `a-2` in list `p` if `a - 2 >= 0`. Otherwise, `s` remains the cumulative sum of the first `b-1` elements in `l`. Additionally, if the condition `(b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1))` is true, then the condition holds as specified in the if part. Otherwise, either `b - a + 1 <= 1` or `s < 2 * (b - a + 1)` holds true.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all elements in `l`, `c` is 0, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]` if `a - 2 >= 0`. If `a - 2 < 0`, the value of `s` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers, `p` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all elements in `l`, `c` is 0, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]` if `a - 2 >= 0`, otherwise `s` is equal to `p[b - 1]`, and `s` is decreased by `p[a - 2]` if `a - 2 >= 0`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
