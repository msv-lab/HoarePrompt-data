Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers**.

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list named `l`. The initial values of `a`, `b`, `m`, and `n` remain unchanged.
