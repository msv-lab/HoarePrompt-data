Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `b` is a list

4. **Loop body behavior**:
   - If the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'L', then `b` contains one element `a[l]` where `l` is increased by 1.
   - If the character at index `i` of string `s` is not 'L', then `b` contains one element `a[r-1]`.

5. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, `i` will be incremented to 1 in the next iteration.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is a condition for the loop continuation, not modified within the loop body.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.
   - The content of `b` depends on the character at index `i` of string `s`. However, since the exact content of `b` is not specified in the loop head, we only need to ensure the loop can continue based on the current values of `i` and `n`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0**.
