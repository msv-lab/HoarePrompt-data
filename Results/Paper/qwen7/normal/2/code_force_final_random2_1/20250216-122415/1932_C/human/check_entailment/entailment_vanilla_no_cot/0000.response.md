Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not compute the product of the array elements modulo `m` as required. Instead, it simply appends the elements to the list `b` based on the direction ('L' or 'R') specified by the commands, without performing any modulo operation on the product of the array elements.

To fix this, you should calculate the product of the array elements modulo `m` at each step and append the result to the list `ans`. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    product_mod_m = 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            product_mod_m = (product_mod_m * a[l]) % m
            l += 1
        else:
            product_mod_m = (product_mod_m * a[r]) % m
            r -= 1
        b.append(product_mod_m)
    return b
```

With this correction, the program should work as expected according to the problem statement.
