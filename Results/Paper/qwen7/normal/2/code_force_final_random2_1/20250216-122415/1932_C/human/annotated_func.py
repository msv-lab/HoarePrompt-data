#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, a is a list of n positive integers, and s is a string of length n consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'.
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
        
    #State: `i` is `n-1`, `b` is a list of length `n`, and it contains elements from `a` based on the instructions in `s`.
    ans = []
    p = 1

    #State: Output State: `b` is a list of length `n` with at least one element remaining, `v` is the first element of the list `b`, `p` is the product of all elements in the list `b`, and `ans` is a list containing the product of all elements in `b` in reverse order.
    #
    #In this final state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `b` will have at most one element left (since each element is processed once), `v` will be the first (and possibly last) remaining element of `b`, `p` will be the product of all elements in the original list `b`, and `ans` will be a list containing each element of `b` multiplied by all the elements that came after it in the original list, in reverse order.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns a list containing the product of each element in the original list `b` with all the elements that came after it in reverse order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of `n` positive integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'L' and 'R'). It constructs a new list `b` by appending elements from `a` based on the instructions in `s`. Then, it calculates the product of all elements in `b` and stores these products in reverse order in a new list `ans`. Finally, it returns the list `ans` containing the product of each element in `b` with all the elements that came after it in reverse order.
