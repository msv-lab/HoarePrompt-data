### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program based on the provided problem description, the function summary, and the original assessment.

#### Problem Description Recap
- We need to process a series of commands ('L' or 'R') on an array `a` of length `n` and a modulus `m`.
- For each command:
  - Output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array `a` when divided by `m`.
  - Remove the leftmost element if the command is 'L'.
  - Remove the rightmost element if the command is 'R'.

#### Function Summary Recap
- The function `func_1` is supposed to:
  - Process the commands by removing elements from the array `a` as specified.
  - Calculate the product of the remaining elements in the array `a` and take the modulo at each step.

#### Original Program Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: Correctly reads the number of test cases, `n`, `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s`.
2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to track the leftmost and rightmost elements of the array `a`.
   - Iterates through the string `s` and processes each command:
     - If the command is 'L', it appends the leftmost element (`a[l]`) to the list `b` and increments `l`.
     - If the command is 'R', it appends the rightmost element (`a[r]`) to the list `b` and decrements `r`.
   - After processing all commands, it calculates the product of the elements in `b` in reverse order and appends these products to the list `ans`.
   - Returns the list `ans` in reverse order using `reversed(ans)`.

#### Issues Identified
1. **Incorrect Command Processing**:
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly process the commands. Instead of removing elements from the array `a` as specified, it simply appends the leftmost or rightmost element to the list `b`. This means the array `a` is not being modified during the command processing.

2. **Product Calculation**:
   - The product calculation should be performed on the actual array `a` as it changes with each command. However, the current implementation calculates the product on the list `b`, which is not updated correctly.

3. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The modulo operation is missing in the product calculation. The problem requires taking the remainder of the product when divided by `m` at each step.

#### Correct Implementation
To fix these issues, the function `func_1` should:
1. Process the commands by removing elements from the array `a` as specified.
2. Calculate the product of the remaining elements in the array `a` and take the modulo at each step.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    ans = []
    for i in range(n):
        product = 1
        for j in range(len(a)):
            product = (product * a[j]) % m
        if s[i] == 'L':
            a.pop(0)
        else:
            a.pop()
        ans.append(product)
    return ans
```

### Conclusion
Given the issues identified in the original program, the original program is incorrect. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
