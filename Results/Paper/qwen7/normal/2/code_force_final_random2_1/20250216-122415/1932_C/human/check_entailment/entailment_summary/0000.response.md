Reasoning:
1. The program should process each command in the string `s` and output the remainder of the product of the current state of the array `a` when divided by `m`.
2. The program constructs a list `b` by appending elements from `a` based on the instructions in `s`. However, the logic for constructing `b` is incorrect. It should append the elements from `a` in the order specified by `s`, but instead, it appends elements from the ends of `a` based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'.
3. After constructing `b`, the program calculates the product of all elements in `b` and stores these products in reverse order in a new list `ans`. This part of the logic is also incorrect because it should calculate the product of the remaining elements in `a` after each command, not the elements in `b`.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
