Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is 'L', `b` is a list with one element `a[l]`, `l` is increased by 1.**

The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Since `l` was not initialized before, its new value is 1 (assuming it was 0 before the increment). All other variables remain unchanged.
