Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `b` is a list with one element from `a[l]` appended.**

Explanation: The code snippet `b.append(a[l])` appends an element from `a[l]` to the list `b`. However, since the initial state does not provide the value of `a` or `l`, we cannot specify the exact value of the element being appended. Therefore, we only state that `b` now contains one additional element from `a[l]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
