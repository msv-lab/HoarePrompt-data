Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by the array `a` and the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is supposed to handle the logic of processing the commands.
   - It initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to track the leftmost and rightmost elements of the array `a`.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and processes each command:
     - If the command is 'L', it appends the leftmost element (`a[l]`) to the list `b` and increments `l`.
     - If the command is 'R', it appends the rightmost element (`a[r]`) to the list `b` and decrements `r`.
   - After processing all commands, it calculates the product of the elements in `b` in reverse order and appends these products to the list `ans`.

3. **Product Calculation**:
   - The product is calculated in reverse order, which means the last element processed will be the first in the list `ans`.
   - The product is taken modulo `m` at each step, but this is not explicitly shown in the code. The code only appends the product without taking the modulo.

4. **Reversing the List**:
   - The final list `ans` is returned in reverse order using `reversed(ans)`.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Command Processing**:
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly process the commands. Instead of removing elements from the array `a` as specified, it simply appends the leftmost or rightmost element to the list `b`. This means the array `a` is not being modified during the command processing.

2. **Product Calculation**:
   - The product calculation should be performed on the actual array `a` as it changes with each command. However, the current implementation calculates the product on the list `b`, which is not updated correctly.

3. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The modulo operation is missing in the product calculation. The problem requires taking the remainder of the product when divided by `m` at each step.

### Correct Implementation

To fix these issues, the function `func_1` should:
1. Process the commands by removing elements from the array `a` as specified.
2. Calculate the product of the remaining elements in the array `a` and take the modulo at each step.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    ans = []
    for i in range(n):
        product = 1
        for j in range(i + 1):
            product = (product * a[j]) % m
        if s[i] == 'L':
            a.pop(0)
        else:
            a.pop()
        ans.append(product)
    return ans
```

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the original program is incorrect. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
