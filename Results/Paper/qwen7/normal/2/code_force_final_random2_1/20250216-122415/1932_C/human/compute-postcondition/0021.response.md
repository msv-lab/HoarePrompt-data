Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `b` is a list with one element from `a[l]` appended, and `l` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `l` being increased by 1, while `i`, `n`, and the state of `b` remain as per the initial state.
