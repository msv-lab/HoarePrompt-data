Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program only removes occurrences of "map" and "pie" but does not account for overlapping instances. For example, in the string "mapmap", the program would only remove one instance of "map" and one instance of "pie", resulting in "map", which is still not a beautiful string. The correct approach would be to remove all overlapping instances of "map" and "pie" to ensure the string becomes beautiful with the minimum deletions.

To fix this, the program needs to handle overlapping substrings properly. Here's a corrected version:

```python
def func_1(s):
    if 'map' in s or 'pie' in s:
        # Remove all occurrences of 'map' and 'pie'
        s = s.replace('map', '', s.count('map'))
        s = s.replace('pie', '', s.count('pie'))
        return len(s)
    return 0

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
```

This version ensures that all occurrences of "map" and "pie" are removed, even if they overlap, thus making the string beautiful with the minimum number of deletions.
