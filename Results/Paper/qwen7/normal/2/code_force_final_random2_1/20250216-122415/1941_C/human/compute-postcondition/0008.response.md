Output State: **`ans` is 1, `s` is the substring from the start of `s` up to the character right before 'm', followed by the substring from the character right after 'p' to the end of `s`.**

Explanation: The code replaces the substring 'map' in `s` with the substring from the start of `s` up to the character just before 'm', concatenated with the substring from the character just after 'p' to the end of `s`. Since `s` must contain the substring 'map', the new value of `s` will exclude 'map'. The variable `ans` remains unchanged.
