Output State: **`ans` is 4; `s` contains the substring 'pi'**

Explanation: The code replaces the substring 'pie' in `s` with the substring before 'pie' concatenated with the substring after 'pie'. Since `s` originally contained the substring 'pie', after the operation, 'pie' is removed from `s`. The first part of the operation is `s[:s.find('pie')]`, which gets the substring from the start of `s` up to (but not including) the first occurrence of 'pie'. The second part is `s[s.find('pie') + 2:]`, which gets the substring starting right after the first occurrence of 'pie' and going to the end. Combining these two parts removes 'pie' from `s`. Given the initial state, `ans` remains unchanged, and `s` now contains 'pi'.
