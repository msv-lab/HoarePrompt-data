Reasoning:
- The provided program attempts to solve the problem by identifying and removing all occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" from the input string `s`.
- The function `func_1` correctly handles the special case where the string is exactly "mapie" and returns 1.
- However, the logic for removing "map" and "pie" substrings is flawed. Specifically, the program uses a while loop that continues to find and remove the first occurrence of "map" or "pie" until no more occurrences are found. This approach is incorrect because it does not guarantee the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.
- For instance, consider the string "mappie". The current implementation would remove "map" first, resulting in "pie", and then remove "pie", resulting in an empty string with 2 deletions. However, the optimal solution would be to remove only one character (either 'm' or 'p' in "mappie") to make the string "pie" and thus beautiful, requiring only 1 deletion.
- Additionally, the execution summary indicates that the function returns either 1 or 6, which is inconsistent with the expected behavior. The function should return the actual minimum number of deletions, not a fixed value.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
