Output State: `ans` is 3, `s` is the substring 'ma'.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `ans` will have the value 3 because the loop increments `ans` each time it finds and removes the substring 'map'. The final state of `s` will be 'ma' because the loop continues to remove 'map' until it can no longer find it, which leaves only 'ma' in the string.
