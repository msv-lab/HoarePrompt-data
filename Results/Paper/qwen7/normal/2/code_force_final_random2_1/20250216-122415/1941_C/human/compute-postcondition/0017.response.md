Output State: **`ans` is 4, `s` does not contain the substring 'pie' at least once**

Explanation: The variable `ans` was initially set to 3. The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1, making `ans` equal to 4. The condition about `s` not containing the substring 'pie' at least once remains unchanged.
