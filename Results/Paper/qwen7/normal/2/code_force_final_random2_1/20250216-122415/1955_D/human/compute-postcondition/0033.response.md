Output State: **`pairs_in_D` is increased by 1, `C[in_aa]` is currently greater than 0, `D[out_aa]` is -1, `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, `D[out_aa]` is equal to -1, `C[out_aa]` is now equal to -2.**

Explanation: The line `pairs_in_D += 1` increments the value of `pairs_in_D` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated state includes `pairs_in_D` being increased by 1, while keeping the other conditions and values of the variables as they were initially.
