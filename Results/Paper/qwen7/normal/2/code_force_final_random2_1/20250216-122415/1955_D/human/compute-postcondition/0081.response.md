Output State: **`D` is a Counter object counting the elements common to both `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object counting the first `m` elements of `aa`, `E` is a Counter object representing the elements in `cnt_aa` but not in `D`, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input, `aa` is a list of strings containing the split input from the user, `bb` is a list of strings created from the split input, `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`.**

Explanation: The line `E = cnt_aa - D` subtracts the elements in `D` from `cnt_aa`, resulting in a new Counter object `E` that contains only the elements present in `cnt_aa` but not in `D`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
