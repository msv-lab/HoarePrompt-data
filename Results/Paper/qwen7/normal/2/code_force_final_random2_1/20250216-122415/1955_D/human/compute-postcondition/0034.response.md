Output State: **`pairs_in_D` is increased by 1, `C[in_aa]` is currently greater than -1, `D[out_aa]` is -1, `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, `C[out_aa]` is now equal to -2.**

Explanation: The code `C[in_aa] -= 1` decrements the value of `C[in_aa]` by 1. Given that `C[in_aa]` was originally greater than 0, after decrementing by 1, it will still be greater than -1 (since it cannot go below 0 and then below -1). All other variables remain unchanged.
