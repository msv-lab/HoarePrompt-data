Postcondition: `aa[m:]` must have at least one element, `aa[:n - m]` must have at least one element, and the value of `D[out_aa]` is reduced by either 1 or 2. Specifically, if `E[out_aa]` was greater than 0, then `E[out_aa]` is now `E[out_aa] - 1`. Otherwise, `D[out_aa]` is now `D[out_aa] - 2`, and `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0. Additionally, `C[out_aa]` is set to 1.
