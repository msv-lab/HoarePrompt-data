Output State: **`aa` is a list of strings with at least `n` elements, `m` is an integer such that `0 <= m < n`, `n - m` is an integer such that `0 <= n - m < n`, `in_aa` is the first element from the slice `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the first element from the slice `aa[:n - m]`, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `D[out_aa] -= 1` decrements the value of `D[out_aa]` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
