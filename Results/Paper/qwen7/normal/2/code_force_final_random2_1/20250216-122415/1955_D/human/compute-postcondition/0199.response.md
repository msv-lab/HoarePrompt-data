Output State: **`fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `D[out_aa]` is reduced by either 1 or 2; `C[out_aa]` is set to 1; `in_aa` becomes the next element in `aa[m:]`; `out_aa` becomes the next element in `aa[:n - m]; E[out_aa] is decreased by 1`.**

This means that after executing the line `E[out_aa] -= 1`, the value of `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. All other variables retain their previous states as described in the initial state.
