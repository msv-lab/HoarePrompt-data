Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input**.

Explanation: The code splits the input into three integers and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. Since the input is split into three integers, each variable (`n`, `m`, `k`) is now holding one of those integers. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged.
