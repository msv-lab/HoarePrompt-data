Output State: **`pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in the Counter object D, `aa` is a list of strings from the input split by spaces, `n` is an integer input, `m` is an integer input, `k` is an integer input, `fnd` is 0, `nabors` is decremented by 1, `bb` is a list of strings from the new input split by spaces, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object containing the count of each string in `aa[:m]`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object containing the count of each string in `bb`.**

Explanation: The line `pairs_in_D = sum(D.values())` calculates the sum of the values in the Counter object `D` and assigns it to `pairs_in_D`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
