Output State: **`fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `D[out_aa]` is reduced by 1; `C[out_aa]` is set to 1; `in_aa` becomes the next element in `aa[m:]`; `out_aa` becomes the next element in `aa[:n - m]`.**

Explanation: The code `D[out_aa] -= 1` decrements the value of `D[out_aa]` by 1. The other variables (`fnd`, `C[out_aa]`, `in_aa`, and `out_aa`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
