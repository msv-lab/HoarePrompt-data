Output State: **`D[out_aa]` is decreased by 2, `fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D - 1` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `pairs_in_D -= 1` decreases the value of `pairs_in_D` by 1. The initial state was that `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 and `fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged. After executing the code, `D[out_aa]` is now decreased by 2 because it was already decreased by 1 initially and is decreased by another 1 from the current code. The condition for `fnd` remains the same, so it will be increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D - 1` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise it remains unchanged.
