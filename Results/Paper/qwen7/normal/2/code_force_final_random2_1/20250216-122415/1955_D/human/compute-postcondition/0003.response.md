Output State: **`nabors` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `aa` is a list of strings where each element is a string representation of an integer from the input.**

Explanation: The code `aa = [str(i) for i in input().split()]` takes a single line of input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to a string. These strings are then stored in the list `aa`. The values of `nabors`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
