Output State: **`E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `fnd` is adjusted according to the condition, `pairs_in_D` is adjusted accordingly, `C[in_aa]`, `D[out_aa]`, `D[in_aa]`, `C[out_aa]`, and `E[in_aa]` may be updated according to the condition, `in_aa` will be the next element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` will be the corresponding element in `aa[:n - m]`.**

This means that the value of `E[out_aa]` has been decreased by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions. The relationships between `in_aa` and `out_aa` as described in the initial state also remain valid.
