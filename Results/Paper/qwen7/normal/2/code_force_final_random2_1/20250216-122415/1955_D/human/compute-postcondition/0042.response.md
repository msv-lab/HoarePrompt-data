Output State: **`E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `pairs_in_D` is either increased by 1 or decreased by 1 depending on the condition; `C[in_aa]`, `D[out_aa]`, `D[in_aa]`, `C[out_aa]`, and `E[in_aa]` may be updated according to the condition; `aa` must have at least `n` elements; `m` must be less than `n`; `n - m` must be greater than 0; `in_aa` will take the next element from `aa[m:]`; `out_aa` will take the next element from `aa[:n - m]`.**

This means that `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, while the conditions and states related to `fnd`, `pairs_in_D`, `C[in_aa]`, `D[out_aa]`, `D[in_aa]`, `C[out_aa]`, `E[in_aa]`, `aa`, `m`, and `n - m` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
