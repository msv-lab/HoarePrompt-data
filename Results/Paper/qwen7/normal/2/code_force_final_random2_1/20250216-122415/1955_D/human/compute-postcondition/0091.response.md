Output State: **`pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1, `aa` is a list of strings with at least `n` elements, `m` is an integer such that `0 <= m < n`, `n - m` is an integer such that `0 <= n - m < n`, `in_aa` is the first element from the slice `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the first element from the slice `aa[:n - m]`**.

Explanation: The code `pairs_in_D -= 1` decreases the value of `pairs_in_D` by 1. The other variables (`aa`, `m`, `n - m`, `in_aa`, `out_aa`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.
