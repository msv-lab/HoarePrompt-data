Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Type Conversion**: The code converts list elements to strings when reading input, which is unnecessary and incorrect since the problem specifies that the elements are integers. This conversion should be removed.

2. **Counter Usage**: The code uses `Counter` incorrectly. It should directly use the list of integers without converting them to strings.

3. **Logic Errors**: The logic for updating counters and checking conditions is flawed. Specifically, the way it handles adding and removing elements from counters and updating the count of matching pairs (`pairs_in_D`) is incorrect.

4. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases properly, such as when there are no matching elements initially or when the counts of elements change in a way that affects the number of matching pairs.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        aa = list(map(int, input().split()))
        bb = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt_aa = Counter(aa[:m])
        cnt_bb = Counter(bb)
        D = cnt_aa & cnt_bb
        pairs_in_D = sum(D.values())
        E = cnt_aa - D
        C = cnt_bb - D
        
        fnd = 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0
        
        for i in range(m, n):
            out_aa = aa[i - m]
            in_aa = aa[i]
            
            if D[out_aa] > 0:
                if E[out_aa] > 0:
                    E[out_aa] -= 1
                else:
                    D[out_aa] -= 1
                    pairs_in_D -= 1
                    C[out_aa] += 1
            else:
                E[out_aa] -= 1
            
            if C[in_aa] > 0:
                D[in_aa] += 1
                pairs_in_D += 1
                C[in_aa] -= 1
            else:
                E[in_aa] += 1
            
            fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0
        
        print(fnd)

func()
```

This corrected version addresses the issues mentioned and should work correctly according to the problem statement.
