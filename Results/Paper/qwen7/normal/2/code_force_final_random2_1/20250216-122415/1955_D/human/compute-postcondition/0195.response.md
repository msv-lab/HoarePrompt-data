Output State: **`pairs_in_D` is reduced by 1; `fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `D[out_aa]` is reduced by 1; `C[out_aa]` is set to 1; `in_aa` becomes the next element in `aa[m:]`; `out_aa` becomes the next element in `aa[:n - m]`.**

Explanation: The code `pairs_in_D -= 1` decreases the value of `pairs_in_D` by 1. The other variables (`fnd`, `D[out_aa]`, `C[out_aa]`, `in_aa`, and `out_aa`) remain unchanged from their initial states as specified in the initial conditions.
