Output State: **`E` is a Counter object containing the counts of the elements that are present in `cnt_aa` but not in `D`; `D` remains unchanged; `cnt_aa` remains unchanged; `nabors`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `aa`, `bb`, `cnt_bb`, and `pairs_in_D` remain unchanged; `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k` else `fnd` is 0.**

This means that the variable `fnd` is set to 1 if the number of pairs in `D` (`pairs_in_D`) is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` is set to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
