Output State: **`fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; all other variables retain their original values.**

This means that `fnd` is incremented by 1 only if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`. All other variables (`aa`, `m`, `n`, `in_aa`, `out_aa`, `C`, `D`, `pairs_in_D`, and `E`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
