Output State: **`max_profit` is the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is (low + high) // 2, `profit_mid` is the profit calculated using `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `profit_mid` by calling the function `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`. The other variables (`max_profit`, `low`, `high`, and `mid`) remain unchanged from their previous states. The precondition that `low` must be less than or equal to `high` is still valid, and `mid` is still updated to `(low + high) // 2`. The value of `profit_mid` is now the result of the function call, but its specific value is not provided since the function `func_1` is not defined.
