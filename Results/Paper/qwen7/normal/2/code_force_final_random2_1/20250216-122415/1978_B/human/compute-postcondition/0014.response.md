Output State: **`max_profit` is the maximum of 0 and the profit calculated from the binary search process, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is (low + high) // 2.**

Explanation: The code calculates the midpoint `mid` of the current search range defined by `low` and `high`. The values of `max_profit` and the condition that `low` must be less than or equal to `high` remain unchanged. The new value of `mid` is the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2.
