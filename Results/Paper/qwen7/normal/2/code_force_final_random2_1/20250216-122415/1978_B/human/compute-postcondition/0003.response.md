Output State: **`max_profit` is 0, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of buns, `a` is a positive integer representing the usual price of a bun, `b` is a positive integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, `low` is 0, `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`, `mid` is (low + high) // 2.**

Explanation: The code calculates the midpoint (`mid`) between `low` and `high` using integer division. Since `low` is 0 and `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`, `mid` is set to `(0 + min(n, b)) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
