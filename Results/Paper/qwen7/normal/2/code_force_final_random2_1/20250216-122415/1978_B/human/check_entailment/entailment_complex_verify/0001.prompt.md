You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

        print(func_2(n, a, b))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ min(n, b), n is an integer representing the number of buns, a is an integer representing the usual price of a bun, and b is an integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.
def func_1(k, n, a, b):
    return k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a
    #The program returns the value of \( k \times b - k \times (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) \times a \)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: `k`, `n`, `a`, and `b`. It calculates and returns the value of \( k \times b - k \times (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) \times a \).

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of buns, a is a positive integer representing the usual price of a bun, and b is a positive integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9.

    #State: Output State: The final value of `max_profit` is the highest profit obtained during any iteration of the loop. After all iterations, `low` will be exactly one more than `high`, indicating that the binary search has completed. The variable `mid` will hold the last midpoint value considered in the search, and `profit_mid` and `profit_next` will be the profits calculated for `mid` and `mid + 1` respectively in the last iteration. However, since the loop condition `low <= high` ensures that the search continues until `low` exceeds `high`, the exact values of `profit_mid` and `profit_next` in the last iteration are not specified but are used to update `max_profit`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations, `max_profit` will contain the highest profit found throughout the entire binary search process, and the search range will no longer satisfy the condition `low <= high`.
    return max_profit
    #The program returns the highest profit obtained during the binary search process.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `n` represents the number of buns, `a` represents the usual price of a bun, and `b` represents the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price. It performs a binary search to find the optimal number of buns to sell at the modified price in order to maximize profit. The function returns the highest profit obtained during this process.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the profit from selling `n` buns.
   - The first `k` buns are sold at a modified price `(b - i + 1)` coins each.
   - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a` coins each.
   - We need to find the value of `k` that maximizes the total profit.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the profit for a given `k`.
   - It computes the sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic series starting from `b` with a decrement of 1, plus the profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at price `a`.
   - The formula used is:
     \[
     \text{profit} = k \cdot b - \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \cdot a
     \]
   - This formula correctly sums up the modified prices for the first `k` buns and the usual price for the remaining buns.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function uses binary search to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to the minimum of `n` and `b`.
   - It iteratively narrows down the range of `k` using binary search.
   - For each `mid`, it calculates the profit using `func_1` and compares it with the profit for `mid + 1`.
   - It updates `max_profit` with the higher of the two profits and adjusts the search range accordingly.

4. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_2` is correct. It uses binary search to efficiently find the optimal `k`.
   - The condition `if profit_next > profit_mid:` ensures that we move towards the higher profit region.
   - The condition `else:` ensures that we move towards the lower profit region.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It uses binary search to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit, and the `func_1` function correctly calculates the profit for a given `k`.
