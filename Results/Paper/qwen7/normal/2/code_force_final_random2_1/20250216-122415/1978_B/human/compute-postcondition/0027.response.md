Output State: **`max_profit` is the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`; `low` is `mid` + 1; `high` must be greater than or equal to `low`; `mid` is (`low` + `high`) // 2; `profit_mid` is the profit calculated using `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`; `profit_next` is the profit calculated using `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`**

Explanation: The value of `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. All other variables retain their previous relationships and values. The condition that `low` must be less than or equal to `high` is still valid, and `mid` remains as (`low` + `high`) // 2. The calculation of `profit_mid` and `profit_next` using the function `func_1` also remains unchanged.
