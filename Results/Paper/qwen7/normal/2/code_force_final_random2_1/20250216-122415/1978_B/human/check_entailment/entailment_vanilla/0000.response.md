Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the profit from selling `n` buns.
   - The first `k` buns are sold at a modified price `(b - i + 1)` coins each.
   - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a` coins each.
   - We need to find the value of `k` that maximizes the total profit.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the profit for a given `k`.
   - It computes the sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic series starting from `b` with a decrement of 1, plus the profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at price `a`.
   - The formula used is:
     \[
     \text{profit} = k \cdot b - \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \cdot a
     \]
   - This formula correctly sums up the modified prices for the first `k` buns and the usual price for the remaining buns.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function uses binary search to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to the minimum of `n` and `b`.
   - It iteratively narrows down the range of `k` using binary search.
   - For each `mid`, it calculates the profit using `func_1` and compares it with the profit for `mid + 1`.
   - It updates `max_profit` with the higher of the two profits and adjusts the search range accordingly.

4. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_2` is correct. It uses binary search to efficiently find the optimal `k`.
   - The condition `if profit_next > profit_mid:` ensures that we move towards the higher profit region.
   - The condition `else:` ensures that we move towards the lower profit region.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It uses binary search to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit, and the `func_1` function correctly calculates the profit for a given `k`.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
