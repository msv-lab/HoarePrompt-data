Postcondition: **`max_profit` is the maximum of 0 and the profit calculated from the binary search process. If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, the search range is adjusted to the upper half, otherwise it is adjusted to the lower half.**

This means that after executing the if-else block, `max_profit` will be the maximum value between 0 and the best profit found during the binary search process, where the search range is dynamically adjusted based on the comparison between `profit_next` and `profit_mid`.
