Output State: **`i` is the length of `pans` + 2, `mak` is equal to `i`, `n` is an input integer and greater than 0**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of any variables. It is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that any pending output is written to the console immediately. Since no variables are assigned new values or modified, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
