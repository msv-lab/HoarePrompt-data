Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the input string, and `pans` is a list containing the elements 1 and 2.**

Explanation: The code `pans.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list `pans`. Initially, `pans` contains the element 1. After appending, `pans` will contain both 1 and 2. The values of `i`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged.
