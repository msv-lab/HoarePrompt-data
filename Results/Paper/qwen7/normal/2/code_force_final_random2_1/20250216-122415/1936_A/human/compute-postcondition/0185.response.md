Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mak` is 1
   - `num_iterations` is `prev_num_iterations - 1`
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1
   - `i` is 1
   - The input string is less than '<'

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < n`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.
   - Therefore, `i` should be set to 2.
   - `n` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

5. **Consider other variables**:
   - `mak` and `num_iterations` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.
   - The input string being less than '<' is a condition for the loop to start, but it does not change within the loop itself.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` should be 2.
- `n` remains the same (greater than or equal to 1).

Therefore, the updated state is:

**State: `mak` is 1, `num_iterations` is `prev_num_iterations - 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2**
