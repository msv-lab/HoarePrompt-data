Output State: **`mak` is 3, `mak2` is `n-1`, `num_iterations` is `prev_num_iterations - 1`, `i` is 3, `pans` is a list containing `[n-2, n-1]`**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables or their values. It only flushes the output buffer, which means it ensures that all pending buffered data is written to the standard output. Since no variables are modified or referenced within this line of code, the values of all variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
