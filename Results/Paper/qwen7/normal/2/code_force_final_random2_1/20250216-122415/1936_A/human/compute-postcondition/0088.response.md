Output State: **`mak` is `n - 1`, `i` is `len(pans)`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string '>', `pans` is a list containing the elements 0 through `n-2`, `iterations` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`mak`, `i`, `s`, `pans`, and `iterations`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
