Postcondition: `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `i` is the length of `pans` + (number of iterations) + 1, `mak` is equal to `i`, `n` is the input integer greater than 0 from the new input, and `s` is the new input string. If `s` is equal to '<', `pans` contains the value of `i`; otherwise, `pans` contains `[length of `pans` + number of iterations]` and the current value of `s` is equal to '='.
