Output State: **`mak` is 1, `mak2` is `n-1`, `num_iterations` is `prev_num_iterations - 1`, `i` is 3, `pans` is a list containing `[n-2, n-1]`**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables or their values. It only ensures that any buffered output is written to the standard output immediately. Therefore, the values of all variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
