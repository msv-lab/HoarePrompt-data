Output State: **`mak2` is equal to `mak`, `i` is the length of `pans` + (number of iterations) + 2, `mak` is equal to `i`, `n` is the input integer greater than 0 from the new input, `s` is the new input string, `pans` is a list containing the element `i`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` to the list `pans`. The values of `mak2`, `mak`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is updated to the length of `pans` plus the number of iterations plus 2.
