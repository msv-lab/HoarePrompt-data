The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of any variables. It only flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any previously printed data is actually outputted. Given that no variables are assigned new values or altered by this command, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`mak2` is `n-1`, `mak` is `n-1`, `num_iterations` is `prev_num_iterations - 1`, `i` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing `n-2`, `s` is an input string, and depending on the value of `s`, either `s` is equal to `<` and `pans` includes `n-2`, or `s` is equal to `=` and `pans` remains unchanged.**
