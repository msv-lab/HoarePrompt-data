Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `pans`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `len(pans) - 1`. This means `i` starts at 1 and goes up to `len(pans) - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mak` is `i`
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `s` is the input string '>'
   - `pans` is a list containing the elements 0 through `n-2`

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (since the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `len(pans) - 1`).
   - Therefore, `i` will become `n`.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(pans)`.
   - Since `pans` contains elements from 0 to `n-2`, `len(pans)` is `n-1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n-1`.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `mak` remains unchanged as it was set to `i` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `i` is updated to `n` (the next value after `n-1`).
   - `n` remains the same as it was not modified within the loop.
   - `s` remains the same as it was not modified within the loop.
   - `pans` remains the same as it was not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`mak` is `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the input string '>', `pans` is a list containing the elements 0 through `n-2`**
