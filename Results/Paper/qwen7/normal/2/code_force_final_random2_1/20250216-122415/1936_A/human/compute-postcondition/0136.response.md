Postcondition: `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `i` is the length of `pans` + (number of iterations) + 2, `mak` is equal to `i`, `n` is the input integer greater than 0 from the new input, `s` is the new input string, and `pans` is a list containing the element `i`. If `s` equals '=', `mak2` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `mak` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, and `pans` remains unchanged except for the addition of the element `i`. If `s` does not equal '=', `pans` contains the element `i`.
