Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n` is greater than 0 but no specific value is provided for `n`.

The code snippet is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

Here, `mak` and `mak2` are not defined in the initial state, so their values are unknown. Since the problem does not provide any additional context or formulas for `mak` and `mak2`, we can only describe them as undefined variables.

Output: **'? ?, ?, 1, ?'**
