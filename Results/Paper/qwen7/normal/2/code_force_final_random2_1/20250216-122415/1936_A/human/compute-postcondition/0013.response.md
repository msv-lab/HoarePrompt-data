Output State: **`mak` is 2, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, and the input received is less than 0**

Explanation: The line `mak = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is 2) to `mak`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 1 and the input received is less than 0 is still valid.
