Output State: **`mak2` is equal to `mak`, `i` is the length of `pans` + (number of iterations), `mak` is equal to `i`, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, and `s` is the input string '>'**.

Explanation: The line `mak2 = mak` assigns the current value of `mak` to `mak2`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged. Therefore, `mak2` is now equal to `mak`, which is equal to `i`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `s`) retain their initial states.
