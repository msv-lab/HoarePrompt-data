Output State: **`mak` is `n-2`, `mak2` is `n-1`, `num_iterations` is `prev_num_iterations - 1`, `i` is `n-2`, `pans` is a list containing either `[i]` or `[n-2, n-1]` depending on whether `s` equals `'<'` or `'='`, respectively, and `s` is an input string from the user.**

Explanation: The code `mak = i` updates the variable `mak` to be equal to the current value of `i`, which is `n-2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
