Output State: **`mak2` is equal to `mak`, `i` is the length of `pans` + (number of iterations), `mak` is equal to `i`, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, and `s` is the input string '>', `pans` is an empty list, and the length of `pans` + (number of iterations) must be less than `n`.**

Explanation: The line `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables or their values. It only ensures that any buffered data in stdout is written out immediately. Therefore, all the variables remain in their initial states.
