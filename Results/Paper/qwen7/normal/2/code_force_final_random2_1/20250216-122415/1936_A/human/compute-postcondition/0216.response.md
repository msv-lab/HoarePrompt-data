Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given `for` loop is `i`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mak2` is `n-1`
   - `mak` is `n-1`
   - `num_iterations` is `prev_num_iterations - 1`
   - `i` is `n-2`
   - `pans` is a list containing `n-2`
   - `s` is an input string
   - Depending on the value of `s`, either `s` is equal to `<` and `pans` includes `n-2`, or `s` is equal to `=` and `pans` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `n-2` and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `n-1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `i` should be `n-1` and `n` must remain the same.

5. **Other variables**:
   - `mak2` and `mak` are not directly controlled by the loop and their values do not change based on the loop itself.
   - `num_iterations` is derived from `prev_num_iterations` and does not change within the loop.
   - `pans` and `s` are not directly controlled by the loop and their values do not change based on the loop itself unless specified by the loop body, which is omitted here.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`mak2` is `n-1`, `mak` is `n-1`, `num_iterations` is `prev_num_iterations - 1`, `i` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing `n-2`, `s` is an input string, and depending on the value of `s`, either `s` is equal to `<` and `pans` includes `n-2`, or `s` is equal to `=` and `pans` remains unchanged.**
