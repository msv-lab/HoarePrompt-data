Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `mak` is `n-1`
   - `mak2` is `n-1`
   - `num_iterations` is `prev_num_iterations - 1`
   - `i` is `n-2`
   - `pans` is a list containing either `[i]` or `[n-2, n-1]` depending on whether `s` equals `'<'` or `'='`, respectively
   - `s` is an input string from the user

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

3. **Values of Variables:**
   - `mak` and `mak2` both have the value `n-1`
   - `i` has the value `n-2`
   - `mak2` also has the value `n-1`

4. **Explanation:**
   - The print statement includes four arguments: `'?'`, `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2`.
   - `'?'` is a literal string.
   - `mak` and `mak2` both have the value `n-1`.
   - `i` has the value `n-2`.
   - `mak2` again has the value `n-1`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **'? n-1 n-1 n-2 n-1'**
