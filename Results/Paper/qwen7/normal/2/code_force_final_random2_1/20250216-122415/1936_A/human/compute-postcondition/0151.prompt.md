Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `i` is the length of `pans` + (number of iterations), `mak` is equal to `i`, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, and `s` is the input string '>', `pans` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    s = str(input())
    if s == '<':
        mak = i
        pans = [i]
    elif s == '=':
        pans.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `i` is the length of `pans` + (number of iterations) + 1, `mak` is equal to `i`, `n` is the input integer greater than 0 from the new input, and `s` is the new input string. If `s` equals '<', then `pans` contains the value of `i`. Otherwise, `pans` contains `[length of `pans` + number of iterations]` and the current value of `s` is equal to '='.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `i` is the length of `pans` + (number of iterations) + 2, `mak` is equal to `i`, `n` is the input integer greater than 0 from the new input, and `s` is the new input string. If `s` equals `<`, `pans` is now a list containing the integer `i`; otherwise, `pans` is a list containing the element `i` and `s` remains unchanged or becomes the new input string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `i` is the length of `pans` + (number of iterations + 1) + 2, `mak` is equal to `i`, `n` is the input integer greater than 0 from the new input, `s` is the new input string. If `s` is equal to `<`, `pans` is now a list containing the value of `i`. Otherwise, `pans` is a list containing the element `i`, and if `s` is equal to `=`, the function continues with the updated `pans`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
