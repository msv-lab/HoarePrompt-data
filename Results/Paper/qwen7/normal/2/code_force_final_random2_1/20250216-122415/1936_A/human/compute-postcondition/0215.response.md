Postcondition: `mak2` is `n-1`, `mak` is `n-1`, `num_iterations` is `prev_num_iterations - 1`, `i` is `n-2`, `pans` is a list containing `n-2`, `s` is an input string, and depending on the value of `s`, either `s` is equal to `<` and `pans` includes `n-2`, or `s` is equal to `=` and `pans` remains unchanged.
