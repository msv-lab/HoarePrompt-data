Based on the initial state provided:

- `mak` is explicitly given as 2.
- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `n` must be greater than 2, but this variable is not used in the print statement.
- The input received is less than 0, but again, this is not relevant to the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

This will print the string `'?'` followed by the values of `mak` (which is 2), `mak` again (which is 2), `i` (which is 3), and `i` again (which is 3).

Output: **'? 2 2 3 3'**
