Output State: **`i` is the length of `pans` + 1, `mak` is equal to `i`, `n` is an input integer and greater than 0**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values or states. It simply flushes the output buffer. Therefore, the initial states of the variables remain unchanged.
