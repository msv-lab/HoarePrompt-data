State: **`mak` is 0, `num_iterations` is `prev_num_iterations - 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` must be 1** 

### Explanation:
- **`mak`**: This variable (`mak`) is not directly involved in the loop condition, so its value (0) does not need to be adjusted.
- **`num_iterations`**: This variable is derived from `prev_num_iterations - 1`, but it is not directly used in the loop condition either, so no adjustment is needed here.
- **`n`**: The loop `for i in range(1, n)` requires `n` to be at least 1 for the loop to execute. Therefore, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- **`i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 1 (as specified in the range `range(1, n)`), so `i` must be 1.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 and `i` must be 1.
