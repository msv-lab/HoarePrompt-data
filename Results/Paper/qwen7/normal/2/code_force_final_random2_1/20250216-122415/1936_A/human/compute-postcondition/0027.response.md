Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change the values of any variables. It flushes the output buffer of the standard output stream, which means any buffered data is written out immediately. However, since no variables are involved in this operation, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the initial state of `i` being 0 and `n` being greater than 0 remains the same.
