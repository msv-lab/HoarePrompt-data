Output State: **`mak` is 2, `num_iterations` is `prev_num_iterations - 1`, `i` is 3**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables or their values. It only flushes the output buffer of the standard output stream, which is an operation that does not change any variable states. Therefore, the values of `mak`, `num_iterations`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
