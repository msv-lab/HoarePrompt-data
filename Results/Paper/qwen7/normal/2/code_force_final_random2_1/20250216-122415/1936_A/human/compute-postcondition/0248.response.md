Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `pans`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `len(pans) - 1`. This means `i` starts at `1` and increments by `1` until it reaches `len(pans)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mak` is `1`
   - `mak2` is `n-1`
   - `num_iterations` is `prev_num_iterations - 1`
   - `i` is `2`
   - `pans` is a list containing `[n-2, n-1]`

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently `2`, the loop will continue as long as `i < len(pans)`.
   - `len(pans)` is `2` (since `pans` contains `[n-2, n-1]`).
   - Therefore, `i` needs to be incremented to `3` for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to `3`.
   - `pans` remains unchanged.

So, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`mak` is 1, `mak2` is `n-1`, `num_iterations` is `prev_num_iterations - 1`, `i` is 3, `pans` is a list containing `[n-2, n-1]`**
