Postcondition: `mak` is 3, `mak2` is `n-1`, `num_iterations` is `prev_num_iterations - 1`, `i` is 3, `pans` is a list containing `[n-2, n-1]`. If the input string is `'>',` the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change regardless of the if condition.
