Output State: **`mak` is 1, `num_iterations` is `prev_num_iterations - 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `mak = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is 1) to the variable `mak`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `mak` is updated to 1, while `num_iterations`, `n`, and `i` retain their original values.
