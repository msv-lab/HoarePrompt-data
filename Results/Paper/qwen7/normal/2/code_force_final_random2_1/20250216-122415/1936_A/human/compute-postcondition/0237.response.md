Postcondition: `mak` is `n-1`, `mak2` is `n-1`, `num_iterations` is `prev_num_iterations - 1`, `i` is `n-2`, `pans` is a list containing `[i, n-2]`, and `s` is an input string from the user.

This means that regardless of whether `s` is `'<'` or `'='`, after executing the if-else block, the variables `mak`, `mak2`, `num_iterations`, `i`, and `s` retain their initial states as described in the precondition, and `pans` is always a list containing `[i, n-2]`.
