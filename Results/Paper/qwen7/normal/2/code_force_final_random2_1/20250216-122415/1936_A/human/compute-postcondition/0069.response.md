Postcondition: **`mak` is `i`, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the input string '>', `pans` is a list containing the elements 0 through `n-2`.** 

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition `str(input()) == '>'` is true or false, the values of `mak`, `i`, `n`, `s`, and `pans` remain unchanged from their initial states specified in the precondition.
