Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive) because `range(1, n)` generates numbers starting from `1` up to `n-1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is the length of `pans`.
   - `mak` is equal to `i`.
   - `n` is an input integer and greater than `0`.
   - If the current input is less than `0`, the function does not change any additional variables.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`, at the end of each iteration, `i` is incremented by `1`.
   - Therefore, after the previous iteration, `i` was the length of `pans`, and now it should be incremented by `1`.
   - `mak` is updated to be equal to this new value of `i`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is an input parameter and does not change within the loop.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` should be incremented by `1`.
   - `mak` should be updated to the new value of `i`.
   - `n` remains the same.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`i` is the length of `pans` + 1, `mak` is equal to `i`, `n` is an input integer and greater than 0**
