Output State: `mak` is `n - 1`, `i` is `len(pans)`, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the input string '>', `pans` is a list containing the elements 0 through `n-2`.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` until it reaches the length of `pans`. Since `pans` contains elements from 0 to `n-2`, its length is `n-1`. Therefore, `i` will become `n` after the loop finishes. `mak` will be updated to `i - 1` (which is `n - 1`) because the loop condition checks `i` up to `len(pans)` but does not include it. All other variables (`n`, `s`, and `pans`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
