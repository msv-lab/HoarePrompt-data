Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `mak` is 2
   - `num_iterations` is `prev_num_iterations - 1`
   - `i` is 2
   - The program continues execution based on the condition that the input string is equal to '<'

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.
   - The value of `mak` and `num_iterations` do not affect the loop condition directly.

5. **New State for the Next Iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will be 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`mak` is 2, `num_iterations` is `prev_num_iterations - 1`, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
