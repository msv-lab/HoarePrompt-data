Output State: **`mak` is `i + 1`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is the input string '>', `pans` is a list containing the elements 0 through `n-2`, no changes were made to the variables due to `sys.stdout.flush()`**.

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that any pending output is written to the console. However, this function does not modify any variables. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
