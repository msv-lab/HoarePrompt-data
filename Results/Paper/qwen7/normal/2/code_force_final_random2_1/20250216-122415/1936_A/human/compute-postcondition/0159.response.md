Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `len(pans)`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(pans)`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mak` is equal to the value of `i`.
   - `sys.stdout.flush()` is executed.
   - A string is read from input which is greater than the character '>'.
4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `mak` was equal to `i` at the end of the previous iteration, `i` will now be `mak + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(pans)`. Therefore, `i` should be set to `mak + 1`.
   - `len(pans)` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`mak` is equal to the value of `i` (which is now `mak + 1`), `sys.stdout.flush()` is executed, and a string is read from input which is greater than the character '>', and `len(pans)` must be greater than `mak + 1`**.

However, since we only need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, the relevant states to adjust are `i` and `len(pans)`.

Therefore, the final state is:

State: **`i` is `mak + 1`, `len(pans)` must be greater than `mak + 1`**.
