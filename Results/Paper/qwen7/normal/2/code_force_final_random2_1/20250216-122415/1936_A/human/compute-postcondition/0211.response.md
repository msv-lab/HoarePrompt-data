Output State: **`mak2` is `n-1`, `mak` is `n-1`, `num_iterations` is `prev_num_iterations - 1`, `i` is `n-2`, `pans` is a list containing `n-2`, `s` is an input string, `s` is not equal to `<`, and the current value of `s` is equal to `='.**

Explanation: The code `pans.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is `n-2`) to the list `pans`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
