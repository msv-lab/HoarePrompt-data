Output State: **`i` is the length of `pans`, `mak` is equal to `i`, `n` is an input integer and greater than 0, the current input is less than 0**

Explanation: The line `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is the length of `pans`) to the variable `mak`. The values of `n` and the current input remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment.
