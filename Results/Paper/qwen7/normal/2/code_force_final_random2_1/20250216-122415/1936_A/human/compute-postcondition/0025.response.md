Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is typically initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
   - `n` is given as a condition that must be met for the loop to execute.

3. **Understand the loop termination condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n`. Therefore, `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Consider the given information**:
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
   - `mak` and `i` are incremented during the loop.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations (which is `n-1`).
   - The stdout has been flushed each iteration.
   - `pans` is an empty list.

5. **Adjust the states for the loop to execute**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and increments, it needs to be set to 0 initially.
   - `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
