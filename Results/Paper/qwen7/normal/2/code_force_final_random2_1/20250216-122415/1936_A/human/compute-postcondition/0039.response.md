Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions at the start of the loop**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `s` is a string.
   - `pans` is a list containing 0.
   - If `s` equals '<', `mak` is 0.
   - If `s` equals '=', `pans` remains a list containing 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Update the state based on the loop condition**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and `n` is greater than 0, `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - `n` remains the same (greater than 0).

6. **Consider the other variables**:
   - `s`, `pans`, and `mak` are not part of the loop head, so their values do not change for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0**.
