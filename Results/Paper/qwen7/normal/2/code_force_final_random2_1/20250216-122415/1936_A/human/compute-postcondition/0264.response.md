Output State: **mak is 3, mak2 is n-1, pans is a list containing [n-2, n-1], num_iterations is 0, i is 3, s is the input string '=', n is the final value after all iterations, and sys.stdout.flush() is executed in each iteration.**

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, `mak` remains 3 as it was set to 3 in the last iteration. `mak2` remains `n-1` because it was set to `n-1` in the second iteration and hasn't been changed since. `pans` contains `[n-2, n-1]` as it was updated to include `n-1` in the last iteration. The number of iterations (`num_iterations`) is 0 because the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `i` is 3 as it was set to 3 in the last iteration. The variable `s` could be either '<' or '=' depending on the comparison in the last iteration, but in the final state, it is given as '='. The variable `n` takes its final value after all iterations, and `sys.stdout.flush()` is executed in each iteration to ensure the output is processed immediately.
