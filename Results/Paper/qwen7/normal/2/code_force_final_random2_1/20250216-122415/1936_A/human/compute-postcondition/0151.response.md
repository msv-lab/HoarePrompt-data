Output State: **mak2 is equal to mak, i is the length of pans + n, mak is equal to i, n is the input integer greater than 0 from the initial input, and s is the final input string. If s is equal to '<' at any iteration, pans will contain all the values of i up to that point. Otherwise, pans will contain all the values of i and the final value of s will be equal to '='.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- `mak2` will be equal to the final value of `mak`.
- `i` will be equal to the length of the list `pans` plus the number of iterations (`n`).
- `mak` will be equal to the final value of `i`.
- `n` will remain as the original input integer greater than 0.
- `s` will be the final input string received during the loop, which will be '=' if no '<' was entered, or the last entered '<' value if one was entered.
