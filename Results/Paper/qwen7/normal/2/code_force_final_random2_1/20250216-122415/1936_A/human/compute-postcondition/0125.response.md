Postcondition: `pans` now contains `[length of `pans` + number of iterations]`, `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `i` is the length of `pans` + (number of iterations) + 1, `mak` is equal to `i`, `n` is the input integer greater than 0 from the new input, and `s` is the new input string, which is equal to '='.
