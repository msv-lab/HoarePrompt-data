Output State: **`mak` is equal to `len(pans) - 1`, `num_iterations` is `prev_num_iterations - 1`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The values of `mak` and `num_iterations` are updated based on their previous states, but their specific values are not provided, so they are left in terms of their relationships to their previous values (`len(pans) - 1` and `prev_num_iterations - 1` respectively).
