Output State: `mak` is `n-1`, `mak2` is `n-1`, `num_iterations` is `prev_num_iterations - 1`, `i` is `-1`, `pans` is a list containing `[n-2, n-1]`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will decrement from `n-2` to `-1` because it starts from `n-1` and is decremented in each iteration. The variable `pans` will contain `[n-2, n-1]` because in each iteration, `n-2` is added to `pans` and `s` is either `'<'` or `'='`, but in the last iteration, `n-1` is added to `pans`. The values of `mak`, `mak2`, and `num_iterations` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
