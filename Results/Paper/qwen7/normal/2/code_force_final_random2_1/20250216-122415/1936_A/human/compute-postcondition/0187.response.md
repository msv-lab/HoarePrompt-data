Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Initial State:
   - `mak` is explicitly given as 1.
   - `num_iterations` is defined as `prev_num_iterations - 1`. Since `prev_num_iterations` is not explicitly given, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know it's one less than the previous number of iterations.
   - `n` is stated to be greater than or equal to 2, but its exact value is not specified.
   - `i` is explicitly given as 2.

2. The print statement is:
   ```
   print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
   ```

3. Substituting the known values:
   - `'?'` remains as is.
   - `mak` is 1.
   - `mak` is 1 again.
   - `i` is 2.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **'? 1 1 2 2'**
