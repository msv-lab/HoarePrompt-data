Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is the length of `pans` plus 2.
   - `mak` is equal to `i`.
   - `n` is an input integer and is greater than 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
   ```

From the initial state:
- `i` is the length of the list `pans` plus 2.
- Since `mak` is equal to `i`, `mak` is also the length of the list `pans` plus 2.
- `i` and `mak` have the same value.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
- `'?'` (a literal string)
- `mak` (which is the length of `pans` plus 2)
- `mak` (same as above)
- `i` (which is the length of `pans` plus 2)
- `i` (same as above)

So, the output will be:
Output: **'? [length of pans + 2] [length of pans + 2] [length of pans + 2] [length of pans + 2]**
