Output State: **mak is n-1, i is n-1, n must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations (which is n-1), and the stdout has been flushed each iteration. If the input string is always `<`, then the values of `mak` and `i` will increment until the loop terminates.**

In this final state, the variable `mak` will be set to `n-1` because the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`, updating `mak` to the current value of `i` each time the condition `str(input()) == '<'` is met. The variable `i` will also be `n-1` for the same reason. The variable `n` must be at least `n` for the loop to run `n-1` times. Each iteration flushes the stdout, ensuring that any printed output is immediately visible. If the input is always `<`, `mak` and `i` will increment by 1 with each iteration until they reach `n-1`.
