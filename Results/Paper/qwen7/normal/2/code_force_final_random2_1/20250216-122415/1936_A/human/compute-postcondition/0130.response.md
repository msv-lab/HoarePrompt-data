Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
   - `i` is the length of `pans` plus the number of iterations plus 2.
   - `mak` is equal to `i`.
   - `n` is the input integer greater than 0.
   - `s` is the new input string.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `mak2 = mak`.
- `i = len(pans) + \text{number of iterations} + 2`.
- `mak = i`.

So, substituting these into the print statement:
- `mak` is the value of `i`.
- `mak2` is also the value of `i` because `mak2 = mak`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
- `'?'` (a literal string).
- `mak` (which is `i`).
- `mak2` (which is also `i`).
- `i` (which is `len(pans) + \text{number of iterations} + 2`).

Putting it all together, the output will be:
Output: **'? [i] [i] [i]' (where i is the length of pans plus the number of iterations plus 2)**
