Postcondition: `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `i` is the length of `pans` + (number of iterations + 1) + 2, `mak` is equal to `i`, `n` is the input integer greater than 0 from the new input, `s` is the new input string. If `s` is equal to `<`, `pans` is a list containing the value of `i`. Otherwise, `pans` is a list containing the element `i` and `s` is equal to `=`.
