Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables and conditions:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop runs from `2` to `n-1` (inclusive).
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `2`, and `n` must be greater than `1`.

2. **Determine the next value of `i`:**
   - Since the loop starts from `2` and increments `i` by `1` each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `3`.

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Given that `i` is now `3`, the condition `i < n` will hold true as long as `n > 3`.

4. **Adjust the state based on the loop head:**
   - The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
   - `i` is updated to `3`.
   - `n` must still be greater than `3`.

5. **Consider the postcondition for `dp[2]`:**
   - The postcondition for `dp[2]` does not change because it is related to the previous iteration's state and not directly affected by the loop increment.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
