Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, followed by t sets of data. Each set consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of signs, and n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs. For each set, the function determines and returns the least common multiple (LCM) of the given periodicities a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.**

Note: Since the specific return value (LCM) is not explicitly stated in the problem description, the functionality focuses on the process described.
