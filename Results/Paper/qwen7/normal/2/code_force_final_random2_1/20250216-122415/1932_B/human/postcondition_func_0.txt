The function accepts a string `path` consisting of '@' and '*' characters, where '@' represents a valid sign and '*' represents an invalid sign. It initializes a list `dp` of the same length as `path` to zero. Depending on the first character of `path`, it sets the first element of `dp` to 1 or -infinity. For each subsequent character in `path`, it updates `dp` based on whether the character is '@' or '*'. After processing all characters, it returns the maximum value in `dp` that is greater than -infinity, or 0 if no such value exists.
