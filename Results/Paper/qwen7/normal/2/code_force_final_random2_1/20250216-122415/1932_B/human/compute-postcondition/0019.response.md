Output State: **`results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(path)`, `t` is the integer value from the first line of the `data` list minus 2, `data` remains a list of strings containing `t` space-separated lines, `index` is 7, `path` is the string from the 6th line of the `data` list, `n` is the integer value from the second line of the `data` list converted to an integer, and `results` has been appended with the return value of `func_1(path)`**.

This means that the variable `index` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 6 to 7. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
