### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Mismatch**: The provided program does not match the problem description at all. The problem description talks about the Chaya tribe and the periodic occurrences of signs leading to an apocalypse. However, the code provided deals with a different problem involving paths and dynamic programming.

2. **Function Definitions**:
   - `func_1` is defined to handle a path with characters `@` and `*`, where `@` might indicate a valid path segment and `*` indicates an invalid one. It calculates the maximum valid path length using dynamic programming.
   - `func_2` reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case. It then prints the results.

3. **Expected Solution**:
   - The expected solution should calculate the year when the nth sign occurs based on the periodicity of each sign.
   - The logic involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities, as this will be the year when all signs occur sequentially.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the provided functions do not solve the problem described, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not address the problem of determining the year when the nth sign occurs based on the periodicities of each sign. Instead, it deals with a completely unrelated problem involving paths and dynamic programming.
