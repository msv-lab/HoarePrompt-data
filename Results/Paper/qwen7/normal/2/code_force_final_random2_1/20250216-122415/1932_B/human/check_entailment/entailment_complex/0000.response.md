Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the year when all \( n \) signs of the apocalypse will occur sequentially. This involves computing the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities of the signs.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function is intended to find the LCM of a sequence of numbers represented by a string of `@` and `*` characters. However, the provided implementation does not correctly compute the LCM. Instead, it seems to be attempting to find the longest sequence of valid signs (`@`) using dynamic programming. This approach is not suitable for solving the LCM problem as described.
   
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function reads the input and calls `func_1` for each test case. However, since `func_1` is not correctly implemented to solve the LCM problem, `func_2` will also produce incorrect results.

3. **Correct Implementation**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to compute the LCM of the periodicities of the signs. The LCM of a set of numbers can be computed iteratively using the formula:
     \[
     \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{|a \times b|}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}
     \]
     where GCD is the greatest common divisor.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since both `func_1` and `func_2` do not correctly implement the solution to find the LCM of the periodicities, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
