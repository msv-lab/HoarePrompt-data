Output State: `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(path)` for each iteration, `t` is the integer value from the first line of the `data` list minus the total number of iterations (which is `t`), `data` remains a list of strings containing `t` space-separated lines, `index` is `2 * t + 2`, `n` is the integer value from the second line of the `data` list, and `path` is the string from the `(2 * t + 2)`-th line of the `data` list.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `results` will contain the return values of `func_1(path)` for each of the `t` iterations. The variable `t` will be reduced to 0 because it decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The `index` will be set to `2 * t + 2`, which is `2 * 0 + 2 = 2` more than the last line accessed during the loop (since `index` increments by 2 in each iteration). The `n` and `path` variables will hold the values from the second and the `(2 * t + 2)`-th lines of the `data` list, respectively.
