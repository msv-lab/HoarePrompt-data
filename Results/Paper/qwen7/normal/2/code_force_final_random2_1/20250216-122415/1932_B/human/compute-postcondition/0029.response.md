Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for result in results:`. The variables involved in this loop head are `result` and `results`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `results` is a non-empty list.
   - `result` holds the current element being processed.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one more element in the `results` list. This means that after processing the current `result`, there should still be elements left in the `results` list.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `result` holds the current element being processed, after processing it, the next element from the `results` list will be assigned to `result`.
   - For the loop to continue, `results` must still contain at least one element.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `results` still contains at least one element, and `result` will hold the next element from the list.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`results` is a non-empty list, and `result` holds the next element from the list**.
