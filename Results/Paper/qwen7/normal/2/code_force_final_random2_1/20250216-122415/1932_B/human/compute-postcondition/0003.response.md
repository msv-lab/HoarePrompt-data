Output State: **`t` is the integer value from the first line of the `data` list, `data` remains a list of strings containing `t` space-separated lines, each line consisting of `n` space-separated integers, and `index` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `index = 1` simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `index`. This does not affect the values of `t` or the contents of the `data` list. Therefore, the initial state of these variables remains unchanged, and only `index` is updated to 1.
