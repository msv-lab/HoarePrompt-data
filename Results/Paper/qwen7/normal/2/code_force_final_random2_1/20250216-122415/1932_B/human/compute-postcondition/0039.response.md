Output State: **`i` is 3, `dp[3]` is `max(dp[2], dp[1]) + 1`**

Explanation: The initial state is that `i` is 3 and `n` must be greater than 3. The code updates `dp[i]` to be the maximum of `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]` plus 1 if `path[i]` is '@'. Since `i` is 3, `dp[3]` is calculated as `max(dp[2], dp[1]) + 1`. The value of `n` remains unaffected as it was only mentioned to be greater than 3, not assigned a specific value.
