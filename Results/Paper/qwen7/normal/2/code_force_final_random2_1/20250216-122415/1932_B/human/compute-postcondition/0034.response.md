Output State: **`i` is 2; `dp[2]` is `max(dp[1], dp[0]) + 1` because `path[2]` is not '*', `n` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the `dp` array such that `dp[i]` is the maximum of `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]` plus 1 if the character at index `i` in `path` is '@'. Given the initial state where `i` is 2, `dp[i]` is calculated as `max(dp[1], dp[0]) + 1` since `path[2]` is not '*', and `n` must be greater than 1 as per the precondition.
