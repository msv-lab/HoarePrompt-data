Output State: **`results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(path)` appended to its previous elements, `t` is the integer value from the first line of the `data` list minus 2, `data` remains a list of strings containing `t` space-separated lines, `index` is 8, `path` is the string from the 6th line of the `data` list, `n` is the integer value from the second line of the `data` list converted to an integer, and `path` is now assigned to the value of `data[7]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the return value of `func_1(path)` to the `results` list. The other variables (`t`, `data`, `index`, `path`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
