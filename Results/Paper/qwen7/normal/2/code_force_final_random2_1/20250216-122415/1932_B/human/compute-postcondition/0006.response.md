Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is the integer value from the first line of the `data` list, `data` remains a list of strings containing `t` space-separated lines, `index` is 2, `n` is the integer value from the second line of the `data` list.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(data[index])` takes the value from the second line of the `data` list (since `index` is 1, the next line is 2) and converts it to an integer using `int()`. The value of `index` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
