Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(path)` for all iterations.
- `t` is the integer value from the first line of the `data` list minus the total number of iterations (which is `t`).
- `data` remains a list of strings containing `t` space-separated lines.
- `index` is `2 * t + 2`.
- `n` is the integer value from the second line of the `data` list.
- `path` is the string from the `2 * t + 3`rd line of the `data` list.

### Loop Head:
The loop head is:
```python
for result in results:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `result`:**
   - The loop iterates over the elements in `results`.
   - Therefore, `result` will take each element from `results` one by one.

2. **Other Variables:**
   - `t`, `data`, `index`, and `n` are not directly used within the loop head. They are not modified or referenced within the loop itself, so their values do not need to be adjusted based on the loop head alone.

### Conclusion:
Since the loop only uses `result` from the `results` list, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the state of the `results` list. The loop will iterate as long as `results` contains elements.

### Final Answer:
State: **`results` is a non-empty list**.

This means that `results` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
