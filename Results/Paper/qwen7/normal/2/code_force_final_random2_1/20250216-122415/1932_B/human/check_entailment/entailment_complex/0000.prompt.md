Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: path is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, where '@' represents a valid sign and '*' represents an invalid sign. The length of path is at least 0 and at most 1000.
def func_1(path):
    n = len(path)
    if (n == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: `path` is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, where '@' represents a valid sign and '*' represents an invalid sign; `n` is the length of the string `path`, and `n` is not equal to 0
    dp = [0] * n
    if (path[0] == '@') :
        dp[0] = 1

        #State: Postcondition: `path` is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, where '@' represents a valid sign and '*' represents an invalid sign; `n` is the length of the string `path`, and `n` is not equal to 0; `dp` is a list of `n` zeros. If the first character of `path` is '*', the first element of `dp` is set to -inf.
    #State: Postcondition: `path` is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, where '@' represents a valid sign and '*' represents an invalid sign; `n` is the length of the string `path`, and `n` is not equal to 0; `dp` is a list of `n` zeros. If the first character of `path` is '@', the first element of `dp` is 1. If the first character of `path` is '*', the first element of `dp` is set to -inf.
    if (n > 1) :
        if (path[1] == '*') :
            dp[1] = -float('inf')
        else :
            dp[1] = dp[0] + (1 if path[1] == '@' else 0)
        #State: Postcondition: `path` is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, where the first character is either '@' or '*', and `n` is the length of the string `path`, with `n` being greater than 1; `dp` is a list of `n` elements where the first element is set to -inf if the first character of `path` is '*', otherwise it is set to 1. The second element of `dp` is `dp[0] + 1` if the first character of `path` is '@', and `dp[0] + (1 if path[1] == '@' else 0)` if the first character of `path` is '*'.
    #State: Postcondition: `path` is a string consisting of '@' and '*' characters, where the first character is either '@' or '*', and `n` is the length of the string `path`, with `n` being greater than 1; `dp` is a list of `n` elements where the first element is set to -inf if the first character of `path` is '*', otherwise it is set to 1. If the first character of `path` is '@', the second element of `dp` is `dp[0] + 1`. If the first character of `path` is '*', the second element of `dp` is `dp[0] + 1` if the second character of `path` is '@', and `dp[0] + 0` if the second character of `path` is '*'.
    for i in range(2, n):
        if path[i] == '*':
            dp[i] = -float('inf')
        else:
            dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + (1 if path[i] == '@' else 0)
        
    #State: Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n`, meaning the loop has completed all its iterations. For every index `j` from 2 to `n-1`, `dp[j]` is set as follows:
    #- If `path[j]` is '*', then `dp[j]` is `-float('inf')`.
    #- If `path[j]` is '@', then `dp[j]` is the maximum of `dp[j-1]` and `dp[j-2]` plus 1.
    #- If `path[j]` is '*', and `path[j+1]` is '@', then `dp[j]` is the maximum of `dp[j-1]` and `dp[j-2]`.
    #
    #All other variables remain in their initial or updated states according to the loop's execution.
    return max(x for x in dp if x > -float('inf'))
    #The program returns the maximum value among the elements in the dp list that are greater than negative infinity.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `path` consisting of '@' and '*' characters, where '@' represents a valid sign and '*' represents an invalid sign. It initializes a list `dp` of the same length as `path` to zero. Depending on the first character of `path`, it sets the first element of `dp` to 1 or -infinity. For each subsequent character in `path`, it updates `dp` based on whether the character is '@' or '*'. After processing all characters, it returns the maximum value in `dp` that is greater than -infinity, or 0 if no such value exists.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of signs. The following line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, representing the periodicities of the signs.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        path = data[index]
        
        index += 1
        
        results.append(func_1(path))
        
    #State: Output State: `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(path)` for all iterations, `t` is the integer value from the first line of the `data` list minus the total number of iterations (which is `t`), `data` remains a list of strings containing `t` space-separated lines, `index` is `2 * t + 2`, `n` is the integer value from the second line of the `data` list, and `path` is the string from the `2 * t + 3`rd line of the `data` list.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `results` will contain the output of `func_1(path)` for each iteration. The variable `t` will be reduced by the number of iterations, `index` will point to the position right after the last path value in the `data` list, `n` will still hold the integer from the second line, and `path` will hold the last path value from the `data` list.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `results` is a list containing the output of `func_1(path)` for all iterations, `t` is reduced to 0, `data` remains a list of strings with the length equal to the initial `t` times 2 plus the number of lines in `path`, `index` points to the position right after the last path value in the `data` list, `n` still holds the integer from the second line, and `path` holds the last path value from the `data` list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) indicating the number of test cases, followed by t sets of data. Each set includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of signs, and n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs. For each set, it calls `func_1(path)` to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the given periodicities and stores the result. After processing all test cases, it prints the LCM for each set.
