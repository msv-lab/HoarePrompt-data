Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies the iteration variable `i` and the sequence `p`. Therefore, the variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `p`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `p`**:
   - Initially, `i` is set to 'E'.
   - `p` is set to 'ABCDEF'.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - The loop `for i in p:` will iterate over each character in the string `p`.
   - For the loop to start, `i` should be the first character of `p`, and `p` should be a non-empty string.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is initially 'E', it does not match the first character of `p` ('A'), so the loop will not start as is.
   - We need to adjust `i` to be the first character of `p`, which is 'A'.
   - `p` is already set to 'ABCDEF', which is a non-empty string, so no adjustment is needed for `p`.

5. **Final state**:
   - Adjust `i` to be the first character of `p`, which is 'A'.
   - Ensure `p` is 'ABCDEF' (which it already is).

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 'A', `p` is 'ABCDEF'**
