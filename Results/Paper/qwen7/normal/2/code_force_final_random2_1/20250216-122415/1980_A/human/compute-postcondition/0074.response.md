Output State: **`i` is 'F', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `ans` is 6 * m, `hmp` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F' each mapped to m, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two inputs separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `n` and `m`. The initial values of `i`, `p`, `ans`, and `hmp` remain unchanged. The input values for `n` and `m` are not specified, so they are referred to as "an input integer".
