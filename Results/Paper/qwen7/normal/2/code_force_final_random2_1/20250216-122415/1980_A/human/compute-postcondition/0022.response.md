Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `hmp`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `hmp`. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `hmp` is not empty.

3. **Determine the final state after the loop**: 
   - `i` will be `'F'` after the loop.
   - `p` is `'ABCDEF'`.
   - `ans` will be `6 * m` if none of the characters in `p` are found in `hmp`, otherwise `ans` will be `0`.

4. **Analyze the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `hmp` must contain at least one character from the string `'ABCDEF'`. This ensures that the loop will iterate through at least one element.
   - Since `i` will be `'F'` after the loop, `hmp` must contain the character `'F'`.

5. **Adjust the initial state**:
   - We need to ensure that `hmp` contains the character `'F'` for the loop to execute.
   - The value of `p` is given as `'ABCDEF'`, but this is not directly relevant to the initial state of `hmp`.
   - The value of `ans` will depend on whether any character from `'ABCDEF'` is found in `hmp`. However, since we are focusing on the initial state before the loop, we don't need to adjust `ans` yet.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `hmp` must contain the character `'F'`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`hmp` must contain the character `'F'`**
