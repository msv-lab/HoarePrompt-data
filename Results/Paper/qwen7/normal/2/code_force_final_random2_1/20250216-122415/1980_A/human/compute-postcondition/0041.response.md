Output State: **`i` is 'E', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `ans` is 0**

The code snippet `p = 'ABCDEF'` updates the value of `p` to `'ABCDEF'`. However, since `i`, `n`, `m`, `s`, and `ans` are not affected by this assignment, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
