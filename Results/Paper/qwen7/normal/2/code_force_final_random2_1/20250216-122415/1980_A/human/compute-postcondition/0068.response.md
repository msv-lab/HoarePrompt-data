Output State: **`i` is 'F', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `ans` is 5 * `m`, and `hmp` is a dictionary with key 'F' mapped to `m`.**

Explanation: The initial state is given as `i` is 'F', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `ans` is 4 * `m` + (`m` - `hmp`['F']), and `hmp` is a dictionary with key 'F' mapped to `m`. The code snippet updates `ans` by adding `m - hmp[i]` to `ans`. Since `i` is 'F' and `hmp['F']` is `m`, the expression `m - hmp[i]` simplifies to `m - m`, which is 0. Therefore, `ans` is updated to `4 * m + 0`, which simplifies to `5 * m`. The values of `i`, `p`, and `hmp` remain unchanged.
