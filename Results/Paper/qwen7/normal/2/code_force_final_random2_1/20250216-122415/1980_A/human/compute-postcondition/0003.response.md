Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user.**

The code `s = input()` assigns the value entered by the user as a string to the variable `s`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
