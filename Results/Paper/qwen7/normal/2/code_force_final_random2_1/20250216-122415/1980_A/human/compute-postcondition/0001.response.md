State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 1000, `_` is not relevant as it is a throwaway variable**.

Explanation:
- The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable used for iterating over the range of `t`. It does not affect the loop's execution condition.
- The variable `t` determines how many times the loop will run. For the loop to execute, `t` must be an integer within the specified range (1 to 1000).

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is that `t` must be an integer between 1 and 1000.
