Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is 'B'
- `p` is 'ABCDEF'
- `ans` remains equal to `m` since the condition `i not in hmp` does not apply.

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in p:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Variable**: The loop variable `i` is taken from the string `p`.
2. **String `p`**: The string `p` is 'ABCDEF'.
3. **Condition**: The condition `i not in hmp` does not apply, meaning that the value of `i` ('B') is not checked against any dictionary `hmp`.

### Next Iteration:
- The loop will take the next character from the string `p` after 'B'. The next character is 'C'.

### Updated States:
- `i` will be updated to 'C'.
- `p` remains 'ABCDEF' because the loop is iterating over the characters in `p`.
- `ans` remains equal to `m` because the condition `i not in hmp` does not apply and no other changes are mentioned.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 'C', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `ans` remains equal to `m`**
