Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is 'F', `p` is 'ABCDEF', and `ans` is `3 * m`.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each character in the string `p` which is 'ABCDEF'. For each iteration, if the character `i` is not found in the `hmp` (which is initially empty), `ans` is incremented by `m`. This happens for the first three characters 'A', 'B', and 'C' as they are not in `hmp` initially. After these three iterations, `i` becomes 'C'. The next three characters 'D', 'E', and 'F' are also not in `hmp` because they were not added during the first three iterations. Therefore, `ans` is incremented by `m` three more times. Since the loop increments `ans` by `m` a total of six times, the final value of `ans` is `6 * m / 2 = 3 * m`. The variable `p` remains 'ABCDEF' and `i` takes on the last value from the string, which is 'F'.
Code of the loop:
for i in hmp:
    if hmp[i] < m:
        ans += m - hmp[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 'F', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `ans` is 4 * `m`, and `hmp` is an empty dictionary, if `hmp['F']` is less than `m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 'F', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `ans` is 4 * `m` + (`m` - `hmp`['F']), and `hmp` is a dictionary with key 'F' mapped to `m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 'F', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `ans` is 5 * `m`, and `hmp` is a dictionary with key 'F' mapped to `m`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
