Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and is still an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4. The variable `_` is also unchanged and is still 0.
