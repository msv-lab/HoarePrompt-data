Output State: **`lst` is [5, n - 1], `mini` is min(mini, abs(pk - 5)), `ele` is 5**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mini` by taking the minimum of its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. Since `ele` is 5, `mini` is updated to be the minimum of its current value (`mini`) and the absolute difference between `pk` and 5 (`abs(pk - 5)`). The list `lst` and the variable `ele` remain unchanged.
