Output State: **`lst` is [3, 5, n - 1], `mini` is min(mini, abs(pk - 3)), `ele` is 3**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `mini` to be the minimum value between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. Since `ele` is 3, `mini` is updated to `min(mini, abs(pk - 3))`. The values of `lst` and `ele` remain unchanged.
