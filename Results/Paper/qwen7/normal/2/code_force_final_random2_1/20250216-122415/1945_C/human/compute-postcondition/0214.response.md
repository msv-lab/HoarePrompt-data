Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head includes `ele`, which is an element from the list `lst`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `ele`**: Since `ele` is taken from the list `lst`, the initial value of `ele` can be any element present in `lst`. However, since we don't know the exact elements in `lst` before the loop starts, we need to focus on the properties of `lst` that ensure the loop can execute.

3. **Properties of `lst`**: The list `lst` contains all indices from 1 to `n` (inclusive) where the percentage of zeros up to that index is at least 50 and the percentage of ones from that index to the end is at least 50. This means that `lst` is non-empty because it contains valid indices based on the given conditions.

4. **Adjust the states**: Since the loop can only execute if `lst` is non-empty, we need to ensure that `lst` has at least one element. Additionally, the values of `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, and `one_perc` are provided but they do not directly affect whether the loop can execute; they are used within the loop body.

Given this analysis, the key adjustment needed is to ensure that `lst` is non-empty.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`lst` must have at least one element**
