Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given for loop is `for i in range(n - 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `zero` is either 2 or 1.
   - `zero_perc` is 50.
   - `one` is either 1 or 2.
   - `one_perc` is 0.
   - `lst` is a list containing 1 and 2.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`. This means the loop will run as long as `i < n - 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 3 (i.e., `i + 1`).
   - The condition `i < n - 1` must still hold true, meaning `n` must be greater than 3.

Given these points, we need to update the state such that `i` is 3 and `n` must be greater than 3. The other variables (`zero`, `zero_perc`, `one`, `one_perc`, and `lst`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `zero` is either 2 or 1, `zero_perc` is 50, `one` is either 1 or 2, `one_perc` is 0, `lst` is a list containing 1 and 2**
