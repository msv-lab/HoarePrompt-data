Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(n - 1)`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 (since `range(n - 1)` generates numbers from 0 to `n-2`).
   - The expression `range(n - 1)` means that the loop will run `n - 1` times.
3. **Adjust the states based on the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0 because `range(n - 1)` requires `n - 1` to be non-negative.

Given this analysis, we need to adjust the state of `n` to ensure the loop can execute. The other variables (`mini`, `zero`, `one`, `_`, `s`, `sl`, `z`, `lst`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` being greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
