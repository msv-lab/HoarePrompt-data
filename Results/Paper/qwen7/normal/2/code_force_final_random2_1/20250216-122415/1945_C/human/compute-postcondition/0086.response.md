Output State: **`final` is an empty list with an additional element 0 if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise `final` remains an empty list; `t` is decreased by 1; `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation:
- The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (which is an integer) to the variable `n`.
- The initial state of `final` is an empty list with an additional element 0 if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, otherwise it remains an empty list.
- The value of `t` is decreased by 1.
- The variable `n` is assigned the value of the integer input, which is unknown without further context.
