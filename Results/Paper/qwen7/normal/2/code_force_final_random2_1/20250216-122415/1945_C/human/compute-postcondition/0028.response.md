Output State: **`zero` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is '0', `one` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is not '0', `zero_perc` is calculated as math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 2)), `one_perc` is calculated as math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 2)), the current value of `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, and the current value of `one_perc` is also greater than or equal to 50; `lst` is a list containing the value `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends `i + 1` to the list `lst`. This means `lst` now contains the value `i + 1`. The conditions for `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, and `one_perc` remain unchanged because the code does not affect these variables. The only change is that `lst` now includes the new value.
