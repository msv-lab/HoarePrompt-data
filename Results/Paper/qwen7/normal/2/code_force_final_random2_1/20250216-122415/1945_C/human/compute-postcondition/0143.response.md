Output State: **`lst` is `[n - 1]`, `pk` and `mini` are defined such that the absolute difference between `pk` and the element `n - 1` in `lst` is equal to `mini`, `final` is a list that has appended `elem`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `final.append(elem)` appends the value of `elem` to the list `final`. The initial conditions for `lst`, `pk`, and `mini` remain unchanged. Therefore, `lst` remains `[n - 1]`, and `pk` and `mini` are still defined based on the condition that the absolute difference between `pk` and `n - 1` is `mini`. The list `final` now includes the appended value `elem`.
