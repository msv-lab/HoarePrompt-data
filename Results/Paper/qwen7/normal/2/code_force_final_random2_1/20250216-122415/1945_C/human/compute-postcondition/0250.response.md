Based on the initial state described, `final` is a list that remains empty because the condition `if len(final) == 0` evaluates to true, and no changes are made to `final`.

Since `final` is an empty list, attempting to access `final[0]` will result in an `IndexError` if the code were to run in a real environment. However, since the question asks for what would be printed and we are to assume the code snippet is being evaluated under the given conditions, we should consider the logical outcome within the constraints provided.

Given the precondition, `final` does not have any elements, so there is no valid element at index 0 to print.

Output: **IndexError: list index out of range**
