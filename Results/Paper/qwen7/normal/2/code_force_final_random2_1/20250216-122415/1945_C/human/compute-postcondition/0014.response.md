Output State: **`zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list containing the characters of the string `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `sl`, `lst` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `lst`. No other changes are made to the existing variables. Therefore, the values of `zero`, `one`, `_`, `n`, `s`, `sl`, and `z` remain unchanged, and a new empty list `lst` is created.
