Output State: **`lst` must not be empty, and there exists at least one `elem` in `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`; `final` contains three additional elements where one is `elem` and the other two are also elements in `lst` such that their absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `final.append(elem)` appends the element `elem` to the list `final`. According to the initial state, `final` already contains two additional elements where the absolute difference between `pk` and each of these elements is equal to `mini`. After appending `elem`, `final` now contains three such elements. The conditions for `lst` and `pk` remain unchanged.
