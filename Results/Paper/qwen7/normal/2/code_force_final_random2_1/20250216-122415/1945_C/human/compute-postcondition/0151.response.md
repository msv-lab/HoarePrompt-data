Output State: **`lst` is an empty list, `pk` and `mini` are undefined, and `final` is a list that contains the elements `n - 1` and `elem`, and `final` has appended `elem`.**

Explanation: The code `final.append(elem)` appends the value of `elem` to the list `final`. Since `final` initially contained the elements `n - 1` and `elem`, after appending `elem`, `final` now contains the elements `n - 1` and `elem` twice. However, since lists do not allow duplicate elements unless explicitly added, `final` will contain `n - 1` and `elem` once each. The other variables `lst`, `pk`, and `mini` remain unchanged.
