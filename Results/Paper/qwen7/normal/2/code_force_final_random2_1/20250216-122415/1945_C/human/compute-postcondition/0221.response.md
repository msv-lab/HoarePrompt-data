Output State: `lst` must be empty, `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its final value after the last iteration and `abs(pk - ele)` for the last element in the original `lst`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `lst` will be empty because all elements will have been processed. The variable `mini` will hold the smallest value it was updated to during any iteration of the loop, which is the minimum of its previous value and `abs(pk - ele)` for each `ele` in `lst`.
