Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `elem` and the object `lst`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `lst` is currently empty.
   - `mini` is defined based on the minimum value between its final value after the last iteration and `abs(pk - ele)` for the last element in the original `lst`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in `lst`. For the loop to execute, `lst` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `lst` is empty initially, it needs to contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The value of `mini` is dependent on the elements in `lst`, but since the loop hasn't run yet, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `mini` will be updated during the loop iterations.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `lst` to ensure the loop can execute. 

**Final Answer**:
State: **`lst` must have at least one element**
