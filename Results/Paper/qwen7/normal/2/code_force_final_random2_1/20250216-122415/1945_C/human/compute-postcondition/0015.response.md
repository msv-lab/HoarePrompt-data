Output State: **`mini` is 100000000, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list containing the characters of the string `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `sl`, `lst` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `mini = pow(10, 8)` assigns the value `100000000` (which is \(10^8\)) to the variable `mini`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
