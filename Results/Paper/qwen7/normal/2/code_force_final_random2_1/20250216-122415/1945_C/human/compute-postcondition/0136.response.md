Output State: **`lst` is `[n - 1]`, `mini` is `min(mini, abs(pk - n + 1))`, `ele` is `n - 1`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mini` by comparing its current value with `abs(pk - ele)`. Given that `ele` is `n - 1`, `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - (n - 1))`. The values of `lst` and `ele` remain unchanged.
