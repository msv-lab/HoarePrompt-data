Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(n - 1):` statement. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `zero_perc` is calculated based on the values of `zero`, `i`, and `n`.
   - `zero` is increased by 1.
   - `one` is increased by the number of non-'0' characters in `s`.
   - `one_perc` is calculated based on the values of `o`, `one`, and `n`.
   - `lst` contains the element `i + 1` if both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50, otherwise it maintains its previous value.

3. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over `range(n - 1)`, the loop will continue if `i < n - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value, say `i_end_prev`, and `n` must be greater than `i_end_prev + 1`.

Given that the loop will continue if `i < n - 1`, let's assume the loop is about to start the next iteration where `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.

4. **Update the Values:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `n` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `zero` will be increased by 1 from its previous value.
   - `one` will be increased by the number of non-'0' characters in `s` from its previous value.
   - `lst` will maintain its previous value unless the conditions for appending `i + 1` are met in this new iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes:

State: **`zero_perc` is calculated as math.ceil((zero + 1 + 1) * 100 / (i + 2 + 1)), `zero` is increased by 1, `one` is increased by the number of non-'0' characters in `s`, `one_perc` is calculated as math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - (i + 1) - 2)), and `lst` contains the element `i + 1` if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50. Otherwise, the same values are maintained as before the if-else block.**

Simplified:
State: **`zero` is increased by 1, `one` is increased by the number of non-'0' characters in `s`, `i` is increased by 1, and `n` remains the same.**

Final Answer:
State: **`zero` is increased by 1, `one` is increased by the number of non-'0' characters in `s`, `i` is increased by 1, and `n` remains the same.**
