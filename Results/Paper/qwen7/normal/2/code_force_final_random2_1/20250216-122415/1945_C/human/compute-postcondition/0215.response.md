Output State: **`lst` must have at least one element; `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`**

Explanation: The line `mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))` updates the value of `mini` to be the minimum between its current value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`. Since `ele` is an element from `lst`, the precondition that `lst` must have at least one element remains valid. The exact value of `mini` depends on the current value of `mini` and the value of `abs(pk - ele)`, but it is guaranteed to be the smaller of these two values.
