Output State: **The final state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows: `zero` is 3, `one` is the total count of '1' in the string `s`, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` remains the same, `zero_perc` is 75, `one_perc` is 0, `lst` is [3, 5, n - 1], `mini` is still 100000000, `t` is `n - 2`, and `final` is an empty list if `c1` is less than 50, otherwise it contains 0.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2`.
- During each iteration, `zero` and `one` are updated based on the characters in the string `s`.
- After the loop completes, `i` will be `n - 1`.
- `zero_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil(3 * 100 / (n - 1))`, which simplifies to 75% given that `zero` is 3.
- `one_perc` remains 0 because `one` is the count of '1's in `s` and `n - i - 1` is large enough that the percentage calculation does not reach 50%.
- `lst` accumulates the values where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` meet the condition, which are 3, 5, and potentially `n - 1` if the conditions are met.
- The other variables (`mini`, `t`, `final`, `c1`, `o`, `z`, `sl`, `s`) retain their last known values or initial conditions as no further changes are specified.
