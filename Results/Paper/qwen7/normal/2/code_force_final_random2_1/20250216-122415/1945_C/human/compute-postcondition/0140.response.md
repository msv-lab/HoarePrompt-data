Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `elem` and the object `lst`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `lst`**: The state before the loop starts is given as `lst` is `[n - 1]`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `lst`. For the loop to execute, `lst` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the state of `lst`**: Since `lst` is initially `[n - 1]`, it already contains one element. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `lst`.

5. **Consider the variable `elem`**: During the first iteration of the loop, `elem` will be set to the first (and only) element of `lst`, which is `n - 1`.

6. **Check the state of `mini`**: The state of `mini` is given as `mini` is `min(mini, abs(pk - n + 1))`. This line suggests that `mini` is being updated based on some value `pk` and the current value of `n`. However, since we are focusing on the loop head and the initial state, we don't need to adjust `mini` further.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be considered for the loop to execute is `lst`, which already meets the requirement of containing at least one element.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`lst` is `[n - 1]`**
