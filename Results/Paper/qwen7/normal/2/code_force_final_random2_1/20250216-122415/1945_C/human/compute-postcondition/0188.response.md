Output State: **`i` is 0, `zero` is 1, `zero_perc` is 100, `one` is 1, `one_perc` is 0**

Explanation: The code calculates `one_perc` using the formula `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. Given the initial state where `i` is 0, `zero` is 1 (which means `one` is 1), and `zero_perc` is 100, the calculation becomes `math.ceil((1 - 1) * 100 / (n - 0 - 1))`, which simplifies to `math.ceil(0 * 100 / (n - 1))`. Since any number multiplied by 0 is 0, the result is `math.ceil(0)`, which is 0. Therefore, `one_perc` is assigned the value 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
