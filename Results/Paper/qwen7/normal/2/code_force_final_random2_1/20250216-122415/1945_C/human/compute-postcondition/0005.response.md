Output State: **`n` is an input integer and is even, `pk` is `n // 2`, `_` is 0, `s` is an input string.**

Explanation: The code `pk = n // 2` assigns the value of `n // 2` (integer division of `n` by 2) to the variable `pk`. Since `n` is specified to be an even input integer, `pk` will be an integer resulting from the division of `n` by 2. The other variables (`_`, `s`) remain unchanged.
