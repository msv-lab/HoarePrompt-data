Output State: **`zero` is 2, `one` is increased by either the number of non-'0' characters in `s` or 2, `i` is 2, `n` remains the same, `zero_perc` is calculated as the ceiling of (`zero` * 100 / (`i` + 1)), `one_perc` is calculated as the ceiling of ((`o` - `one`) * 100 / (n - `i` - 1))**.

Explanation: 
- Initially, `zero` is increased by 1, so `zero` is 2.
- `one` is increased by either the number of non-'0' characters in `s` or 2, but since `s` is not specified, we keep it as "increased by either the number of non-'0' characters in `s` or 2".
- `i` is increased by 1, so `i` is 2.
- `n` remains the same.
- `zero_perc` is calculated as the ceiling of (`zero` * 100 / (`i` + 1)), which is `math.ceil(2 * 100 / 3)`.
- `one_perc` is calculated as the ceiling of ((`o` - `one`) * 100 / (n - `i` - 1)), where `o` is the initial value of `one`. Since `o` is not specified, we express it as (`o` - `one`) * 100 / (n - `i` - 1).
