Postcondition: **`zero` is 2, `one` is increased by either the number of non-'0' characters in `s` or 2, `i` is 3, `n` remains the same, `zero_perc` is calculated as the ceiling of (2 * 100 / (3 + 1)), `one_perc` is calculated as the ceiling of ((`o` - `one`) * 100 / (n - 3 - 1)), `lst` is [3]**.

This means that after the if-else block executes:
- `zero` remains 2.
- `one` is increased by either the number of non-'0' characters in `s` or 2.
- `i` becomes 3.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `zero_perc` is recalculated as the ceiling of (2 * 100 / 4).
- `one_perc` is recalculated as the ceiling of ((`o` - `one`) * 100 / (n - 3 - 1)).
- `lst` is set to [3].
