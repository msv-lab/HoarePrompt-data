Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `ele` and `lst`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `lst`. 

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mini` is the minimum value between `mini` and `abs(pk - ele)`.
   - `zero` is the total number of '0's in the string `s`.
   - `one` is the total number of '1's in the string `s`.
   - `_` is still 0.
   - `n` is the length of the string `s`.
   - `s` is the input string.
   - `sl` is a list containing the characters of the string `s`.
   - `z` is the number of '0's in `sl`.
   - `lst` is a list containing all indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50 during the loop execution, and `lst` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues based on the presence of elements in `lst`, we need to ensure that `lst` still contains at least one element.
   - The other variables (`mini`, `zero`, `one`, `_`, `n`, `s`, `sl`, `z`) do not change within the loop body, so they remain the same.
   - `ele` will be set to the next element in `lst`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `mini` remains the same.
- `zero` remains the same.
- `one` remains the same.
- `_` remains the same.
- `n` remains the same.
- `s` remains the same.
- `sl` remains the same.
- `z` remains the same.
- `lst` must still contain at least one element.
- `ele` will be the next element in `lst`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`mini` is the minimum value between `mini` and `abs(pk - ele)`, `zero` is the total number of '0's in the string `s`, `one` is the total number of '1's in the string `s`, `_` is still 0, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `s` is the input string, `sl` is a list containing the characters of the string `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `sl`, `lst` is a list containing all indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50 during the loop execution, and `lst` must contain at least one element, `ele` is the next element in `lst`**.
