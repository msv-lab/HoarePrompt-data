Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the percentage of residents who are satisfied on each side of the road. Specifically, the program calculates `zero_perc` and `one_perc` using the formula `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))` and `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, which is incorrect. Instead, it should check if the number of zeros on the left side is at least `math.ceil((i + 1) / 2)` and the number of ones on the right side is at least `math.ceil((n - i - 1) / 2)`.

For example, consider the input:
```
6
010111
```

The correct output should be `3`, because:
- If the road is placed after the third house, there are 2 zeros on the left (out of 3 houses), which is at least `math.ceil(3 / 2) = 2`.
- There are 4 ones on the right (out of 3 houses), which is at least `math.ceil(3 / 2) = 2`.

However, the program incorrectly calculates the percentages and may not identify this as a valid position. This discrepancy indicates that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
