The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a binary string `s` of length `n`. It calculates the percentage of '1's and '0's in the string up to every possible position and identifies positions where both percentages first reach or exceed 50%. From these positions, it selects the one closest to half the length of the string (`pk`). If no such position exists, it returns either the start or end of the string based on the overall percentage of '1's. The function outputs the selected position for each test case.
