Output State: `lst` is an empty list, `pk` and `mini` are undefined, and `final` is a list that contains the elements `n - 1` and `elem` from each iteration where `abs(pk - elem) == mini`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `lst` will be an empty list because all elements have been processed. The variables `pk` and `mini` will be undefined as they are not reassigned within the loop. The `final` list will contain all elements from the original `lst` (which initially contained `[n - 1]`) that satisfied the condition `abs(pk - elem) == mini` during each iteration.
