Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `zero` is either 3 or 2 or 1, `zero_perc` is 53, `one` is either 2 or 3 or 1, `one_perc` is 75, `lst` is a list containing 1, 2, and 4. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then the values of `zero`, `zero_perc`, `one`, `one_perc`, and `lst` remain unchanged.
