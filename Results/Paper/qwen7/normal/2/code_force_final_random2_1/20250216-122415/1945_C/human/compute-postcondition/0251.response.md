Output State: **final is a list of integers. Depending on the value of `t`, `final` will either contain the smallest index `ele` from `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele` is equal to `mini`, or it will be an empty list followed by an element 0 if `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, or it will be an empty list followed by an element `n` if `c1` is less than 50.**

In more detail:
- After all iterations of the loop, `final` will be determined based on the conditions inside the loop for each test case (`t`).
- For each test case, `final` will contain the smallest index from `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele` is equal to `mini`, unless certain conditions make `final` an empty list followed by either 0 or `n`.
- The exact contents of `final` will vary based on the input values for each test case, but it will always be a list that adheres to the described postconditions for each iteration.
