Postcondition: `lst` must not be empty, and there exists at least one `elem` in `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`; `final` contains three additional elements where one is `elem` and the other two are also elements in `lst` such that their absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`.
