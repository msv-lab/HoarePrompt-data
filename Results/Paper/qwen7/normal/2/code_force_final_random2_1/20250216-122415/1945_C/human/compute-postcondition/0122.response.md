Output State: **`zero` is 2, `one` is increased by 1 (originally increased by the number of non-'0' characters in `s` or 2), now it is `one + 1`, `i` is 4, `n` remains the same, `zero_perc` is 50, `one_perc` is calculated as the ceiling of ((`o` - (`one + 1`)) * 100 / (n - 3 - 1)), `lst` is [3]**.

Explanation: The variable `one` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `one` was increased by either the number of non-'0' characters in `s` or 2, but now it is further incremented by 1. The value of `zero` remains 2. The value of `i` remains 4. The value of `n` remains unchanged. The value of `zero_perc` is calculated as the ceiling of (2 * 100 / (3 + 1)), which is 50. The value of `one_perc` is recalculated as the ceiling of ((`o` - (`one + 1`)) * 100 / (n - 3 - 1)). The list `lst` remains [3].
