Output State: **`lst` is an empty list, `pk` and `mini` are undefined, `final` is a sorted list containing the element `n`, and the length of `final` is 1; `c1` is less than 50.**

Explanation: The code `final.append(n)` adds the value of `n` to the list `final`. Since `final` was initially an empty list, after appending `n`, `final` now contains one element, which is `n`. The other variables (`lst`, `pk`, `mini`, and `c1`) remain unchanged.
