Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `zero` is either 3 or 2 or 1, `zero_perc` is 53, `one` is either 2 or 3 or 1, `one_perc` is 75, `lst` is a list containing 1, 2, and 4.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Since `i` is 3, `i + 1` is 4. The other variables remain unchanged.
