Postcondition: **`zero_perc` is calculated as math.ceil((zero + 1) * 100 / (i + 2)), `zero` is increased by 1, `one` is increased by the number of non-'0' characters in `s`, `one_perc` is calculated as math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 2)), and `lst` contains the element `i + 1` if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50. Otherwise, the same values are maintained as before the if-else block.**
