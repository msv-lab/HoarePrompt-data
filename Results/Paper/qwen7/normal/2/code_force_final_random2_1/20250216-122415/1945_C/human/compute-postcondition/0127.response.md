Output State: **`zero` is 3; `one` is increased by either the number of non-'0' characters in `s` or 3; `i` is 5; `n` remains the same; `zero_perc` is 30; `one_perc` is 0; `lst` is [3, 5]**.

Explanation: The code `lst.append(i + 1)` appends the value of `i + 1` to the list `lst`. Given that `i` is 4, `i + 1` equals 5. Therefore, the list `lst` now contains `[3, 5]`. The values of `zero`, `one`, `n`, `zero_perc`, and `one_perc` remain unchanged.
