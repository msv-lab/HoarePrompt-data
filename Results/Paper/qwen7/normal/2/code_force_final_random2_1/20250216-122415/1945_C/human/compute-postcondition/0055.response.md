Output State: **`mini` is the minimum value between `mini` and `abs(pk - ele)`, `zero` is the total number of '0's in the string `s`, `one` is the total number of '1's in the string `s`, `_` is still 0, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `s` is the input string, `sl` is a list containing the characters of the string `s`, `z` is the number of '0's in `sl`, `lst` is a list containing all indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50 during the loop execution, and `lst` must contain at least one element, `ele` is the next element in `lst`, and `mini` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`**.

Explanation: The line `mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))` updates the value of `mini` to be the minimum of its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
