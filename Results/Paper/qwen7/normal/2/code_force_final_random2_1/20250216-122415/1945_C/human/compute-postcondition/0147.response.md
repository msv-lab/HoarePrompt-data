Output State: **`lst` is an empty list, `pk` and `mini` are undefined, and `final` is a list that contains the elements `n - 1` and `elem`.**

Explanation: The code `final.append(elem)` appends the value of `elem` to the list `final`. Since `final` initially contained the element `n - 1`, after appending `elem`, `final` now contains both `n - 1` and `elem`. The other variables (`lst`, `pk`, and `mini`) remain unchanged.
