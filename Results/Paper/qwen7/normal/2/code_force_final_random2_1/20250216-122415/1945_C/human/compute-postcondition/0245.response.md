Output State: **`final` is a list containing `n`, `c1` is `o * 100 // n` and is less than 50**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `n` to the list `final`. Since `c1` was previously defined as `o * 100 // n` and is less than 50, these conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, `final` now contains `n`, and `c1` retains its previous value which is less than 50.
