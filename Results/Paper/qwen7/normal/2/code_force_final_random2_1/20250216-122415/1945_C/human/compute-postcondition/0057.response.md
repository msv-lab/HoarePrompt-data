Output State: **`mini` is the minimum value between `mini` and `abs(pk - ele)` for all elements `ele` in `lst`; `zero` is the total number of '0's in the string `s`; `one` is the total number of '1's in the string `s`; `_` is still 0; `n` is the length of the string `s`; `s` is the input string; `sl` is a list containing the characters of the string `s`; `z` is the number of '0's in `sl`; `lst` is a list containing all indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are greater than or equal to 50 during the loop execution; `final` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `final`. This does not affect the values of the other variables, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
