Output State: **`zero_perc` is calculated as math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1)), `zero` is increased by 1, `one` is increased by the number of non-'0' characters in `s`, and `one_perc` is calculated as math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1)).**

Explanation: The code calculates `one_perc` based on the updated values of `one` and `o` (which is likely another name for `one`), and the updated value of `i`. The value of `zero` is increased by 1 for each '0' in `s`, and `one` is increased by 1 for each non-'0' character in `s`. The initial calculation of `zero_perc` remains unchanged as it was before the code execution.
