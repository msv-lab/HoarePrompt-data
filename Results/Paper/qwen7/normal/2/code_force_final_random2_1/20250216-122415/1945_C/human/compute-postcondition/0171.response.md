Output State: **`lst` is an empty list, `pk` is `n // 2`, `mini` is undefined, `final` is a sorted list containing either an element `n // 2` or the element 0, and the length of `final` is 1; `c1` is either greater than or equal to 50 or less than 50.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `n // 2` to `pk`. Since `n` is replaced by the input integer `s`, `pk` is now `s // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
