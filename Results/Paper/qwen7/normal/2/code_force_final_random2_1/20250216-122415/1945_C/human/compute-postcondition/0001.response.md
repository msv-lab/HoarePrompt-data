State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, `_` is 0**

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `_` is used as a placeholder in the `range(t)` function. It is automatically initialized to 0 when the loop starts and increments by 1 with each iteration.
- The variable `t` determines how many times the loop will run. Since the loop body is omitted, the only thing that needs adjustment is ensuring that `t` is within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4) and that `_` is set to 0 at the beginning of the loop.

Thus, the state before the loop should be adjusted to reflect these conditions.
