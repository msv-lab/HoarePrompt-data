Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for elem in lst:`. The variables involved here are `elem` and `lst`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `lst`. After each iteration, `elem` takes the next element from `lst`.

3. **Postcondition Analysis**:
   - `lst` must have at least one element.
   - `elem` is the next element in `lst`.
   - `final` now contains the element `elem`.
   - If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`, then `final` remains unchanged. Otherwise, no change occurs to `final`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `elem` is the next element in `lst`, after the current iteration, `lst` will have one less element.
   - `final` will contain the current value of `elem`.
   - `pk` and `mini` remain unchanged.

5. **New State**:
   - `lst` must have at least one element (since it had at least one before and one was just removed).
   - `elem` will be the next element in `lst`.
   - `final` will contain the current value of `elem`.

Given the above analysis, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`lst` must have at least one element, `elem` is the next element in `lst`, `final` contains the current value of `elem`**.
