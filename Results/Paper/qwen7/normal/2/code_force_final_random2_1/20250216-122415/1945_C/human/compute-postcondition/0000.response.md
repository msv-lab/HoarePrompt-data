Output State: **t is an input integer, 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and a is a string of length n consisting only of '0' and '1'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\) remains valid, and the other conditions for `n` and `a` remain unchanged.
