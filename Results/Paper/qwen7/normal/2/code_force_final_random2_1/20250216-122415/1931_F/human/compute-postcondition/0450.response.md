Output State: **`p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `n-2`, `idx1` is `n-2`, `idx2` is `n-2`, `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is the first integer from input, `l3` is a list of remaining integers from input.**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. The values of `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `a3`, and `l3` remain unchanged from their initial states.
