Output State: **`m` is 3, `val` is a list containing exactly 3 tuples, each tuple is (`a3`, `l3`), and neither of the conditions inside the loop causes a 'break', so the loop completes all 3 iterations without printing 'no'. The final state of `val` contains 3 tuples where each tuple consists of `a3` and `l3` as they were on each iteration.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, `m` remains 3 because the loop runs `m-2` times. The list `val` contains exactly 3 tuples, each representing the values of `a3` and `l3` from each iteration of the loop. Importantly, the loop does not encounter a situation where it would print 'no' and break, so it successfully appends the required tuples to `val` in each of the 3 iterations.
