Postcondition: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `m` is `m + 1`, `a1` is the first integer from input, `a2` is the second integer from input, `l2` is a list of remaining integers from input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, and the current value of `i + max(p1, p2)` is equal to `n - 1`.
