Output State: `val` will be a list containing tuples of (`a3`, `l3`) for each iteration of the loop, with `a3` being the first integer from the input split on each iteration and `l3` being the remaining integers from the input split. After all iterations, `a3` and `l3` will contain the last set of integers entered by the user, as they were split from the input on the last iteration. The loop will continue to iterate as long as `l3` is not equal to a list containing all elements of `l` except for `a3`. If `l3` ever equals such a list, the loop will break, and 'no' will be printed. If the loop completes without breaking (meaning `l3` never equals the required list), then 'yes' will be printed.

In summary, `val` will hold the history of all pairs (`a3`, `l3`) from each iteration, and the final output will be 'yes' if the condition is met for all iterations, otherwise 'no'.
