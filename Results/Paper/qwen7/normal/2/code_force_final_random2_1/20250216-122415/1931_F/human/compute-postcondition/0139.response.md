Output State: **`a3` is the first integer from the new input split, `l3` is a list containing the remaining integers from the new input split, `val` is a list containing a tuple of (`a3`, `l3`), `m - 2` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the first integer to `a3` and the rest to `l3` as a list. The original `val` list containing the tuple (`a3`, `l3`) remains unchanged. The condition `m - 2 > 1` is still valid.
