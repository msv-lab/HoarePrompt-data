Postcondition: `idx1` is either `n-2` or `-1`, `idx2` is `n-2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 1, `val` is an empty list, and `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`. Since the condition `m == 2` is checked in the if statement and no modifications are made to the variables when the condition is not met (as there is no else part), the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
