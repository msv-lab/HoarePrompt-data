### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Checks:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of participants `n` and the number of screenshots `m`.
   - If `m == 1`, it prints 'yes' and continues to the next test case. This part is correct.

2. **Initial Screenshot Comparison:**
   - The function reads the first two screenshots and compares the lists `l1` and `l2` after removing the author from each list.
   - If these lists are not equal, it prints 'no' and skips further checks. This part is correct.

3. **Index Calculation and List Insertion:**
   - The function calculates indices `idx1` and `idx2` where the author of the second screenshot appears in the first list and vice versa.
   - Based on these indices, it decides which list to modify and inserts the author at the calculated index.
   - This logic is mostly correct, but there are some issues with how the indices are handled and the conditions under which the lists are modified.

4. **Handling Multiple Screenshots:**
   - The function iterates over the remaining screenshots and checks if they match the modified list after removing the author.
   - If any screenshot does not match, it prints 'no'.
   - If all screenshots match, it prints 'yes'.

### Issues Identified:
- **Index Handling:** The logic for calculating `idx1` and `idx2` is flawed. It assumes that the indices will always be found in a straightforward manner, which may not be true.
- **List Modification:** The insertion logic is overly complex and may not handle all edge cases correctly.
- **Edge Cases:** The function does not handle all possible edge cases, such as when the lists are already sorted or when the indices are not found.

### Correctness:
Given the identified issues, the function does not handle all possible cases correctly. Therefore, the given program is **incorrect**.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
