Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The loop will execute `m - 2` times. After all iterations, `val` will be a list containing tuples of (`a3`, `l3`) for each iteration of the loop. Specifically, `val` will contain `m - 2` tuples. The value of `m` will be `n - 3` because it starts as `n - 1` minus 1 and decreases by 1 for each iteration of the loop until it reaches 2, meaning the loop runs `m - 2` times. The variables `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `n`, `val`, and `m` will retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop, with `m` being set to 2 after the loop completes.

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, `val` will hold a list of tuples, each representing the input values `a3` and the list `l3` from each iteration of the loop. The variable `m` will be reduced to 2, indicating that the loop ran `m - 2` times.
Code of the loop:
for a3, l3 in val:
    if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
        print('no')
        break
else:
    print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples, `a3` and `l3` are the values from the current tuple in `val` during each iteration. If the current value of `l3` is not equal to a list obtained by iterating over `l` and excluding all elements that are equal to `a3`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as described in the if part.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `val` contains `m - 2` tuples, `a3` and `l3` are the values from the next tuple in `val`, and either `l3` is not equal to a list comprehension excluding `a3` from `l`, in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or there is no else part and the values remain as they were checked.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `val` contains `m - 3` tuples, `a3` and `l3` are the values from the next tuple in `val`, and if `l3` is not equal to a list comprehension excluding `a3` from `l`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l3` is equal to the list comprehension, the values remain as they were checked.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
