Output State: **`val` must contain at least one tuple, `a3` is the first element of the first tuple in `val`, and `l3` is the second element of the first tuple in `val', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of `val`, `a3`, or `l3`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it was in. Therefore, these variables retain their initial values from the initial state.
