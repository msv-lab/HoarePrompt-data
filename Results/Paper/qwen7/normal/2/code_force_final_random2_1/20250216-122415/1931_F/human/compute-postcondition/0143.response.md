Output State: **`a3` is the first value from `map(int, input().split())`, `l3` is a list containing the remaining values from `map(int, input().split())`, `val` is a list containing one tuple (a3, l3), `m - 2` must now be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Here, `a3` is the first value from `map(int, input().split())`, and `l3` is a list containing the remaining values from `map(int, input().split())`. The value of `val` is updated to include this new tuple. The condition `m - 2 > 0` is mentioned as a precondition and remains valid after the code execution.
