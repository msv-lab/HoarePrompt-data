Postcondition: **`p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 2, `idx1` is either 0, 1, or 2, `idx2` is either 0, 1, or 2, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The if part sets `idx1` to 2 if `p1` is 1, and the else part sets `idx2` to 2 if `p2` is 1. Therefore, after the if-else block executes, `idx1` can be 0, 1, or 2, and `idx2` can also be 0, 1, or 2, while the other variables retain their original constraints.
