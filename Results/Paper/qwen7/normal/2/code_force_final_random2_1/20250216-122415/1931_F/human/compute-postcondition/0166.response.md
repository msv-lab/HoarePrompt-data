Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `val` is an empty list, and we wait for further input to proceed with the next steps.**

Explanation: The code `input()` simply waits for user input. It does not assign any value to existing variables or create new ones. Therefore, the only changes are that `val` becomes an empty list since no pairs (`a3`, `l3`) have been added yet, and we are now waiting for further input to proceed with the next steps.
