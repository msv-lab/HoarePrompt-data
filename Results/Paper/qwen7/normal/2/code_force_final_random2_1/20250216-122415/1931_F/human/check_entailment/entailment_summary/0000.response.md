Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to determine if there exists an order of participants such that all given screenshots could have been obtained from this order. Each screenshot shows the order of participants as seen by a specific user, with that user always appearing at the top.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where only one screenshot is provided (`m == 1`), printing 'yes' because any order is valid.
   - For more than one screenshot, the function checks if the remaining elements in both screenshots match after removing the user who took the screenshot. If they do not match, it prints 'no'.
   - The function then tries to align the screenshots by inserting the user who took the screenshot at appropriate positions, ensuring the remaining elements match across all screenshots.

3. **Verification of Logic**:
   - The function correctly identifies the positions where the user who took the screenshot should be inserted to match the other screenshot.
   - It handles the case where multiple screenshots need to be aligned by checking the relative positions of the users in subsequent screenshots.
   - The function correctly processes all test cases and prints 'yes' if all screenshots can be aligned, otherwise 'no'.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases like when only one screenshot is provided and when the screenshots are already aligned.
   - It correctly manages the insertion logic and checks the alignment of all screenshots.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the provided execution summary and the detailed analysis of the code, the function appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
