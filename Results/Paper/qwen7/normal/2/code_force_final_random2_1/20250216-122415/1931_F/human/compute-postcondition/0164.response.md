Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Given Information:
- The loop runs `t` times.
- In each iteration, `a3` is the first integer from the input split, and `l3` is the remaining integers from the input split.
- The loop continues as long as `l3` is not equal to a list containing all elements of `l` except for `a3`.
- If `l3` ever equals the required list, the loop breaks, and 'no' is printed.
- If the loop completes without breaking, 'yes' is printed.
- `val` holds the history of all pairs (`a3`, `l3`) from each iteration.

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `val` contains the history of all pairs (`a3`, `l3`) from previous iterations.
- `a3` is the first integer from the input split on the current iteration.
- `l3` is the remaining integers from the input split on the current iteration.
- The loop will continue to iterate as long as `l3` is not equal to a list containing all elements of `l` except for `a3`.

### Loop Head:
```
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop variable `_` is just a placeholder and does not change during the loop.
- The variables that can change within the loop are `a3` and `l3`.
- The condition for continuing the loop is based on `l3`, which needs to be checked against a specific list derived from `l`.

### Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:
- `a3` will be updated to the first integer from the input split on the next iteration.
- `l3` will be updated to the remaining integers from the input split on the next iteration.
- The condition for continuing the loop depends on `l3`, but since `l3` is derived from the input split, it will be updated accordingly.

### Conclusion:
At the start of the next iteration, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `a3` will be the first integer from the input split.
- `l3` will be the remaining integers from the input split.

### Final Answer:
State: **`val` will be a list containing tuples of (`a3`, `l3`) for each iteration of the loop, with `a3` being the first integer from the input split on the next iteration and `l3` being the remaining integers from the input split.**
State: **`val` will hold the history of all pairs (`a3`, `l3`) from each iteration, and the final output will be 'yes' if the condition is met for all iterations, otherwise 'no'.**
