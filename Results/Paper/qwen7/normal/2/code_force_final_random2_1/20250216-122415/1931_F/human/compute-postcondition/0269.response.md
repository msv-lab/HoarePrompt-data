Output State: **`idx1` is either `n-2` or `-1`, `idx2` is `n-2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 1, `val` is an empty list, and the value of `a2` has been inserted into `val` at index `idx1`.**

Explanation: The code `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the value of `a2` into the list `l2` at the position specified by `idx1`. Since `l2` is not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it is the same as `val`. The values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `n`, and `val` remain unchanged except for the insertion of `a2` at index `idx1` in `val`.
