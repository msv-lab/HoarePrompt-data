Output State: **p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, i is n-2, idx1 is n-2, idx2 is n-2, and val is an empty list. We continue the loop or iteration.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next iteration. Therefore, the values of `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, and `val` remain unchanged, and the loop continues.
