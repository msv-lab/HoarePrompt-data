Output State: **`i` is `k+3`, `idx1` is `k+3`, `idx2` is either `k+3` or remains the same, `p1` and `p2` remain the same, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the code, the values of these variables remain unchanged, and the statement indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
