Output State: **`a3` is the first integer from the new input split, `l3` is a list containing the remaining integers from the new input split, `val` is a list containing a tuple of (`a3`, `l3`), `m - 2` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code `val.append((a3, l3))` appends a tuple containing `a3` and `l3` to the list `val`. This does not change the values of `a3` or `l3`, nor does it affect the condition `m - 2 > 1`. Therefore, the output state remains as described in the initial state, with the addition that the tuple `(a3, l3)` is now part of the list `val`.
