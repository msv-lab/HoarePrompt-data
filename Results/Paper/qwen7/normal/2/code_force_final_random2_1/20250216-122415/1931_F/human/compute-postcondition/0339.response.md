Output State: **`val` contains 1 tuple, `m` is 1, `t` must be at least 1, `a1` is an integer from the input, `l1` is a list of integers from the input (excluding any instances of `a2`), `a2` is an integer from the input, `l2` is a list of integers from the input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding any instances of `a1`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `l22` which contains elements from `l2` excluding any instances of `a1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
