Output State: **`idx1` is either `n-2` or `-1`, `idx2` is `n-2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `i` is `n-1`, `val` is an empty list, `a1` is inserted at index `n-2` in list `l1`.**

Explanation: The code `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the element `a1` into the list `l1` at the index specified by `idx2`, which is `n-2`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `idx1` remains either `n-2` or `-1`, `idx2` remains `n-2`, `p1` and `p2` remain 1, `i` remains `n-1`, and `val` remains an empty list.
