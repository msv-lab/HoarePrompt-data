Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `val` is an empty list, and we continue to the next iteration or block of code.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of execution to skip any remaining code in the current iteration of the loop and move directly to the next iteration. Since there is no loop or specific block being iterated over in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement simply indicates that the program will proceed to the next iteration or block of code, without changing the values of the variables `n`, `m`, or `val`.
