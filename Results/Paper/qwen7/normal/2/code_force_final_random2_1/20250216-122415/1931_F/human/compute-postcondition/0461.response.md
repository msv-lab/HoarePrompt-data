Output State: **`m` must be at least 3, `a3` is the first integer from input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from input, `val` is a list containing one tuple: the first tuple is (`a3`, `l3`).**

Explanation: The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the first integer to `a3`. The remaining integers are collected into a list `l3`. The variable `val` is updated to contain a list with a single tuple, which consists of `a3` and `l3`. The precondition that `m` must be at least 3 remains unchanged.
