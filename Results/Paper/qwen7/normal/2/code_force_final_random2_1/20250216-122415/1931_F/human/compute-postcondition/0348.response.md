Output State: **`m` must be at least 5 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next one. Since no variables are modified by this statement, the only information that changes is that we continue the loop. The precondition that `m` must be at least 5 remains unchanged.
