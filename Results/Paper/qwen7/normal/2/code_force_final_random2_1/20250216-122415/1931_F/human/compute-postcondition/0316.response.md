Output State: **`val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples, `a3` and `l3` are the values from the current tuple in `val` during each iteration. The current value of `l3` is not equal to a list obtained by iterating over `l` and excluding all elements that are equal to `a3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the loop or the most internal if statement. Since the `break` statement does not modify the values of `val`, `a3`, or `l3`, these variables retain their previous states. The only change is that the loop or if statement is exited.
