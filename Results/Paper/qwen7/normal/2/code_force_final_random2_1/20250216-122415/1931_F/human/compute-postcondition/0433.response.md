Output State: **p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, i is n-2, idx1 is n-2, idx2 is n-2, val is a list containing ['a1'], l is undefined, a1 is in val at index idx2.**

Explanation: The line `l = l1` assigns the value of `l1` to `l`. However, since `l1` is not defined in the initial state or within the given code snippet, `l` remains undefined. All other variables retain their initial values or positions as described in the initial state.
