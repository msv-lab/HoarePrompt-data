Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2` (since `range(n - 1)` generates values from 0 to `n - 2`).
3. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
4. **Check the loop condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

Given that `i` is currently 0, the loop will execute again as long as `0 < n - 1`, which simplifies to `n > 1`.

5. **Adjust the states**: Since the only variable in the loop head that can change is `i`, and it will be incremented by 1, `i` will become 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `i` is 1, `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is 0**.
