To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the loop head and identify the relevant variables and conditions:

### Loop Head Analysis
The loop head is:
```python
for (a3, l3) in val:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

- **Variables in the loop head**: `a3`, `l3`, and `val`.

### Conditions for Loop Execution
- The loop iterates over the elements in `val`.
- Each element in `val` is a tuple `(a3, l3)`.

### State Adjustments
- **`val`**: The loop will execute `m - 2` times, and `val` will contain `m - 2` tuples. Therefore, `val` must be a list containing `m - 2` tuples.
- **`a3` and `l3`**: These variables are part of the tuple `(a3, l3)` that is iterated over. For each iteration, `a3` and `l3` will take the values from the current tuple in `val`.

### Final Values After Loop Completion
- After the loop completes, `m` will be set to 2, indicating that the loop ran `m - 2` times.

### Adjusted States
Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `val` must be a list containing `m - 2` tuples.
- `a3` and `l3` will take the values from the current tuple in `val` during each iteration.

### Final Answer
State: **`val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples, `a3` and `l3` are the values from the current tuple in `val` during each iteration**.
