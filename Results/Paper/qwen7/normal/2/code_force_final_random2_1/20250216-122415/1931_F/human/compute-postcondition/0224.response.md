Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1 to become `k+2`, `idx1` is now `i`, `idx2` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `p1` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `p2` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `n` remains greater than 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that `i` has been incremented by 1 to become `k+2`, and `idx1` is now set to the new value of `i`. The values of `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `n` remain unchanged from their previous states, and the condition of breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement is still in effect.
