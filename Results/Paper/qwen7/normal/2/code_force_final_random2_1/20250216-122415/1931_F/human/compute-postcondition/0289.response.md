Output State: **`idx1` is either `n-2` or `-1`, `idx2` is `n-2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 1, `val` is an empty list, `a1` is inserted into `l1` at index `n-2`, `l` is equal to `l1`, and the input is split into `a3` and `l3` where `a3` is the first element and `l3` is a list of the remaining elements.**

Explanation: The line `l = l1` simply assigns the value of `l1` to `l`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `n`, `val`, `a1`, `a3`, and `l3` remain unchanged.
