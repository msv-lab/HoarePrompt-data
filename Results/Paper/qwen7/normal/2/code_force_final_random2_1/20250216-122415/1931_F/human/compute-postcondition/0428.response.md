Output State: **`p1` is either 0 or 1; `p2` is either 0 or 1; `i` is `n-2`; `idx1` is `n-2`; `idx2` is `n-2`; `val` is an empty list; `a2` is inserted into `l2` at index `idx1`.**

Explanation: The code `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the value of `a2` into the list `l2` at the index specified by `idx1`. Since `idx1` is equal to `n-2`, `a2` is inserted at the position `n-2` in the list `l2`. The values of `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, and `val` remain unchanged.
