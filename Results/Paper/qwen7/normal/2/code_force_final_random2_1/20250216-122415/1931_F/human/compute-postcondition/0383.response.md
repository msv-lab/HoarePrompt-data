Postcondition: `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `i` is 0, `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]` is true, then either `p1` is set to 1 or the condition `l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1` is true, leading to breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `p1` remains 0, `p2` remains 0, `i` remains 0, `idx1` remains 0, and `idx2` remains 0, and the program also breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
