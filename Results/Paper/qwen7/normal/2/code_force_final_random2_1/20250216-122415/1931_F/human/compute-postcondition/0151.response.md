Postcondition: `val` must contain at least one tuple, `a3` is the first element of the first tuple in `val`, and `l3` is the second element of the first tuple in `val`. If the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]` is not equal to `l3`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
