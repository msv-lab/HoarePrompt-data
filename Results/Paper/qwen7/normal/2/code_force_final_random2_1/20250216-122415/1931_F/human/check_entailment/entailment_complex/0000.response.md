### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining if there exists an initial order of participants such that all given screenshots can be obtained by inserting the respective participant's name at the top of the list.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Each screenshot represents the view of a participant, with the participant themselves always at the top.
   - The goal is to find if there is a consistent order of participants that can generate all the given screenshots through a series of insertions.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function reads the input for each test case and processes the screenshots.
   - It checks if the remaining elements in the two initial screenshots (`l1` and `l2`) are the same after removing the top element (the author of the screenshot).
   - If they are the same, it proceeds to check further screenshots.
   - If they differ, it determines the correct position to insert the missing author and continues checking subsequent screenshots.

4. **Detailed Breakdown**:
   - **Initial Checks**: The function handles simple cases where only one screenshot is provided or the first two screenshots are identical.
   - **Insertion Logic**: The function attempts to find the correct positions to insert the missing authors and ensures that all subsequent screenshots match the expected order.
   - **Validation Loop**: After processing all screenshots, it validates if the final order matches the expected sequence.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles cases where the initial screenshots differ but can still be aligned through insertions.
   - It properly checks for inconsistencies and prints 'NO' if any discrepancy is found.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The function logic aligns with the problem requirements and correctly identifies whether a consistent order exists for all screenshots.
   - The code handles various edge cases and ensures that the final output is accurate.
