Postcondition: `idx1` and `idx2` are integers, `p1` and `p2` are non-negative integers, `n` is greater than 1. If `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `l2[i + p2]`, then:

- `idx1` and `idx2` are set to either `i` and `-1`, or `-1` and `i`.
- `p1` and `p2` are set to either `1` and `0`, or `0` and `1`.
- If `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
