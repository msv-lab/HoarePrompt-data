Output State: **`i` is `k+3`, `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` and `p2` remain the same, and if `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code sets both `idx1` and `idx2` to the current value of `i`. Since `i` was previously `k+3`, both `idx1` and `idx2` are now `i`. The values of `p1`, `p2`, and the condition involving `i`, `max(p1, p2)`, and `n-1` remain unchanged.
