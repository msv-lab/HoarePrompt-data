Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that `n` is at least 4, `i` is 2, `m` is `m + 9`, `a1` is the first integer from input, `a2` is the second integer from input, `l2` is a list of remaining integers from input with `a2` inserted at index `n - 2`, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `val` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the value of `a2` into the list `l2` at the index specified by `idx1`, which is `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
