Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer from input, `m` is 1, and we continue the loop or iteration.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of execution to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed directly to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, their previous values remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer from input, and `m` is 1 remains valid after the execution of the `continue` statement.
