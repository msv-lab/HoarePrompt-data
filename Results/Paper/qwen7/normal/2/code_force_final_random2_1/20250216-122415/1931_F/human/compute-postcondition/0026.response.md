Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer from input, `m` is `m-2 + 3 = m`, `a1` is the first integer from input, `a2` is the second integer from input, `l2` is a list of remaining integers from input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1.**

The code initializes two variables, `idx1` and `idx2`, both to -1. This does not affect the values of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state retains the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l2`, and `l22` as they were in the initial state.
