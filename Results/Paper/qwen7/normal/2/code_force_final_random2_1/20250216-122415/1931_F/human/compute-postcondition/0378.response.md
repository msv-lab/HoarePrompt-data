Output State: **`p1` is 1, `p2` is 0, `i` is 0, `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional block that was checking the conditions specified in the initial state. The values of `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `idx1`, and `idx2` remain unchanged, and the break statement indicates that we exit the current loop or conditional structure.
