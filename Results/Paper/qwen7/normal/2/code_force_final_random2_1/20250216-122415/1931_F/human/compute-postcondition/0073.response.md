Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` must be at least 3, `i` is 2, `m` is `m + 1`, `a1` is the first integer from input, `a2` is the second integer from input, `l2` is a list of remaining integers from input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is 2, 1, or -1, `idx2` is 2, 1, or -1, `p1` is 1 or 0, `p2` is 1 or 0, and if `i + max(p1, p2)` equals `n - 1` or `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, then `idx1` is 2, 1, or -1, `idx2` is 2, 1, or -1, `p1` is 1 or 0, `p2` is 1 or 0, and if `i + max(p1, p2)` equals `n - 1` or `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
