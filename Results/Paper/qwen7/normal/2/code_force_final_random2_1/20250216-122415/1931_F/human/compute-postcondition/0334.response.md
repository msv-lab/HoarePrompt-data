Output State: **`val` contains 1 tuple, `m` is 1, `t` must be at least 1, and we continue inside the loop or iteration.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables `val`, `m`, `t`, or `n`, and the input from the user remains unchanged, these variables retain their initial states. The only effect of the `continue` statement is to proceed to the next iteration of the loop.
