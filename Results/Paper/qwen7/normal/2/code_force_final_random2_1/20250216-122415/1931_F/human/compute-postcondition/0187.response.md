State: **`idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(n - 1):`, which means the loop will iterate from `0` to `n-2`.
2. For the loop to execute, the expression `n - 1` must be non-negative, meaning `n - 1 >= 0` or equivalently `n >= 1`.
3. Since the loop iterates `n - 1` times, `n` must be at least 2 (because if `n` is 1, the range would be from `0` to `0-1`, which is an empty range).
4. The variables `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` are not directly involved in determining whether the loop can execute; they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `n` is greater than 1.
