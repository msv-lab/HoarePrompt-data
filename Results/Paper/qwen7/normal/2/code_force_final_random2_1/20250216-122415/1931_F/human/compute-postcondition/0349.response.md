Postcondition: **`val` contains 1 tuple, `m` is at least 5, `t` must be at least 1, `a1` is an integer from the input, `l1` is a list of integers from the input (excluding any instances of `a2`), `a2` is an integer from the input, `l2` is a list of integers from the input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding any instances of `a1`. If `l11 != l22`, then `m` remains at least 5 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop. If `l11 == l22`, then no change occurs to the variables.**
