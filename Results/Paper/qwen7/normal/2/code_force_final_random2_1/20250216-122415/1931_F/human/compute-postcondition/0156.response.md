Postcondition: `val` must contain at least one tuple, `a3` is the first element of the first tuple in `val`, and `l3` is the second element of the first tuple in `val`. If `l3` is not equal to a list containing all elements of `l` excluding `a3`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l3` is equal to such a list, the program does nothing (since there is no else part specified).
