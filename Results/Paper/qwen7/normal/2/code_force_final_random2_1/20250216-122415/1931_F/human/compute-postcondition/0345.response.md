Output State: **`m` must be at least 5, input received but not stored or used.**

Explanation: The `input()` function is called but no variable is assigned its return value. Therefore, the value entered by the user is not stored anywhere, and the only thing that remains unchanged from the initial state is that `m` must be at least 5.
