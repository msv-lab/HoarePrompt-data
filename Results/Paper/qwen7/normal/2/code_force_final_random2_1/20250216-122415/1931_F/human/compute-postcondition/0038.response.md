Output State: **`idx1` is 1, `idx2` is 1, `i` is 1, `m` is `m + 1`, `a1` is the first integer from input, `a2` is the second integer from input, `l2` is a list of remaining integers from input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is 1, `idx2` is 1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the implied loop or conditional structure.
