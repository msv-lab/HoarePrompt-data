Output State: **`idx1` is either `n-2` or `-1`, `idx2` is `n-2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 1, `val` is an empty list, `l2` has `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, and `l3.index(a1)` is greater than or equal to `l3.index(a2)`, `l` is equal to `l2`**.

Explanation: The line `l = l2` assigns the value of `l2` to the variable `l`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
