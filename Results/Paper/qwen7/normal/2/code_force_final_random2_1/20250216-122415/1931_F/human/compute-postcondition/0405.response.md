Output State: **`p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 2, `idx1` is 2, `idx2` is 2, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the values of `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `idx1`, and `idx2` remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
