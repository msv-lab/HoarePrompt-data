Postcondition: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that `n` is at least 4, `i` is 2, `m` is `m + 9`, `a1` is the first integer from input, `a2` is the second integer from input, `l2` is a list of remaining integers from input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `val` is an empty list, and `idx1` is not greater than `idx2`. Additionally, the current value of `m` is equal to 2.
