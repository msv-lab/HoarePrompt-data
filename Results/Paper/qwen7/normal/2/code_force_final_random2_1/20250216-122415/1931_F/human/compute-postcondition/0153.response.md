Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `a3` and `l3`, which are derived from the tuples in the list `val`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `val` contains at least one tuple. The values of `a3` and `l3` are set to the first tuple in `val` at the start of each iteration.

3. **Postcondition Analysis**: The postcondition states that `l3` should be the second element of the first tuple in `val`, and it should match a list containing all elements of `l` except for `a3`. If `l3` does not match this condition, the loop breaks. Otherwise, no specific action is taken.

4. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `val` must contain at least one tuple.
   - `a3` is the first element of the first tuple in `val`.
   - `l3` is the second element of the first tuple in `val`.
   - If `l3` is not equal to a list containing all elements of `l` except for `a3`, the loop breaks.

5. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `val` contains at least one tuple, we need to ensure that `val` still contains at least one tuple.
   - `a3` and `l3` will be updated to the first tuple in `val` for the next iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `val` still contains at least one tuple, and `a3` and `l3` will be updated to the first tuple in `val`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`val` must contain at least one tuple, `a3` is the first element of the first tuple in `val`, and `l3` is the second element of the first tuple in `val`.**
