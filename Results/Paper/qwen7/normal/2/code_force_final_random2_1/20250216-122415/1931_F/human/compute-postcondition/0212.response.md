Output State: **`idx1` is `i` and `idx2` is `-1`, or `idx1` is `-1` and `idx2` is `i`; `p1` is `1` and `p2` is `0`, or `p1` is `0` and `p2` is `1`; `n` is greater than `1`; `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`, or `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`; we break out of the loop or condition we were inside.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the current loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or condition that was checking the values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `n`, `l1[i + p1]`, and `l2[i + p2]`. The values of these variables remain unchanged except for the fact that we are now outside the loop or condition.
