Postcondition: `val` contains `m - 3` tuples, `a3` and `l3` are the values from the next tuple in `val`, and if `l3` is not equal to a list comprehension excluding `a3` from `l`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l3` is equal to the list comprehension, the values remain as they were checked.
