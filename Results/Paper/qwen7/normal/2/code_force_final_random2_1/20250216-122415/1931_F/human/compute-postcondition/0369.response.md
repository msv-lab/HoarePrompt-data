Output State: **`p1` is 1, `p2` is 0, `i` is 0, `idx1` is 0, the elements at index `i + p1` in list `l1` are equal to `a2`, the elements at index `i + p2` in list `l2` are not equal to `a1`.**

Explanation: The value of `p1` is updated to 1, while the values of `p2`, `i`, `idx1`, the elements at index `i + p1` in list `l1`, and the elements at index `i + p2` in list `l2` remain unchanged from their initial states.
