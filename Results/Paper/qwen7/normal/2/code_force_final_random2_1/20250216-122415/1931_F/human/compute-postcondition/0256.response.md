Output State: **`idx1` is either `k+3` or `k+2`, `idx2` is either `k+3` or `k+2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 1, `val` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `val`. This does not affect the values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, or `n`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The only new variable introduced is `val`, which is now an empty list.
