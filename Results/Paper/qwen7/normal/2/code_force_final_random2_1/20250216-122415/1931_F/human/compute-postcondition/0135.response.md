Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(m - 2):`. The only variable involved here is `m`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute if `m - 2` is at least 1. This means `m` must be at least 3.

3. **Adjust the States**: Based on the condition identified, we need to ensure that `m` is at least 3. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`) do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `m` to ensure it is at least 3.

**State:**
**`m` must be at least 3**
