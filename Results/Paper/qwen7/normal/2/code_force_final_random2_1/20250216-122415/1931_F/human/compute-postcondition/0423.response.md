Postcondition: **p1 is either 0 or 1, p2 is either 0 or 1, i is n-2, idx1 is n-2, idx2 is either 0, 1, ..., n-3 or -1, and val is an empty list.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. If the condition `idx1 == -1 and idx2 != -1` is true, then `idx1` is set to `n-2`. Otherwise, the values of `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `idx2`, and `val` remain unchanged from the precondition.
