Based on the initial state provided:

- `val` contains at least one tuple.
- `a3` is the first element of the first tuple in `val`.
- `l3` is the second element of the first tuple in `val`.
- The current value of `l3` is not equal to a list containing all elements of `l` except for `a3`.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'no'`.

Output: **no**
