Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer from input, `m` is 1, `a1` is the first integer from input, `a2` is the second integer from input, `l2` is a list of remaining integers from input, `l11` is a list containing elements of `l1` excluding `a2`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `l11` which contains all elements from the original list `l1` except for `a2`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `a2`, and `l2` remain unchanged.
