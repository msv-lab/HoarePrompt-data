Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(m - 2):`. The variables involved here are `m`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `m - 2` iterations. For the loop to execute again, `m` must be at least 5 (since if `m` is 4, the loop would run for 2 iterations, and if `m` is 5, the loop would run for 3 iterations).

3. **State at the end of the previous iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration, `m` must be at least 4.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be at least 5.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `m` must be at least 5.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`m` must be at least 5**
