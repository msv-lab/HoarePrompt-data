Output State: **`val` contains `m - 2` tuples, `a3` and `l3` are the values from the next tuple in `val`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement simply indicates that we are breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement we are currently inside. The values of `val`, `a3`, and `l3` remain unchanged.
