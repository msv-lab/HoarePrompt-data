Based on the initial state provided:

- `val` contains at least one tuple.
- `a3` is the first element of the next tuple in `val`.
- `l3` is the second element of that tuple.

However, the `print` statement simply outputs the string `'no'`.

Since the `print` statement does not reference `a3` or `l3`, and only outputs a fixed string, the output will be:

Output: **no**
