Postcondition: `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, and either `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` is true, in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or the condition `l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1` is false, and `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`.
