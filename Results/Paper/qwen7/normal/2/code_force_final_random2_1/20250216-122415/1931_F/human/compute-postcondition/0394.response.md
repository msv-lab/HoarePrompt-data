Postcondition: `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `idx1`, and `idx2` are integers. If `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, then `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0, `i` is 1, `idx1` is 1, and `idx2` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 1, `i` is 1, `idx1` is 0, and `idx2` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
