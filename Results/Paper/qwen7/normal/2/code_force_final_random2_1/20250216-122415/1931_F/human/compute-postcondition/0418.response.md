Output State: `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `n-2`, `idx1` is either 0, 1, ..., `n-2` or -1, `idx2` is either 0, 1, ..., `n-2` or -1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the value of `i` will be `n-2` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-2` (inclusive). The values of `p1` and `p2` can only be 0 or 1 since they are set to 1 only once per condition check and the loop does not reset them. The values of `idx1` and `idx2` can range from 0 to `n-2` or be set to -1 if no conditions are met throughout the loop iterations. The loop breaks as soon as any of its conditions are met, so the final values of `idx1` and `idx2` depend on when these conditions were last satisfied during the loop's execution.
