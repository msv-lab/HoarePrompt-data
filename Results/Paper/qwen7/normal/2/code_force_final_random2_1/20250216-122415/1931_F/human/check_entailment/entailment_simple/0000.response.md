### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `m` (the number of participants and the number of screenshots, respectively).

2. **Single Screenshot Case**: If only one screenshot is provided (`m == 1`), the program prints "yes" because the order of participants seen by each user would match their own position in the list.

3. **Comparing Two Screenshots**:
   - The program compares the first two screenshots (`a1` and `a2`) and extracts the common elements (`l11` and `l22`). If these lists do not match, it prints "no" and continues to the next test case.
   - If the lists match, it proceeds to find the positions where the unique elements appear in both lists (`a1` and `a2`).

4. **Finding Insertion Points**:
   - The program tries to find the correct insertion points for `a1` and `a2` in the respective lists.
   - If the insertion points are found, it constructs a new list `l` with the appropriate insertions and checks subsequent screenshots against this constructed list.

5. **Checking Subsequent Screenshots**:
   - For each subsequent screenshot, the program checks if the list matches the expected order after removing the unique element (`a3`).
   - If any screenshot does not match, it prints "no" and breaks out of the loop.
   - If all screenshots match, it prints "yes".

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the unique elements might appear at the end of the list, ensuring the correct order is maintained.
   - It also handles cases where the unique elements appear in the same position in both lists, allowing for flexibility in the order construction.

Given the detailed handling of the input and the logic to construct and verify the order of participants, the program appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly identifies whether there exists an order of participants that corresponds to all given screenshots.
