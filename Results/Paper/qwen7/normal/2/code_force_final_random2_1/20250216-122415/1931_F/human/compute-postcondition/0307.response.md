Output State: **`a3` is the first integer from the input split, `l3` is a list containing the remaining integers from the input split, `val` is a list containing a tuple of (`a3`, `l3`), `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, and the tuple (`a3`, `l3`) has been appended to `val`.**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple containing `a3` and `l3` to the list `val`. Since `a3` and `l3` are unchanged, their values remain the same. The list `val` now contains the original tuple plus the newly appended tuple. The condition for `m` remains unchanged.
