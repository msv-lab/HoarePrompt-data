### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Checks:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of participants `n` and the number of screenshots `m`.
   - If `m == 1`, it prints 'yes' and continues to the next test case. This part is correct.

2. **Initial Screenshot Comparison:**
   - The function reads the first two screenshots and compares the lists `l1` and `l2` after removing the author from each list.
   - If these lists are not equal, it prints 'no' and skips further checks. This part is correct.

3. **Index Calculation and List Insertion:**
   - The function calculates indices `idx1` and `idx2` where the author of the second screenshot appears in the first list and vice versa.
   - Based on these indices, it decides which list to modify and inserts the author at the calculated index.
   - The logic here is flawed. The indices are not always correctly calculated, and the conditions under which the lists are modified are too restrictive. For example, the function assumes that the author will always be found at a specific position, which is not necessarily true.

4. **Handling Multiple Screenshots:**
   - The function iterates over the remaining screenshots and checks if they match the modified list after removing the author.
   - If any screenshot does not match, it prints 'no'.
   - If all screenshots match, it prints 'yes'.
   - However, the way the function handles the insertion of the author and the comparison of subsequent screenshots is problematic. The function does not account for all possible permutations of the list, and the logic for handling multiple screenshots is overly simplistic.

### Issues Identified:
- **Index Handling:** The logic for calculating `idx1` and `idx2` is flawed. It assumes that the indices will always be found in a straightforward manner, which may not be true.
- **List Modification:** The insertion logic is overly complex and may not handle all edge cases correctly.
- **Edge Cases:** The function does not handle all possible edge cases, such as when the lists are already sorted or when the indices are not found.
- **General Logic:** The overall logic of the function is not robust enough to handle all possible scenarios, especially when dealing with multiple screenshots and varying positions of the author in the lists.

### Correctness:
Given the identified issues, the function does not handle all possible cases correctly. Therefore, the given program is **incorrect**.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
