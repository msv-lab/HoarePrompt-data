Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer from input, `m` must be greater than 2, `a1` is the first integer from input, `a2` is the second integer from input, `l2` is a list of remaining integers from input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, the current value of `l11` is not equal to `l22`, an additional input is taken.**

Explanation: The code `input()` simply takes an input from the user, which does not affect the existing values of the variables. It only adds the fact that an additional input has been taken. All other variables retain their previous states.
