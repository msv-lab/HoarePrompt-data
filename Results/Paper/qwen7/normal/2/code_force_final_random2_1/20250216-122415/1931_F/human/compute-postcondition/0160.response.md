Output State: **`val` must contain at least one tuple, `a3` is the first element of the next tuple in `val`, and `l3` is the second element of that tuple, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block immediately preceding the `break` statement, it indicates that we are breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. The values of `val`, `a3`, and `l3` remain unchanged.
