Based on the initial state provided:

- `val` contains `m - 3` tuples.
- `a3` and `l3` are values from the next tuple in `val`.
- There is a condition where `l3` is not equal to a list comprehension excluding `a3` from `l`, in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or if there is no else part and the values remain as they were checked.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'no'`.

Since the print statement does not depend on the values of `a3`, `l3`, or any other variables but only outputs a fixed string, the output will be:

Output: **no**
