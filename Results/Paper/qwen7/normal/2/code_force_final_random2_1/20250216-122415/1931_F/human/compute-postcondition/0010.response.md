Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer from input, `m` is 1, `a1` is the first integer from input, `a2` is the second integer from input, and `l2` is a list of remaining integers from input.**

Explanation: The code `a2, *l2 = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the first element to `a2` and the rest to `l2`. The initial values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, and the list `l1` remain unchanged.
