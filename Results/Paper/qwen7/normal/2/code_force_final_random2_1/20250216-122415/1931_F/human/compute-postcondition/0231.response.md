Postcondition: **`i` is `k+2`, `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `p1` is 1, `p2` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration, and `n` remains greater than 1.**

This means that regardless of whether the condition `idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0` is true or false, the final state of the variables will be as described. If the condition is true, the most internal loop or if statement is broken, and the specified values are set. If the condition is false, the values remain unchanged from the end of the previous iteration.
