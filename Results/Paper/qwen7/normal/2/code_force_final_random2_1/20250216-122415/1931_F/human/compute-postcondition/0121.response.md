Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that `n` is at least 4, `i` is 2, `m` is 2, `a1` is the first integer from input, `a2` is the second integer from input, `l2` is a list of remaining integers from input, `l3` is a list containing the third integer from input and the rest of the integers from input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`, `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 1 or 0, `val` is an empty list, and `idx1` is not greater than `idx2`.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers using `input().split()` and then converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The first two integers are assigned to `a1` and `a2`, and the rest are unpacked into `a3` and stored in `l3`. The other variables remain unchanged.
