Postcondition: `idx1` is `i` and `idx2` is `-1`, or `idx1` is `-1` and `idx2` is `i`. Additionally, `p1` is `1` and `p2` is `0`, or `p1` is `0` and `p2` is `1`. `n` is greater than `1`, and either `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` does not equal `a1`, or `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `l2[i + p2]`.
