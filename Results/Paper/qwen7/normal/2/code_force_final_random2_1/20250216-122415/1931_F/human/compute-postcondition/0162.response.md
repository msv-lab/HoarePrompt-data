Output State: `val` is a list containing tuples, where each tuple consists of the last `a3` and `l3` values from each iteration of the loop. Specifically, `a3` is the first element of each tuple, and `l3` is the second element. After all iterations, `a3` and `l3` will contain the last set of integers entered by the user, as they were split from the input on the last iteration of the loop. If `l3` is not equal to a list containing all elements of `l` except for `a3`, the loop will break and print 'no'. Otherwise, if the loop completes without breaking, it will print 'yes'.

In summary, `val` will hold a record of all pairs `(a3, l3)` collected during each iteration, and the final `a3` and `l3` will be the last pair collected.
