Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer greater than 0.
- `n` is an integer from input.
- `m` must be greater than 3.
- `a1` is the first integer from input.
- `a2` is the second integer from input.
- `l2` is a list of remaining integers from input.
- `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`.
- The current value of `l11` is not equal to `l22`.
- An additional input is taken for each iteration of the loop, and this process repeats until the loop completes its specified number of iterations (`m-2`).
- After all iterations, the value of `m` will be exactly `m-2 + 3 = m`.
- The variable `l11` will still not be equal to `l22`.
- Each input taken during the loop iterations is stored according to its type (string or integer).

The `print('no')` statement simply outputs the string "no".

Output: **no**
