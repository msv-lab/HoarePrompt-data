Output State: `idx1` is either `k+3` or `k+2`, `idx2` is either `k+3` or `k+2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 1.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-2`. The conditions inside the loop ensure that `idx1` and `idx2` are updated to `i` (or `k+3`) and `p1` and `p2` are set to 1 when certain conditions are met. Since the loop breaks when `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` or when both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, by the end of the loop, `idx1` and `idx2` will be set to `k+3` or `k+2` and `p1` and `p2` will be 1.
