Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is `k+3`, `idx1` is either `i` or `k+3`, `idx2` is either `k+3` or `i`, `p1` is either 1 or remains the same, `p2` is either 1 or remains the same, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the most internal loop or if statement. However, no variables are updated or reassigned within this statement itself. Therefore, the values of `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged from their previous states. The condition `if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` is not evaluated or affected by the `break` statement.
