Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ans` is equal to the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for every element `x` in the list `cnt`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `a`. The initial state of `n` and `ans` remains unchanged. The variable `cnt` is not mentioned in the code, so its state is not affected.
