Output State: **The variable `a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a list of 10001 zeros where each index represents an integer from 0 to 10000, and `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. This does not affect the lists `a` and `cnt`. Therefore, the list `a` remains unchanged, and `cnt` still holds the frequency count of each integer found in the list `a`. The value of `ans` is set to 0.
