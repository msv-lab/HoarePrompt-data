Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for x in a:`. The variables involved here are `x` and `a`.

2. **Understand the Initial State**:
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for every element `x` in the list `cnt`.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
   - `cnt` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is 0.

3. **Determine What Needs to Be Adjusted**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `a`, the variable `x` will take on the values of the elements in `a` during each iteration.
   - The variable `a` itself is a list, and its contents (the elements) will change as the loop progresses, but the list `a` itself remains the same list throughout the loop.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that the list `a` contains at least one element for the loop to execute. If `a` is empty, the loop will not run at all.
   - The initial value of `x` is not specified, but it will take on the values of the elements in `a` during each iteration.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `a` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
- `x` will take on the values of the elements in `a` during each iteration, but since we don't know the exact values, we focus on ensuring `a` has elements.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`a` must contain at least one element**.
