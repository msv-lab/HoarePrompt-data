Output State: **`a` is a list of integers that contains at least two elements, `x` is the third element in the list `a`, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` elements where the first element is 1 and the second element is 1, `ans` is 10000, `cnt[x]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt[x] += 1` increments the value of `cnt` at index `x` by 1. Since `x` is the third element in the list `a`, the value of `cnt[x]` is updated. All other variables remain unchanged.
