Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `cnt` is a list of 10001 zeros, `x` is 0, `ans` is 1**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by adding the maximum of 0 and `x - 1`. Since `x` is initially 0, `x - 1` equals -1. The maximum of 0 and -1 is 0. Therefore, `ans` is incremented by 0, making `ans` equal to 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
