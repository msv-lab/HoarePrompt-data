#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n represents the integers on the cards in your hand, where each integer from 1 through n appears at most twice. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func():
    for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:
        elements = line.split()
        
        print(sum(elements.count(item) // 3 for item in {*elements}))
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will process every second line starting from the third line of the input, up to the last line. For each line processed, `elements` will be a list of strings obtained by splitting the string stored in `line`. The `print` statement will output the sum of counts of each unique item in `elements` divided by 3.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the program will have processed all lines that meet the criteria (starting from the third line and every second line thereafter), and for each of these lines, it will have calculated and printed the sum of the counts of each unique element in the split line, divided by 3.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases from standard input. For each test case, it reads a line starting from the third line and every second line thereafter, splits the line into elements, and calculates the sum of counts of each unique element in the split line, dividing each count by 3. It then prints this sum for each qualifying line.
