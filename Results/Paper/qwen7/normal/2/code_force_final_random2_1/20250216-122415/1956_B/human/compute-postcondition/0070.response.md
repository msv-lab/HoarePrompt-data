Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) and a list of integers \( a \). It then calculates the sum of \( \text{max}(0, x - 1) \) for each unique integer \( x \) in the list \( a \), and prints this sum for each test case. The final state of the program includes the printed results for all test cases.**
