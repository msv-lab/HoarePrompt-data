Output State: The variable `a` is a list of integers, and `cnt` is a list of 10001 zeros where each index represents an integer from 0 to 10000. After all iterations of the loop, `cnt[x]` is incremented for every integer `x` present in the list `a`. This means that `cnt[i]` will contain the total count of occurrences of the integer `i` in the list `a`.

In simpler terms, `cnt` will hold the frequency count of each integer found in the list `a`.
