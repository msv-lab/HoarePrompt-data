Output State: **`a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `cnt` is a list of n+1 zeros, `x` is 0, `ans` is 10000, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code initializes `cnt` as a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`. The values of other variables (`a`, `x`, `ans`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
