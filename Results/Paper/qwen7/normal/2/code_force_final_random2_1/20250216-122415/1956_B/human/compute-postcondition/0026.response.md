Output State: **`a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `cnt` is a list of 10001 zeros, `x` is 0, `ans` is 10000, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user and converts each element into an integer, storing them in the list `a`. The other variables (`cnt`, `x`, `ans`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
