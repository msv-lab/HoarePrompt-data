Output State: **`ans` is 0, `cnt` is updated to reflect the frequency of each integer present in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is initialized to 0 and remains unchanged. The list `cnt` is updated such that for each index `i` from `0` to `n`, `cnt[i]` reflects the number of times `i` appears in the list `a`. All other variables (`a` and `ans`) retain their initial states.
