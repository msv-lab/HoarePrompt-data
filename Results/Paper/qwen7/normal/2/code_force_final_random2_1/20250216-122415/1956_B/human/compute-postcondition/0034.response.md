Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `a` is a list of integers that contains at least `n` elements, `cnt` is a list of `n+1` elements where each element in `cnt` is incremented according to the frequency of each integer in `a`, `x` is the last element in the list `a`, `ans` is still 10000, and `n` is the input integer.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has run through all its iterations, the `cnt` list will show how many times each integer from 0 to `n` appears in the list `a`. The variable `x` will hold the value of the last element processed in `a`, and `ans` and `n` will retain their initial values of 10000 and the input integer value, respectively.
