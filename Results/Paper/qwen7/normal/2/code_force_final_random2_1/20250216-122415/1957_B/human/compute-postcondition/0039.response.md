Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer; `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer. If `n` equals 1, there are no additional changes. Otherwise, `i` is either 1, 2, or 3, `t` remains greater than 0, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer and is not equal to 1, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k0` is equal to `k`, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is a list containing three elements which are (1 << i) - 1, k - ((1 << i) - 1), and 0, and `temp` is either 16, 8, or 4.**
