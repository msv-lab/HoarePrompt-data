Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each `t`, there are two integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9). The function returns different values based on the conditions given for `n` and `k` for each test case.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing `t`, `n`, and `k`. For each test case, it evaluates `n` and `k` to determine the output, but the specific output logic is not detailed here.
