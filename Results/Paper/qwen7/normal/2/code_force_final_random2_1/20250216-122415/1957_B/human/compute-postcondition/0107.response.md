Output State: **`i` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3; `k0` is equal to `k`; `l1` is updated with the split input values; `n` is the new integer from the first split value; `k` is the integer from the second split value; `arr` is an empty list; `ans` contains two elements which are `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - sum(ans)`; `temp` is either 1, 2, 4, or 8 depending on the condition `temp * 2 < k`.**

Explanation: The code appends `k - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` contains one element `(1 << i) - 1`. After appending, `ans` now contains two elements: `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - sum(ans)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
