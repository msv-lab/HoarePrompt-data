Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `l1` is updated with the split input values, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer and is not equal to 1, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer and is equal to `k0`, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is a list containing one element which is `(1 << i) - 1`, `k0` is equal to `k`, `temp` is a power of 2 (either 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.), and the input value for the next iteration is taken, `n` is an integer and `k` is an integer, `arr` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code appends `(1 << i) - 1` to the `ans` list. Since `i` is either 0 or 1, `(1 << i) - 1` evaluates to 0 when `i` is 0 and 1 when `i` is 1. Therefore, `ans` now contains one element, which is `(1 << i) - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
