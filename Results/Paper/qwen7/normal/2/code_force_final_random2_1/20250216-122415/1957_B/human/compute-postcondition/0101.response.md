Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `k0` is equal to `k`, `l1` is updated with the split input values, `n` is the new integer from the first split value, `k` is the integer from the second split value, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, and `temp` is either 1 or 2 depending on the condition `temp * 2 < k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or the most internal if statement. Therefore, the values of all the variables remain the same as their initial states.
