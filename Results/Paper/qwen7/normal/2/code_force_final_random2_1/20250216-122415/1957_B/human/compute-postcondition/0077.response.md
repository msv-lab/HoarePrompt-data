Output State: **`l1` is updated with the split input values, `n` is the new integer input, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer and is equal to `k0`, `arr` is a list with length `n`, `ans` is a list containing either three or two elements depending on the value of `n`, `k0` is equal to `k`, `temp` is a power of 2 (either 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.), `l1` is updated with the split input values.**

Explanation: The code `l1 = input().split()` takes the input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to `l1`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `arr`, `ans`, `k0`, `temp`) remain unchanged in terms of their relationships and values. Therefore, the output state retains the same relationships between these variables, with `l1` being updated to reflect the new input.
