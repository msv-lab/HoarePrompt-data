Based on the initial state provided:

- `l1` is updated with the split input values.
- `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer and is not equal to 1.
- `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer and is equal to `k0`.
- `arr` is an empty list.
- `ans` is a list containing three elements which are `(1 << n) - 1`, `k - ((1 << n) - 1)`, and 0.
- `temp` is either 16, 8, or 4.
- The input value for the next iteration is taken.
- `n` is an integer and `k` is an integer.

The `print(k)` statement will print the value of `k`.

Since `k` is explicitly stated to be the second element of `l1` converted to an integer and is equal to `k0`, the output will be the value of `k0`.

Output: **k0**
