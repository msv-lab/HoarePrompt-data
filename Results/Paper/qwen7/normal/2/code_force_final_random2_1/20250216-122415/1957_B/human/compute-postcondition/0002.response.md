Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer; `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = list(map(int, l1))` takes the list `l1`, which is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, and converts each string to an integer using `map(int, l1)`. It then assigns these integers to the variables `n` and `k`. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
