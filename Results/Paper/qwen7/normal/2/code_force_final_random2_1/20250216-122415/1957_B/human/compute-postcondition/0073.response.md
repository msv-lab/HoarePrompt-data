Output State: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `l1` is updated with the split input values, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer and is not equal to 1, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer and is equal to `k0`, `arr` is a list with length `n`, `ans` is a list containing two elements \((1 << i) - 1\) and \(k - \text{sum(ans)}\), `k0` is equal to `k`, `temp` is a power of 2 (either 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc.), and the input value for the next iteration is taken, `n` is an integer and `k` is an integer.**

Explanation: The line `ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))` appends zeros to the list `ans` until its length matches `n`. Since `ans` initially contains two elements, the number of zeros to append is `n - 2`. This operation does not affect the values of `i`, `l1`, `k`, `arr`, `k0`, `temp`, or the input process for the next iteration.
