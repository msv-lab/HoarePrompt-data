Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer and is not equal to 1; `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer; `k0` is equal to `k`; `arr` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `k0 = k` assigns the value of `k` to `k0`. No other changes are made to the variables. Therefore, the conditions and values of `t`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
