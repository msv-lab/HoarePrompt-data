You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        (n, k) = list(map(int, l1))
        if n == 1:
            print(k)
        else:
            arr = []
            k0 = k
            i = 0
            ans = []
            temp = 1
            while True:
                if temp * 2 < k:
                    temp *= 2
                    i += 1
                else:
                    break
            ans.append((1 << i) - 1)
            ans.append(k - sum(ans))
            ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
            print(*ans)

    #This output state describes the final conditions after all iterations of the loop have completed, with each variable reflecting its state after processing all test cases according to the given logic.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Single Element Case (`n == 1`):**
   - If `n == 1`, the program simply prints `k`. This is correct because the sum must be `k`, and there's only one element, so it must be `k`.

3. **Multiple Elements Case (`n > 1`):**
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the sequence.
   - It calculates `temp` as the highest power of 2 less than `k`.
   - It appends `(1 << i) - 1` to `ans`, where `i` is the exponent found in the loop.
   - It then appends `k - sum(ans)` to `ans`.
   - Finally, it pads the list with zeros to make its length equal to `n`.

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Handling Multiple Elements:**
   - The logic for constructing the sequence is flawed. The goal is to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence.
   - The current approach constructs a sequence where one element is `(1 << i) - 1` (a number with all bits set to 1 up to `i`), another element is `k - sum(ans)`, and the rest are zeros. This does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

2. **Example Test Cases:**
   - For the test case `2 5`, the expected output should be `5 0` or `0 5` to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.
   - However, the program outputs `4 1`, which does not maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

3. **Bitwise OR Maximization:**
   - A better approach would be to distribute the value `k` across the elements in such a way that the bitwise OR of the sequence has the maximum number of 1s.
   - One possible solution is to use the largest possible values that fit within the constraints and ensure their bitwise OR is maximized.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. It fails to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
