Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `_`, which is used as a placeholder and typically ignored in the loop body. However, for the purpose of determining the initial state, we need to consider what `int(input())` returns.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of the Loop Counter**: The expression `int(input())` reads an integer from the input. This integer will determine how many times the loop will execute. For the loop to execute at least once, this integer must be greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the State**: Given that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), we know that `t` could be any value within this range. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
