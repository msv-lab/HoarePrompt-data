The only variable in the loop head is the variable `True`, which is a constant and always evaluates to `True`. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time since the loop will always run.

State: **`i` is 0, `l1` is updated with the split input values, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer and is not equal to 1, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer and is equal to `k0`, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `temp` is 1, the input value for the next iteration is taken, `n` is an integer and `k` is an integer, `arr` is an empty list.**
