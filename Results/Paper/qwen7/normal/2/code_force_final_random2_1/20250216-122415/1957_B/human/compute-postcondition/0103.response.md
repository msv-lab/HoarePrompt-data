Postcondition: `i` is either 0, 1, or 2, `k0` is equal to `k`, `l1` is updated with the split input values, `n` is the new integer from the first split value, `k` is the integer from the second split value, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, and `temp` is either 1, 2, or 4 depending on the condition `temp * 2 < k`. If `temp * 2 < k`, then `i` is increased by 1. If `temp * 2 >= k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
