Since the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, it will always execute at least once regardless of the initial values of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to make the loop execute the first time.

State: **`i` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer and is not equal to 1, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k0` is equal to `k`, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 1**
