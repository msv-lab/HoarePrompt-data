Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Variable `i`**: It can be either 1, 2, or 3.
2. **Variable `t`**: It must be greater than 0, but its specific value is not needed for the print statement.
3. **Variable `n`**: It is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer and is not equal to 1.
4. **Variable `k`**: It is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer.
5. **Variable `k0`**: It is equal to `k`.
6. **Variable `arr`**: It is an empty list.
7. **Variable `ans`**: It is a list containing three elements:
   - The first element is `(1 << i) - 1`
   - The second element is `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`
   - The third element is `0`

The `print(*ans)` statement will unpack the list `ans` and print its elements separated by spaces.

### Calculating the Elements of `ans`:
- **First Element**: `(1 << i) - 1`
  - If `i` is 1, then `(1 << 1) - 1 = 1`
  - If `i` is 2, then `(1 << 2) - 1 = 3`
  - If `i` is 3, then `(1 << 3) - 1 = 7`
  
- **Second Element**: `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`
  - This depends on the value of `k` and `i`.

- **Third Element**: `0`

### Final Output:
Given the above calculations, the output will be a sequence of three numbers, where the first number is `(1 << i) - 1`, the second number is `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`, and the third number is `0`.

Since the exact value of `i` and `k` is not specified, we will express the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **(1 << i) - 1, k - ((1 << i) - 1), 0**
