Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 0, `l1` is updated with the split input values, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer and is not equal to 1, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer and is equal to `k0`, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `temp` is 1, the input value for the next iteration is taken, `n` is an integer and `k` is an integer, `arr` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    if temp * 2 < k:
        temp *= 2
        i += 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is either 0 or 1, `l1` is updated with the split input values, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer and is not equal to 1, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer and is equal to `k0`, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `temp` is either 1 or 2 depending on the condition being true or false, and the input value for the next iteration is taken, `n` is an integer and `k` is an integer, `arr` is an empty list.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is either 0 or 1, `l1` is updated with the split input values, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer and is not equal to 1, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer and is equal to `k0`, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `temp` is either 1 or 2 depending on the condition being true or false, and the input value for the next iteration is taken, `n` is an integer and `k` is an integer, `arr` is an empty list. If `temp * 2 < k`, then `temp` is either 2 or 4. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is either 0 or 1, `l1` is updated with the split input values, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer and is not equal to 1, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer and is equal to `k0`, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `temp` is either 1, 2, 8, or 16 depending on the condition being true or false, and the input value for the next iteration is taken, `n` is an integer and `k` is an integer, `arr` is an empty list. If `temp * 2 < k`, then `temp` is either 2, 4, 8, or 16. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
