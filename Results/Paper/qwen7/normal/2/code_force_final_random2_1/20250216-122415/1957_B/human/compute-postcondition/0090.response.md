Output State: **`i` is 0, `k0` is equal to `k`, `l1` is updated with the split input values, `n` is the new integer from the first split value, `k` is the integer from the second split value, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since no such loop or conditional statement is specified in the code snippet, the only effect is that the execution would exit the current block, which in this case is implied to be a loop or conditional structure. All other variables retain their initial or updated states as given in the initial state description.
