Output State: **Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer and is not equal to 1; `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer; `arr` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `arr`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `l1` remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the postcondition for `t`, the values of `n` and `k` (as elements of `l1`), and the new state of `arr` are included in the output state.
