Output State: **`i` is 1, `l1` is updated with the split input values, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer and is not equal to 1, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer and is equal to `k0`, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `temp` is 2, the input value for the next iteration is taken, `n` is an integer and `k` is an integer, `arr` is an empty list, and the current value of `temp` is less than half of `k`.**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1 from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
