Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it calculates a list \( ans \) based on the value of \( n \) and \( k \). If \( n = 1 \), it simply prints \( k \). Otherwise, it constructs \( ans \) such that it contains two or three elements, where the elements are derived from the binary representation of \( k \). Finally, it prints the constructed list \( ans \) for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function implicitly returns nothing, but the printed output represents the final state of the program.**
