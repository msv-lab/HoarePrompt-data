Postcondition: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `l1` is updated with the split input values, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer and is not equal to 1, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer and is equal to `k0`, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `temp` is either 1 or 2 depending on the condition being true or false, and the input value for the next iteration is taken, `n` is an integer and `k` is an integer, `arr` is an empty list. If `temp * 2 < k`, then `temp` is either 2 or 4. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
