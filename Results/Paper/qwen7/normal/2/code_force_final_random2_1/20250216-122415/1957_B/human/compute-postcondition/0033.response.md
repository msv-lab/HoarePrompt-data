Output State: `i` is a value between 0 and 3 inclusive, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer and is not equal to 1, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k0` is equal to `k`, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, and `temp` is either 16, 8, 4, or 2.

Explanation: The loop continues to double `temp` as long as `temp * 2` is less than `k`. Since `k` is initially set to a value such that `temp` can be doubled up to 3 times before it no longer satisfies the condition (`temp * 2 < k`), `i` will be incremented each time `temp` is doubled. After the loop exits, `i` will be the number of times the loop executed, which can be 0, 1, 2, or 3. `temp` will be the result of doubling starting from 1 up to 3 times, resulting in values of 16, 8, 4, or 2 respectively.
