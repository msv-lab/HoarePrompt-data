Output State: **`cnt` is increased by `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` if gcd(x, y) is 1; `y` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `y += 1` increments the value of `y` by 1. The conditions for increasing `cnt` based on the GCD and the constraints involving `x` and `y` remain unchanged and are still valid. Therefore, the updated state includes that `y` has been incremented by 1, while the conditions for `cnt` remain as they were in the initial state.
