Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `x * x <= n`.
2. **Current values at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is 2
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 3
   - `m` is greater than or equal to 6 (this variable is not part of the loop condition, so it doesn't need to be adjusted)
   - `cnt` is 8 (this variable is not part of the loop condition, so it doesn't need to be adjusted)
   - `y` is 4 (this variable is not part of the loop condition, so it doesn't need to be adjusted)

3. **Determine if the loop can execute one more time**:
   - The current value of `x` is 2.
   - The current value of `n` is greater than or equal to 3.
   - We need to check if `x * x <= n` holds true.

   Since `x = 2`, then `x * x = 4`. For the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4. 

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - The only variable involved in the loop condition is `n`, so we need to ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to 4.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`x` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `m` is greater than or equal to 6, `cnt` is 8, `y` is 4**
