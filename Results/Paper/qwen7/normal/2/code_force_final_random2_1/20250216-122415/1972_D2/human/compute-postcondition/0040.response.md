Output State: `x` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 16, `m` is greater than or equal to 24, `y` is 5, and `cnt` is 3.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`. Given the initial conditions and the output states after the first three iterations, we can deduce the following:

- After the first iteration, `y` becomes 2, and `cnt` is incremented to 1.
- After the second iteration, `y` becomes 3, and `cnt` is incremented to 2.
- After the third iteration, `y` becomes 4, but since `math.gcd(2, 4) != 1`, `cnt` remains 2. However, the loop condition checks the updated values of `n` and `m`, which are now at least 8 and 8 respectively, so it continues.

For the fourth iteration:
- `y` becomes 5.
- We need to check the loop condition with `x = 2` and `y = 5`: `(2 + 5) * 2 = 14` and `(2 + 5) * 5 = 35`. Since `14 <= n` and `35 <= m` must hold, and `math.gcd(2, 5) == 1`, `cnt` is incremented to 3.

After the fourth iteration, the loop would stop because increasing `y` further would violate the conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` given the minimum values of `n` and `m` required for each iteration. Thus, the final state has `y` as 5, `cnt` as 3, and the constraints on `n` and `m` reflect the necessary minimum values to allow the loop to run four times.
