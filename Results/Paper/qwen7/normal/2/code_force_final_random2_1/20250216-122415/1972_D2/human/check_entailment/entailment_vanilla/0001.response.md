Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a single test case.
   - It uses a nested loop where `x` ranges from 1 to \(\sqrt{n}\) and `y` ranges from 1 to a value such that \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
   - For each pair \((x, y)\), it checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). If true, it increments the count by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis

#### Correctness of `func_1`:

1. **Loop Conditions**:
   - The outer loop runs from \(x = 1\) to \(\sqrt{n}\).
   - The inner loop runs from \(y = 1\) to a value ensuring \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).

2. **GCD Check**:
   - The condition \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) ensures that the greatest common divisor of \(x\) and \(y\) is 1, which is necessary for the pair to be valid.

3. **Count Calculation**:
   - The count is incremented by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).
   - This ensures that the product \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where \(x = 1\) and \(y = 1\) correctly because \(\gcd(1, 1) = 1\).

#### Correctness of `func_2`:

- `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case, calling `func_1` for each one.
- This ensures that all test cases are processed correctly.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the functions, we can conclude that the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for each test case. The logic is sound and handles the constraints appropriately.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
