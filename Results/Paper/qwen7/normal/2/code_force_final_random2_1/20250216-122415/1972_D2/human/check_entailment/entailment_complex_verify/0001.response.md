### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program step-by-step to ensure its correctness based on the provided problem description and annotations.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `x` starts from 1 and goes up to \(\sqrt{n}\).
   - `cnt` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the count of valid pairs.

2. **Outer Loop**:
   - The outer loop iterates over possible values of `x` from 1 to \(\sqrt{n}\).

3. **Inner Loop**:
   - The inner loop iterates over possible values of `y` such that \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
   - For each valid pair \((x, y)\), it checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\).
   - If the condition is met, it increments the count by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).

4. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where \(x = 1\) and \(y = 1\) because \(\gcd(1, 1) = 1\).

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Reading Test Cases**:
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case, ensuring that all test cases are processed correctly.

### Detailed Analysis

#### Correctness of `func_1`:

1. **Loop Conditions**:
   - The outer loop runs from \(x = 1\) to \(\sqrt{n}\), ensuring that \(x \times x \leq n\).
   - The inner loop runs from \(y = 1\) to a value ensuring \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).

2. **GCD Check**:
   - The condition \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) ensures that the greatest common divisor of \(x\) and \(y\) is 1, which is necessary for the pair to be valid.

3. **Count Calculation**:
   - The count is incremented by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).
   - This ensures that the product \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where \(x = 1\) and \(y = 1\) correctly because \(\gcd(1, 1) = 1\).

#### Correctness of `func_2`:

- `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case, calling `func_1` for each one.
- This ensures that all test cases are processed correctly.

### Conclusion

After re-analyzing the functions, we can confirm that the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for each test case. The logic is sound and handles the constraints appropriately.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
