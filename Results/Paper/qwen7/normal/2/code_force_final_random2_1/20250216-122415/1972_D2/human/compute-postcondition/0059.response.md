Output State: The value of `cnt` will be the sum of `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` for each iteration where the gcd of `x` and `y` is 1, until the condition `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m` is met. The variable `y` will be incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.

This means that `cnt` will accumulate the minimum values of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for each valid pair of `x` and `y` where their gcd is 1, until the loop's conditions are no longer satisfied.
