Functionality: **The function reads two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \) from the standard input. It then iterates over all pairs of positive integers \( (x, y) \) such that \( x \times x \leq n \) and \( (x + y) \times x \leq n \) and \( (x + y) \times y \leq m \). For each valid pair, if the greatest common divisor of \( x \) and \( y \) is 1, it adds the minimum of \( \frac{n}{(x + y) \times x} \) and \( \frac{m}{(x + y) \times y} \) to a counter. After completing all iterations, it prints the value of the counter, which represents the total count of such valid pairs. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
