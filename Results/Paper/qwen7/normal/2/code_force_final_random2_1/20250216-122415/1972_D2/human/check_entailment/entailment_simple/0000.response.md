Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function correctly initializes variables and reads `n` and `m` as input.
   - It uses a nested loop to iterate through possible values of `x` and `y` up to the square root of `n`.
   - For each pair `(x, y)`, it checks if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` is 1 and if both conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` are satisfied.
   - If these conditions are met, it increments the count `cnt` by the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`.
   - Finally, it prints the count `cnt`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.
   - This ensures that `func_1` is called for each test case as required by the problem statement.

3. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using `func_2` to call `func_1` for each test case.
   - The logic within `func_1` is correct for calculating the number of valid pairs `(a, b)`.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution for the given problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
