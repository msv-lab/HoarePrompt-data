Output State: **`x` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `m` is greater than or equal to 6, `y` is 2, and `cnt` is 1.**

Explanation: Initially, `y` is 1. After executing `y += 1`, `y` becomes 2. The values of `x`, `n`, `m`, and `cnt` remain unchanged because the condition for changing `cnt` (i.e., the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` being 1) is already satisfied before the increment operation. Therefore, `cnt` remains 1.
