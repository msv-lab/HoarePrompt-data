Output State: **`cnt` is increased by `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` if gcd(x, y) is 1; `y` is increased by 1, and \((x + (y + 1)) \times x \leq n\) and \((x + (y + 1)) \times (y + 1) \leq m\)**.

Explanation: The code increments `cnt` by the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`, but only if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` is 1. Additionally, `y` is increased by 1. The conditions \((x + (y + 1)) \times x \leq n\) and \((x + (y + 1)) \times (y + 1) \leq m\) are checked to ensure these constraints are met. All other variables remain in their initial state.
