Reasoning:
- The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy specific conditions.
- The solution consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
- `func_1` is responsible for iterating over possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and checking the conditions.
- `func_2` handles the input/output for multiple test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
- The execution summary correctly describes the behavior of both functions.
- Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in `func_1`, it appears to be correctly addressing the conditions specified in the problem statement.
- Since `func_2` correctly processes the test cases and calls `func_1` for each one, the overall program should work as intended.

Correctness: **True**
