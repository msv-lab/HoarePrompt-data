Output State: **`x` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 6, `cnt` is 8, `y` is 4.**

Explanation: The code `x += 1` increments the value of `x` by 1. Given the initial state where `x` is 1, after executing this line, `x` becomes 2. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `cnt`, and `y`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the updated state includes `x` being 2 while all other variables retain their initial conditions relative to their respective constraints.
