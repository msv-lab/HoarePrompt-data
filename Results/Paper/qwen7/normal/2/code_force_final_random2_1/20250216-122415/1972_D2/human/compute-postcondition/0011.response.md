To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```python
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
- `x` is 1
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 2
- `m` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 2
- `cnt` is 1
- `y` is 2

The loop condition is:
- `(x + y) * x <= n`
- `(x + y) * y <= m`

Substituting the values of `x` and `y`:
- `(1 + 2) * 1 <= n` simplifies to `3 * 1 <= n` or `3 <= n`
- `(1 + 2) * 2 <= m` simplifies to `3 * 2 <= m` or `6 <= m`

For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions must be satisfied:
1. `3 <= n`
2. `6 <= m`

Since `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 and `m` must be greater than or equal to 2 initially, but the specific conditions for the loop are `3 <= n` and `6 <= m`, these are the states that need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `m`.

State: **`x` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `m` must be greater than or equal to 6, `cnt` is 1, `y` is 2**
