### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step using the provided annotations and the problem description.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `x` is initialized to 1.
   - `cnt` is initialized to 0.
   - `n` and `m` are read from the input.

2. **Outer Loop**:
   - The outer loop runs as long as \( x \times x \leq n \).
   - Inside the outer loop, `y` is initialized to 1.

3. **Inner Loop**:
   - The inner loop runs as long as \((x + y) \times x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \times y \leq m\).
   - If \(\text{gcd}(x, y) == 1\), then the program increments `cnt` by the minimum of \(\frac{n}{(x + y) \times x}\) and \(\frac{m}{(x + y) \times y}\).

4. **Termination**:
   - The outer loop increments `x` after each iteration.
   - The inner loop increments `y` until the conditions are no longer satisfied.
   - The program prints `cnt` at the end.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is read from the input, representing the number of test cases.
   
2. **Loop**:
   - The loop runs `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.
   - After processing all test cases, `t` is set to 0 and `_` is set to the last iteration index (which is `t - 1`).

#### Annotations:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
- The program iterates over all possible pairs \((x, y)\) within the given constraints and checks the conditions specified in the problem statement.
- The logic for checking the conditions and updating `cnt` is correct.

#### Correctness Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the constraints \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\) and the sum of all \(n\) and \(m\) values not exceeding \(2 \cdot 10^6\).
- The logic for checking the conditions \((x + y) \times x \leq n\), \((x + y) \times y \leq m\), and \(\text{gcd}(x, y) == 1\) is implemented correctly.
- The program correctly updates `cnt` and prints the result for each test case.

Given the detailed analysis and the annotations, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct and accurately implements the solution for the given problem.
