Output State: **`cnt` is increased by `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` is 1; `y` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `y += 1` increments the value of `y` by 1. The conditions for `cnt` to be increased remain the same: `cnt` is increased by `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` is 1. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
