Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns nothing.**

Given the constraints and relationships, the function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. The description of the output indicates that there are specific conditions related to positive integers `n` and `m`, but these conditions are only mentioned in the context of constraints rather than being part of the function's parameters. Since the function definition provided does not include any parameters, and the output description does not specify a return value or any action to be performed within the function body, the function simply does not perform any operation that would require parameters or return a value.
