### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to ensure its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Loop Conditions**:
   - The outer loop runs from \(x = 1\) to \(\sqrt{n}\).
   - The inner loop runs from \(y = 1\) to a value ensuring \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).

2. **GCD Check**:
   - The condition \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) ensures that the greatest common divisor of \(x\) and \(y\) is 1, which is necessary for the pair to be valid.

3. **Count Calculation**:
   - The count is incremented by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).
   - This ensures that the product \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where \(x = 1\) and \(y = 1\) correctly because \(\gcd(1, 1) = 1\).

#### Function `func_2`:
- `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case, calling `func_1` for each one.
- This ensures that all test cases are processed correctly.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The input handling in `func_1` and `func_2` is correct. They read the necessary inputs and process them as required.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loops in `func_1` are structured to ensure that all possible pairs \((x, y)\) within the given constraints are checked.
   - The conditions \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\) ensure that the pairs are within the bounds specified.

3. **GCD Calculation**:
   - The use of `math.gcd(x, y)` ensures that the greatest common divisor is correctly calculated.

4. **Count Increment**:
   - The count is incremented by the minimum of the two floor divisions, which correctly ensures that the product \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The edge case where \(x = 1\) and \(y = 1\) is handled correctly.

6. **Output**:
   - The output is correctly printed for each test case.

Given the detailed analysis, the program appears to be correct and handles all the necessary conditions and constraints.
