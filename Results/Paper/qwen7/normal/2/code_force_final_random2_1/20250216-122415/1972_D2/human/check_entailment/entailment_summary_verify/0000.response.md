### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summaries step-by-step to validate the original assessment.

#### Problem Description:
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

#### Function Summaries:
- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function processes a single test case and calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).
- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function processes up to \(10^4\) test cases. For each test case, it calls `func_1()`. After processing all test cases, it sets `t` to 0 and `_` to 3. However, this part of the summary seems incorrect as it doesn't align with the actual behavior of the function.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function iterates through possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) using nested loops.
   - For each pair \((x, y)\), it checks if \(x + y\) divides \(x \cdot y \cdot \gcd(x, y)\).
   - If the condition is satisfied, it increments the count by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - It then calls `func_1()` for each test case.
   - After processing all test cases, it sets `t` to 0 and `_` to 3, which is not relevant to the main functionality.

#### Verification:
- The logic in `func_1` seems correct. It iterates through possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) and checks the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).
- The count is incremented appropriately based on the valid pairs found.
- The nested loops ensure that all possible pairs within the given constraints are checked.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to be handling the problem correctly without missing any valid pairs or including invalid ones.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate. The provided program correctly implements the solution for the given problem.
