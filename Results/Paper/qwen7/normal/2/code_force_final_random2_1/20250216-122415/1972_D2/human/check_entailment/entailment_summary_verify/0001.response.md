### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the provided program and the original assessment step by step to ensure its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Loop Conditions**:
   - The outer loop runs from \(x = 1\) to \(\sqrt{n}\).
   - The inner loop runs from \(y = 1\) to a value ensuring \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).

2. **GCD Check**:
   - The condition \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) ensures that the greatest common divisor of \(x\) and \(y\) is 1, which is necessary for the pair to be valid.

3. **Count Calculation**:
   - The count is incremented by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).
   - This ensures that the product \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where \(x = 1\) and \(y = 1\) correctly because \(\gcd(1, 1) = 1\).

#### Function `func_2`:
- `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case, calling `func_1` for each one.
- This ensures that all test cases are processed correctly.

#### Function Summary:
- The summary indicates that `func_2` processes up to \(10^4\) test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
- After processing all test cases, it sets `t` to 0 and `_` to 3. However, this part of the summary seems unrelated to the actual functionality of the functions and might be a side effect of some other part of the code or testing framework.

### Detailed Verification

1. **Loop Conditions**:
   - The outer loop runs from \(x = 1\) to \(\sqrt{n}\) to ensure efficient checking of possible values of \(x\).
   - The inner loop runs from \(y = 1\) to a value ensuring \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\), which is a valid approach to limit the search space.

2. **GCD Check**:
   - The check \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) ensures that the pair \((x, y)\) meets the condition that their GCD is 1, which is necessary for the product \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) to be a multiple of \(a + b\).

3. **Count Calculation**:
   - The count is incremented by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\), which correctly ensures that the product \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where \(x = 1\) and \(y = 1\) because \(\gcd(1, 1) = 1\).

5. **Function `func_2`**:
   - `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case, calling `func_1` for each one.
   - This ensures that all test cases are processed correctly.

### Conclusion

After re-evaluating the functions and the provided code, we can confirm that the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for each test case. The logic is sound and handles the constraints appropriately.
