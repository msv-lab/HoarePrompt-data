Output State: The value of `cnt` will be the sum of `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + ((y-1) + 1) * (y-1)))` for each iteration where the gcd of `x` and `y` is 1, starting from `y = 1` until the condition `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m` is met.

In simpler terms, `cnt` will accumulate the minimum values of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` for each valid pair `(x, y)` where `y` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, as long as both conditions `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m` hold true. The loop will continue to execute as long as these conditions are satisfied, and `cnt` will be updated accordingly.
