To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head:

```
while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The loop will continue to execute as long as both conditions are true:
1. \((x + y) * x \leq n\)
2. \((x + y) * y \leq m\)

Let's analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `cnt` is increased by `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` if gcd(x, y) is 1.
- `y` is increased by 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions in the loop head must still be true. The values of `x` and `y` are the only ones that can change based on the given information, and they directly affect the conditions in the loop head.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition 1**: \((x + y) * x \leq n\)
   - If \(y\) increases by 1, then \(x + y\) increases by 1.
   - Therefore, \((x + y) * x\) will increase.
   - For the condition to remain true, \((x + y) * x\) must still be less than or equal to \(n\).

2. **Condition 2**: \((x + y) * y \leq m\)
   - Similarly, if \(y\) increases by 1, then \(x + y\) increases by 1.
   - Therefore, \((x + y) * y\) will increase.
   - For the condition to remain true, \((x + y) * y\) must still be less than or equal to \(m\).

### Conclusion:

To ensure the loop executes one more time, both conditions must still hold true after incrementing \(y\) by 1. This means that the new value of \(y\) should still satisfy both conditions.

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted is \(y\). Specifically, \(y\) must be such that both conditions in the loop head are still satisfied after the increment.

### Final Answer:
State: **`cnt` is increased by `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` if gcd(x, y) is 1; `y` must be incremented by 1 such that \((x + y) * x \leq n\) and \((x + y) * y \leq m\)**
