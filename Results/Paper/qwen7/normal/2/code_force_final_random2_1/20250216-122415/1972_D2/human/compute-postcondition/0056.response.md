Output State: **`cnt` is increased by `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` if gcd(x, y) is 1; `y` is incremented by 1 such that \((x + y) * x \leq n\) and \((x + y) * y \leq m\)**.

This means that the value of `cnt` is updated by adding the minimum of two values: `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`, provided that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` is 1. Additionally, the value of `y` is incremented by 1, ensuring that the conditions \((x + y) * x \leq n\) and \((x + y) * y \leq m\) are still satisfied. All other variables remain in their initial state relative to the given conditions.
