Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Description:**
   - `i` is `x - 1`.
   - `count` is the total number of times `num` equals 1 during the loop's execution plus 1 if `num` equals 1.
   - `num` is `n - list0[-1]`.
   - The current value of `num` is 1.

2. **Determine the Value of `num`:**
   - According to the initial state, `num` is currently 1.

3. **Determine the Value of `count`:**
   - `count` is the total number of times `num` equals 1 during the loop's execution plus 1 if `num` equals 1.
   - Since the current value of `num` is 1, `count` must be at least 1 (because it includes the current occurrence).

4. **Determine the Value of `i`:**
   - `i` is `x - 1`.

5. **Evaluate the Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(count + x - 2)`.
   - We know `count` is at least 1, and `i` is `x - 1`.
   - Therefore, `count + x - 2` simplifies to `1 + x - 2` (since `count` is at least 1).
   - This further simplifies to `x - 1`.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The value of `x - 1` is printed.

Output: **x - 1**
