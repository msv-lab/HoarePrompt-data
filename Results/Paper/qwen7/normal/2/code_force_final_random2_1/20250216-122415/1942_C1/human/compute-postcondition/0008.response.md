Postcondition: **`count` is 0, `T` is an integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `x` must be greater than 1, `y` is an input integer, `list0` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `num` is the difference between `list0[i + 1]` and `list0[i]` minus 1, and `num` equals 1**.
