You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.
- The cake is a regular polygon with `n` sides.
- Bessie has already chosen `x` vertices.
- We can choose up to `y` additional vertices, but in this version, `y = 0`.
- We need to calculate the maximum number of triangles that can be formed using the chosen vertices.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Choosing Vertices**: The chosen vertices must be used to form triangles.
2. **Non-Intersecting Diagonals**: Triangles should not intersect.
3. **Maximizing Triangles**: We need to maximize the number of triangles formed.

### Analysis of the Given Program:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - `T` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n`, `x`, and `y` are read.
   - `list0` contains the chosen vertices.

2. **Sorting Chosen Vertices**:
   - `list0` is sorted to facilitate the calculation of gaps between consecutive chosen vertices.

3. **Counting Gaps**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted list to count the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices.
   - If the gap is exactly 1, it increments the `count` variable.
   - After the loop, it checks the gap between the last chosen vertex and the total number of vertices (`n`).

4. **Calculating Total Triangles**:
   - The final count of triangles is calculated as `count + x - 2`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Gaps**:
   - The program only counts gaps of exactly 1 between consecutive chosen vertices.
   - This approach does not account for the possibility of forming triangles using larger gaps or the remaining vertices after the last chosen vertex.

2. **Handling Remaining Vertices**:
   - The program does not consider the remaining vertices after the last chosen vertex when calculating the number of triangles.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
- Calculate the number of gaps between chosen vertices.
- Use these gaps to determine how many triangles can be formed.
- Ensure that the remaining vertices after the last chosen vertex are also considered.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly handle the problem constraints and logic. It only counts specific gaps and does not account for the full potential of forming triangles.
