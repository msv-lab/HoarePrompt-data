Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(x - 1)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `x`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < x - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `i` is either 0 or 1.
   - `num` is 0.
   - If `num` equals 1, then `i` becomes 1; otherwise, `i` remains 0.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `num` is currently 0, according to the postcondition, `i` remains 0.
   - The value of `x` is not explicitly given, but it must be such that the loop can potentially execute again. Given that `i` is either 0 or 1, `x` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` remains 0.
   - `x` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 0, `x` must be greater than 1**
