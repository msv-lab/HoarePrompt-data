You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

    #State: Output State: The loop has completed all its iterations, and the final value of `count` is the total number of times `num` equals 1 during the loop's execution plus any additional increments due to `n - list0[-1]` being 1. The variable `T` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 10^4\), `n` is the last element of the sorted list `list0` plus the final value of `num`, and `x` is the total number of iterations the loop executed. The variable `y` remains unchanged, and `list0` is a sorted list of integers as input.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires maximizing the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by choosing vertices and drawing diagonals. However, the program attempts to count the number of gaps between the chosen vertices, which does not necessarily lead to the maximum number of triangles.

For example, consider the following test case:
- \( n = 8 \)
- \( x = 4 \)
- \( y = 0 \)
- Chosen vertices: \( [1, 6, 2, 5] \)

The program's logic will count the gaps between the chosen vertices and the remaining vertices, but it does not account for the optimal way to draw diagonals to maximize the number of triangles. In this case, the correct solution involves drawing diagonals to form triangles, not just counting gaps.

A correct approach would involve calculating the number of triangles that can be formed by considering all possible combinations of vertices and ensuring that the diagonals do not intersect. The given program does not implement this logic, leading to incorrect results for many test cases.
