Output State: **The loop will continue executing until `i` reaches `x-1`. After all iterations, `i` will be `x-1`, `count` will be the total number of times `num` equals 1 during the loop's execution, and `num` will be the value of `list0[x-1+1] - list0[x-1] - 1` if `i` reaches `x-1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `x-1`. The variable `count` will hold the total number of times the condition `num == 1` was met during the loop's execution. The variable `num` will store the value of `list0[x] - list0[x-1] - 1`, where `x` is the final value of `i` (which is `x-1`).
