Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `password` is a string of length between 1 and 20, inclusive, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits; `digits` is an empty list; `letters` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for char in password:
    if char.isdigit():
        digits.append(char)
    else:
        letters.append(char)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `password` is a string of length between 1 and 20, inclusive, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. `char` is the first character of `password`. If the first character is a digit, `digits` is a list containing the first character of `password`. If the first character is a lowercase Latin letter, `letters` is a list with one additional element `char`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `password` is a string of length between 0 and 19 (inclusive), consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `char` is the first character of `password`. If `char` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing the first character of `password`. Otherwise, `letters` is a list containing the first character of `password`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `password` is a string of length between 0 and 19, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `char` is the second character of `password`; if the first character of `password` is a digit, then `digits` is a list containing the first two characters of `password`, otherwise `letters` is a list containing the first two characters of `password`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
