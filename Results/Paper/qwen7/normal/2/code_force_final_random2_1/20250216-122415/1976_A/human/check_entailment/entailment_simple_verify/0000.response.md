### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the annotated code and the logic of the `func_1` function to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Function Logic Breakdown:**
   - The function `func_1` processes the password by separating digits and letters into two lists.
   - It then sorts both lists.
   - It checks if any digit is greater than the next digit (which ensures digits are in non-decreasing order).
   - It also checks if the last digit is greater than any preceding letter (which ensures no digit comes after a letter).

2. **Key Checks:**
   - The first check `if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:` ensures that digits are in non-decreasing order.
   - The second check `if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:` ensures that the last digit is not greater than any preceding letter.

3. **Annotations Explanation:**
   - The annotation states that the function checks if no two consecutive elements in the `digits` list are out of order and if the last element of the `digits` list is not greater than any element in the `letters` list.
   - This means that the function correctly handles the condition that there should be no digit that comes after a letter.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - Consider the password `123abc`: 
     - Digits: `1, 2, 3`
     - Letters: `a, b, c`
     - Sorted Digits: `1, 2, 3`
     - Sorted Letters: `a, b, c`
     - The function will check:
       - `1 <= 2` and `2 <= 3` (digits are in non-decreasing order)
       - `3 <= a` (last digit is not greater than any letter)
     - Both conditions pass, so the function returns `True`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles cases like `123abc`, `abc123`, `123456`, `abcde`, etc.
   - It fails the original assessment's counterexample `123abc` because it correctly identifies that the last digit `3` is not greater than any preceding letter, ensuring the condition is met.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly identified the function as incorrect. The provided function correctly implements the required conditions for a strong password. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
