Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `char`, which is used to iterate over each character in the string `password`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `char`**: Since the loop starts iterating from the first character of `password`, `char` should be set to the first character of `password` before the loop starts.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `password`**: The initial state of `password` is given as a string of length between 1 and 20, inclusive, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. This information does not change within the loop, but it is necessary to know the nature of the string being iterated over.

4. **Adjust the States**: We need to adjust the states such that the loop can start executing correctly. Specifically, `char` should be set to the first character of `password`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `password` remains as a string of length between 1 and 20, inclusive, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
- `char` is set to the first character of `password`.

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`password` is a string of length between 1 and 20, inclusive, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `char` is the first character of `password`**.
