The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop condition is based on the value of `i` being less than `len(digits)`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is an integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(digits) - 1`.

Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was equal to `len(digits) - 1`. In this case, the loop would not execute again because the condition `i < len(digits)` would no longer be satisfied.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and must still be less than `len(digits)`.

State: **`i` is an integer that is less than `len(digits)`**
