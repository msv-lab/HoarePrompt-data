The code `new_median = median` simply assigns the value of `median` to `new_median`. This does not change the values of any other variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`op` is 0, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is sorted version of `a` with each element increased by 3, `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2, `new_median` is `b[ma] + 3`, `median` is `b[ma]`.**
