Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `p` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`.
   - `res` is the count of elements in `a` that are equal to `a[p]`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(res)`.

To determine what will be printed, we need to understand the value of `res`.

- `p` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`. This means `p` is the index of the middle element of the list `a` if `n` is odd, or the index just before the middle if `n` is even.
- `res` is the count of elements in `a` that are equal to `a[p]`. This means `res` will be the number of times the middle element (or the element just before the middle if `n` is even) appears in the list `a`.

Given the initial state, the value of `res` depends on the specific values in the list `a` and the position of `p`. However, without the actual values of `a` and `n`, we can only describe `res` in terms of the list `a` and the index `p`.

Output: **res (where res is the count of elements in list `a` that are equal to `a[(n + 1) // 2 - 1]`)**
