Output State: **`op` is 3, `t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `num` is an input integer, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the input string from the user, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is a sorted version of `a`, `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2, `median` is `b[ma] + 1, `b` is a sorted version of `a` with each element increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `b = sorted(b)` sorts the list `b`. Since each element in `b` was already increased by 1 before sorting, the sorted list `b` remains the same as the original list `a` but with each element increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
