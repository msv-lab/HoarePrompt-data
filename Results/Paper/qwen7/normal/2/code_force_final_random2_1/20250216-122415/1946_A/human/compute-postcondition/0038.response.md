Based on the initial state provided:

- `op` is explicitly stated to be 3.
- `t` is a positive integer but its specific value is not needed for this particular print statement.
- `i` is 0.
- `num` and `num2` are input integers but their values are not relevant for the print statement.
- `case` is an input string from the user.
- `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string.
- `b` is a sorted version of `a` with each element increased by 3.
- `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2.
- `median` is `b[ma] + 3`.
- `new_median` is `b[ma] + 3`.

The loop increments `b[ma]` until `new_median` exceeds `median`. Given that the loop executes 3 times and increments `b[ma]` by 1 each time, `b[ma]` is incremented by 3 in total. Thus, `new_median` and `median` both become `b[ma] + 3`.

The print statement is simply printing the value of `op`, which is 3.

Output: **3**
