Output State: **`op` is 0, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is sorted with each element increased by 3, `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2, `new_median` is `b[ma]`, `median` is `b[ma] + 1`, `b` is explicitly sorted again, `i` is `num`, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the input string, `a` is updated to contain integers from `case` split and filtered.**

Explanation: The code `b = sorted(a)` sorts the list `a` and assigns it to `b`. Since `a` was already filtered and split from the `case` string, sorting it again does not change its content. The other variables remain unchanged as the code only modifies `b` to be explicitly sorted again.
