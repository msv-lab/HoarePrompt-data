Based on the initial state provided:

- `op` is explicitly stated to be 3.
- `a` is a list of integers derived from splitting and filtering the `case` string, but it is not modified within the loop.
- `b` is the sorted version of `a` with each element increased by 3.
- `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2, depending on the value of `num2`.
- `new_median` is `b[ma]`.
- `median` is `b[ma] + 1`.
- `b` is explicitly sorted one last time, but since the elements are already incremented and the list is sorted, this final sort does not change the order.

The `print(op)` statement will simply print the value of `op`, which is explicitly given as 3.

Output: **3**
