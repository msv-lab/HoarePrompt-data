Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array as described in the problem statement. Instead, it counts the occurrences of the element at the median position in the sorted array. This approach is incorrect because simply counting the occurrences of the current median does not guarantee the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
2 2 8
```
The program will output `1` because it counts the occurrences of `2`, which is the current median. However, the correct solution requires increasing the value at the median position to the next possible value, which would result in a median of `3` after one operation. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
