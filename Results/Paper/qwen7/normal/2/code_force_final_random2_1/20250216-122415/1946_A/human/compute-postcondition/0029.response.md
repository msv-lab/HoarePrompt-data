Output State: **`op` is 2, `t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `num` is an input integer, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the input string from the user, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is a sorted version of `a`, `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2, `median` is `b[ma] + 1, new_median` is `b[ma] + 1, `b` is sorted**.

The code `b = sorted(b)` sorts the list `b`. Since `b` was previously a list of integers derived from the filtered `case` string, sorting it does not change its content but ensures it is in ascending order. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
