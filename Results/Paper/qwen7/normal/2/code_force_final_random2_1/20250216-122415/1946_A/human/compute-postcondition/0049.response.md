Output State: **`op` is 0, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is a sorted version of `a` with each element increased by 3, `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2, and `new_median` is `b[ma] + 3`.**

Explanation: The code `b = sorted(a)` sorts the list `a` and assigns the sorted list to `b`. The other variables (`op`, `ma`, and `new_median`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `b` is updated to be the sorted version of `a` with each element increased by 3, which was its previous state.
