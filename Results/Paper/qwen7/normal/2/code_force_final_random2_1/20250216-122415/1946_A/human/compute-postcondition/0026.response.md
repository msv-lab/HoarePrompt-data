Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `new_median <= median`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `op` is 1
   - `t` is a positive integer
   - `i` is 0
   - `num` is an input integer
   - `num2` is an input integer
   - `case` is the input string from the user
   - `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string
   - `b` is a sorted version of `a`
   - `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2
   - `median` is `b[ma] + 1`
   - `new_median` is `b[ma] + 1`

3. **Determine which states need to be adjusted**:
   - The loop condition depends on `new_median` and `median`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `new_median` must be less than or equal to `median`.

Given that `new_median` is currently set to `b[ma] + 1` and `median` is also `b[ma] + 1`, the current values of `new_median` and `median` are the same. Therefore, the loop condition `new_median <= median` is already satisfied.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to change the value of `new_median` such that it becomes less than `median`. This can be done by decrementing `new_median` by 1.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - We need to adjust `new_median` to be one less than `median`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`op` is 1, `t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `num` is an input integer, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the input string from the user, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is a sorted version of `a`, `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2, `median` is `b[ma] + 1, new_median` is `b[ma]`**

This adjustment ensures that `new_median` is less than `median`, allowing the loop to execute one more time.
