Functionality: **The function accepts a single parameter `t`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the length of the array `a`, and `a`, a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9]. The function does not return anything explicitly based on the given information.**

This means the function processes `t` test cases, where each test case involves an array `a` of length `n` containing integers within the specified range. However, the specific operation to be performed on the array is not detailed in the provided information.
