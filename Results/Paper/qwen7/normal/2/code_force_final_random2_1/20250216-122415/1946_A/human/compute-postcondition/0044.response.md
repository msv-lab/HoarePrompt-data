Output State: **`op` is 0, `a` is a list of integers from the split and filtered `case` string, `b` is a sorted version of `a` with each element increased by 3, `ma` is either (`num2` // 2) - 1 or `num2` // 2, and `new_median` is `b[ma] + 3`, `case` is now the input string from the user.**

Explanation: The variable `op` is assigned the value 0, which changes its value from 3 to 0. All other variables remain unchanged with their previous values or expressions.
