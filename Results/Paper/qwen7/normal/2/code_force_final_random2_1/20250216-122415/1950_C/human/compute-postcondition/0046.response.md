Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `day` is 'AM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is the integer part of the input split by `:`, `m` is the integer part of the input split by `:`.**

Explanation: The code `day = 'AM'` simply assigns the string `'AM'` to the variable `day`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `h`, or `m`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for these variables while updating `day` to `'AM'`.
