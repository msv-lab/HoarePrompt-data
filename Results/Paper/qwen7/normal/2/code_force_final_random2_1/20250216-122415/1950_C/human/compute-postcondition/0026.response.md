Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1440, `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `n` must be greater than 1, `h` is the integer part of the input split by ':', `m` is the integer part of the input split by ':'**.

Explanation: The code `h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))` takes user input in the format of `hh:mm`, splits the input by the colon `:`, and converts both parts to integers. These integers are then assigned to `h` and `m`. The values of `t`, `day`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
