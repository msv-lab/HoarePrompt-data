Based on the initial state and the conditions provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440.
- `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM'.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `h` is the integer part of the input split by `:`.
- `m` is the integer part of the input split by `:`.

The conditions for setting `day` and adjusting `h` are:
- If `h` is 0, then `day` is set to 'AM' and `h` is set to 12.
- If `h` is greater than 12, then `day` is set to 'PM' and `h` is adjusted to `h - 12`.
- If `h` is 12 or less, then `day` remains unchanged.

Given these conditions, the print statement `print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)` will format and print the time in 12-hour format along with the AM/PM indicator.

To determine the exact output, we need to consider the possible values of `h` and `m` and how they are formatted. Since `h` and `m` are derived from an input split by `:`, let's assume a valid input like "14:30". Here, `h` would be 14 and `m` would be 30.

- If `h` is 14, it is greater than 12, so `day` is set to 'PM' and `h` is adjusted to `14 - 12 = 2`.
- Therefore, the time becomes "02:30 PM".

So, the print statement will output the formatted time and the AM/PM indicator.

Output: **02:30 PM**
