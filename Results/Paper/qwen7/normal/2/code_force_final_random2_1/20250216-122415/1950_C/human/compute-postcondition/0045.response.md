Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1440, `day` is 'PM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is the integer part of the input split by `:` minus 12, `m` is the integer part of the input split by `:`.**

Explanation: The code simply reassigns the variable `day` to 'PM'. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `h`, and `m`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
