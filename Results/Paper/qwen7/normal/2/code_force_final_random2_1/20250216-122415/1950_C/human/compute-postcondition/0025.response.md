Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is simply `for _ in range(n):`. This means the loop variable `_` is not used within the loop, but the loop itself depends on the value of `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `n` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\)
   - `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM'
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `h` is either the input integer minus 12 if `h` is greater than 12, or 12 if `h` is 0
   - `m` is an input integer

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop variable `_` is not used, the values of `t`, `day`, `h`, and `m` remain unchanged.
   - The only variable that changes is `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be decremented by 1 (since `range(n)` will stop when `n` reaches 0).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `t` remains the same
- `day` remains the same
- `n` is decreased by 1
- `h` remains the same
- `m` remains the same

So, the new state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `n` must be greater than 1, `h` is either the input integer minus 12 if `h` is greater than 12, or 12 if `h` is 0, and `m` is an input integer**
