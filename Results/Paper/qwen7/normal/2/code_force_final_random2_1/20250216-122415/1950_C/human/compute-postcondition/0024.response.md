Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440.
- `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM'.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `h` is either the input integer minus 12 if `h` is greater than 12, or 12 if `h` is 0.
- `m` is an input integer.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

To determine what will be printed, let's break down the components:

1. **`h`**: According to the conditions, `h` is derived from `t`:
   - If `t > 12`, then `h = t - 12`.
   - If `t == 0`, then `h = 12`.

2. **`m`**: This is directly provided as an input integer.

3. **`day`**: This is either 'AM' or 'PM', but the specific value is not provided in the initial state.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement will format `h` and `m` into a time string and append the `day` indicator. Since the exact values of `h`, `m`, and `day` are not specified, we need to express the output in a general form.

Output: **'hh:mm', day** (where `hh` is the value of `h` formatted to two digits, `mm` is the value of `m` formatted to two digits, and `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM')
