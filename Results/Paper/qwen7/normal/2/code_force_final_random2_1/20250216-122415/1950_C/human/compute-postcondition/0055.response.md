Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `n` is the original input integer minus the number of iterations the loop executed, `h` is the integer part of the final input split by `:`, and `m` is the integer part of the final input split by `:`. If `h` is 0, `day` is set to 'AM' and `h` is set to 12. Otherwise, if `h` is greater than 12, then `day` is set to 'PM' and `h` is adjusted to `h - 12`. If `h` is 12 or less, then `day` remains unchanged.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the variables `t`, `day`, and `n` will reflect the final state after processing all inputs. The variable `h` will be adjusted based on the time conversion rules provided within the loop, and `m` will retain the last minute value entered.
