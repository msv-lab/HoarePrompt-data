Output State: **`ans` is `False`, `i` is `m - 4`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such loop or conditional block is specified in the code snippet, we assume it breaks out of the most internal one. The values of `ans`, `i`, and the condition for updating `arr[i - 1]` remain unchanged.
