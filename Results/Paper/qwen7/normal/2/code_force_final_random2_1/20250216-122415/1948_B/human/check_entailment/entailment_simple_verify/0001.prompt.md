You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n such that 2 <= n <= 50, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 0 <= a_i <= 99.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        ans = True
        
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `m` will be 0, `i` will be -1, `arr` will be a list as it was initially, and `ans` will be `False`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `m` and the array elements.
   
2. **Initialization:**
   - An array `arr` is initialized with the input values.
   - A boolean variable `ans` is set to `True`, indicating initially that the array can be sorted.

3. **Checking Sorted Order:**
   - The program iterates from the end of the array to the beginning.
   - For each pair of adjacent elements, it checks if the current element (`arr[i]`) is less than the previous element (`arr[i - 1]`).
   - If a violation of the sorted order is found, the program constructs a new list `nums` by converting the previous element into its digit components and appending the current element.
   - It then checks if `nums` is sorted. If not, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all elements, the program prints "YES" if `ans` is `True`, indicating the array can be sorted, or "NO" if `ans` is `False`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Logic for Checking and Fixing the Array:**
   - The logic for checking and fixing the array is flawed. Specifically, the program attempts to fix the array by splitting the larger number and inserting the digits back into the array. However, this approach does not guarantee that the array will become sorted after the operation.
   - The program only checks if the combined list of digits is sorted but does not ensure that the resulting array is sorted after the operation.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Digits:**
   - The program constructs `nums` by converting the previous element into digits and appending the current element. This does not necessarily result in a sorted array because the digits may not be placed correctly to maintain the sorted order.

3. **Break Statement:**
   - The break statement inside the loop immediately stops further checks once a violation is found, which might prematurely conclude that the array cannot be sorted.

### Conclusion

Given the issues in the logic and handling of the digits, the program does not correctly determine whether the array can be sorted using the specified operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
