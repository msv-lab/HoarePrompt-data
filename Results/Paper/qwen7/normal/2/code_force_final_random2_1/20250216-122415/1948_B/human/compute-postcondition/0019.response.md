Output State: **`m` is at least 1, `i` is `m - 3`, `nums` is a list containing the integer representation of `arr[i-1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `nums` by converting each character of the string `arr[i-1]` into integers and appending the integer value of `arr[i]` to it. The value of `i` is updated to `m - 3` because the initial value of `i` was `m - 2`, and the code increments `i` by 1 when creating the list comprehension. The value of `m` remains unchanged, and the initial value of `i` is adjusted to `m - 3`.
