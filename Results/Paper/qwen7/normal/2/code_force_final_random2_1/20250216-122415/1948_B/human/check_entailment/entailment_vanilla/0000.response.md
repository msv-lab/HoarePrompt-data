Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `m` and the array elements.
   
2. **Initialization:**
   - An array `arr` is initialized with the input values.
   - A boolean variable `ans` is set to `True`, indicating initially that the array can be sorted.

3. **Checking Sorted Order:**
   - The program iterates from the end of the array to the beginning.
   - For each pair of adjacent elements, it checks if the current element (`arr[i]`) is less than the previous element (`arr[i - 1]`).
   - If a violation of the sorted order is found, the program constructs a new list `nums` by converting the previous element into its digit components and appending the current element.
   - It then checks if `nums` is sorted. If not, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all elements, the program prints "YES" if `ans` is `True`, indicating the array can be sorted, or "NO" if `ans` is `False`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Logic for Checking and Fixing the Array:**
   - The logic for checking and fixing the array is flawed. Specifically, the program attempts to fix the array by splitting the larger number and inserting the digits back into the array. However, this approach does not guarantee that the array will become sorted after the operation.
   - The program only checks if the combined list of digits is sorted but does not ensure that the resulting array is sorted after the operation.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Digits:**
   - The program constructs `nums` by converting the previous element into digits and appending the current element. This does not necessarily result in a sorted array because the digits may not be placed correctly to maintain the sorted order.

3. **Break Statement:**
   - The break statement inside the loop immediately stops further checks once a violation is found, which might prematurely conclude that the array cannot be sorted.

### Conclusion

Given the issues in the logic and handling of the digits, the program does not correctly determine whether the array can be sorted using the specified operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
