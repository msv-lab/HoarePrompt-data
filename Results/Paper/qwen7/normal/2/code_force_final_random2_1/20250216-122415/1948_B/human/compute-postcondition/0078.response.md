Output State: **`m` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers created from user input, and `ans` is True.**

The code sets the variable `ans` to `True`. This changes the value of `ans` from `False` to `True`. The other variables (`m`, `i`, and `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
