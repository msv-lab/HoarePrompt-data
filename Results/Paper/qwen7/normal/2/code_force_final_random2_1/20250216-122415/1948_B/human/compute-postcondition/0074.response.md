Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `i` is 0.
- `arr` is updated such that each element (except the last one) is replaced by the most significant digit of the next element in the original array.
- `ans` is False.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
```

Here, `ans` is explicitly stated to be `False`. In Python, the expression `['NO', 'YES'][ans]` will select the element at the index specified by `ans`. Since `ans` is `False`, which corresponds to the index `0` in Python (as `False` is treated as `0` in indexing), the code will print the first element of the list `['NO', 'YES']`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **NO**
