### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself. This part is handled correctly.

2. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The program iterates through the array from the end to the beginning (`for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1)`).
   - It checks if the current element `arr[i]` is less than the previous element `arr[i - 1]`.
   - If it finds such a pair, it converts `arr[i - 1]` into its digit representation and checks if merging these digits results in a sorted sequence.
   - If the sequence after merging is not sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - Finally, it prints "YES" if `ans` is `True` and "NO" if `ans` is `False`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The logic handles the case where the array is already sorted correctly.
   - The logic also handles the case where an element can be split into digits and merged back to check if it helps in sorting the array.
   - However, the state comment at the end suggests that `m` will be 0 and `i` will be -1 after the loop, which is correct because `m` is the value of `n` and `i` is decremented until it reaches -1.

4. **Output**:
   - The output is correctly formatted as "YES" or "NO" based on the value of `ans`.

### Conclusion:

The program logic is correct and handles the problem statement accurately. There are no logical errors or missing parts in the code.

### Correctness:
**True**
