Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `m` is at least 1.
   - `i` is `m - 1`.
   - If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then:
     - The current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `nums[0]`.
     - `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.
     - If `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken.
     - Otherwise, no change to the variables.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
   ```

3. **Adjusting States:**
   - The loop starts from `i = m - 1` and decrements `i` by 1 until `i` is greater than 0.
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `m - 2`.

4. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i > 0`.

5. **Variables Involved in the Loop Head:**
   - `i`
   - `m`

6. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since `i` is decremented by 1, `i` will become `m - 2`.
   - `m` remains unchanged unless there is an external condition that changes it (which is not mentioned here).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`m` is at least 1, `i` is `m - 2`**.
