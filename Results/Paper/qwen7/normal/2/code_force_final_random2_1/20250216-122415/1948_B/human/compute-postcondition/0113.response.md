Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes input through multiple lines. It first reads an integer n where 2 <= n <= 50, then reads n integers each between 0 and 99. The function returns a value based on the processed data.**

This means the function does not take any direct parameters but expects input in a specific format across multiple lines. It reads an integer `n` followed by `n` integers, and based on this input, it produces some output.
