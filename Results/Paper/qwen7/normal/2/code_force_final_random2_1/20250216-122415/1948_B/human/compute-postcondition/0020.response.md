Output State: **`m` is at least 1, `i` is `m - 3`, `nums` is a list containing the integer representation of `arr[i-1]` followed by `arr[i]`, `ans` is `False`**.

The code initializes the variable `ans` to `False`. This assignment does not affect the values of `m`, `i`, or `nums`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
