Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `arr[i - 1]` is updated to the integer representation of the last element of `arr`, `ans` is False, and `nums` is a list containing the integer representation of the last element of `arr` followed by the value of `arr[i]` with `arr[i - 1]` updated.**

Explanation: The code updates `arr[i - 1]` to the value of `nums[0]`. Since `i` is 0, `arr[i - 1]` refers to `arr[-1]`, which is the last element of `arr`. The other variables (`m`, `i`, `ans`, and `nums`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `arr[i - 1]` is now the integer representation of the last element of `arr`, and `nums` remains as a list containing the integer representation of the last element of `arr` followed by the value of `arr[i]` (which is the first element of `arr` since `i` is 0).
