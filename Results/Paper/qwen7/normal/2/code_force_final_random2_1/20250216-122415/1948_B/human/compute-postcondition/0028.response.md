Output State: **`m` is at least 1, `i` is `m - 4`, `arr[i - 1]` is updated to either `arr[i]` if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is true, or remains unchanged if the condition is false, and `ans` is `False`; `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**

Explanation:
- The code creates a list `nums` by converting the digits of `arr[i - 1]` into integers and appending `arr[i]` to it.
- The values of `m`, `i`, `arr`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial state.
- `nums` is now a list that includes the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by the value of `arr[i]`.
