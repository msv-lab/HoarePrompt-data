Output State: **`m` is at least 1, `i` is `m - 4`, `arr[i - 1]` is now `nums[0]`, `ans` is `False`, and `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `nums[0]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `arr[i - 1]` to `nums[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `nums` is updated to include the new value of `arr[i - 1]` (which is now `nums[0]`) following the previous value of `arr[i]`.
