Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `arr[i]` is the previous value of `arr[i-1]` converted to an integer and appended to the list `[arr[i]]`, and `nums` is a list containing the digits of the previous value of `arr[i-1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**

Explanation: The code converts the string representation of `arr[i-1]` into a list of integers using a list comprehension and appends `arr[i]` to it. Since `arr[i]` was previously less than `arr[i-1]`, and now it is part of a list with its digits, the condition that `m` must be greater than or equal to 2 remains unchanged. The value of `i` also remains unchanged.
