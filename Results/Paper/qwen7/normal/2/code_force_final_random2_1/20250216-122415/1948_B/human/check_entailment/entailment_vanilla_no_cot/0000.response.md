Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The main issues are:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Checking Sorted Order**: The program checks if `arr[i-1]` and `arr[i]` can be made equal after splitting and sorting the digits of `arr[i-1]`. However, this approach is flawed because it doesn't consider the possibility of making the entire array sorted through multiple operations.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Operations**: The program only checks if the current pair `(arr[i-1], arr[i])` can be made sorted by splitting `arr[i-1]` and comparing the result with `arr[i]`. It should instead focus on whether the entire array can be transformed into a sorted array through multiple operations.

3. **No Transformation Logic**: The program does not actually perform the transformation operations to see if the array can be sorted. Instead, it just checks if a single pair can be made sorted, which is insufficient.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to simulate the operations and check if the array can be transformed into a sorted array. Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def can_sort_array(arr):
    while True:
        changed = False
        for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
            if arr[i] > arr[i + 1]:
                # Perform the operation to split arr[i]
                split_arr = [int(digit) for digit in str(arr[i])]
                arr[i] = split_arr[0]
                arr[i + 1:i + 1] = split_arr[1:]
                changed = True
                break
        if not changed:
            break
    return arr == sorted(arr)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if can_sort_array(arr):
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

func()
```

This solution simulates the operations until no more changes can be made and checks if the resulting array is sorted.
