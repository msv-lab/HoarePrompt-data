Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The problem states that `i` is initially 1.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. The loop starts with `i = m - 1` and decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` becomes 0.

4. **Analyze the initial value of `m`**:
   - If `m` is 1, then `i` would start at 0, and the loop would not execute because `range(0, 0, -1)` is empty.
   - If `m` is greater than 1, then `i` would start at `m - 1`, and the loop would execute.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is initially 1, we know that `m` must be at least 2 for the loop to start executing (because `i` starts at `m - 1` and must be greater than or equal to 0).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `m` is at least 2 and `i` is 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`m` must be at least 2, `i` is 1**
