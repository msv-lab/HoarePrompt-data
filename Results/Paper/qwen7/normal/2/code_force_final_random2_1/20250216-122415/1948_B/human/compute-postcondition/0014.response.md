Postcondition: `m` is at least 1, `i` is `m - 1`, and the current value of `arr[i]` is less than the value of `arr[i - 1]`; `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`; if `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, no change to the variables.
