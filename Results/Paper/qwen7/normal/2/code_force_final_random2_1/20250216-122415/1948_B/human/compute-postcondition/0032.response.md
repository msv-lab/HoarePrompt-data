Postcondition: `m` is at least 1, `i` is `m - 4`, `arr[i - 1]` is updated to `arr[i]` if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is true, otherwise it remains unchanged, `ans` is `False`, and `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`. If `nums` is not sorted, the loop breaks; otherwise, the loop continues as normal.
