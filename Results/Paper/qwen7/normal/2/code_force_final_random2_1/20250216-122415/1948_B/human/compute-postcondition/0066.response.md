Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `arr[i - 1]` is updated to the integer representation of the last element of `arr`, `ans` is False, `nums` is a list containing the integer representation of the last element of `arr` followed by the value of `arr[i]`**.

Explanation: The line `ans = False` simply assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `ans`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `m`, `i`, `arr[i - 1]`, and `nums` remain unchanged from their initial states.
