Reasoning:
- The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the logic to check if the array can be made sorted in non-descending order by splitting elements is flawed.
- The program attempts to reverse-check the array by comparing the last digit of consecutive elements and checking if the digits form a non-decreasing sequence when reversed. However, this approach does not accurately reflect the allowed operations (splitting an element into its digits and inserting them in place).
- The correct approach should involve attempting to transform the array by repeatedly splitting elements that are greater than or equal to 10 and checking if the resulting array can be sorted.
- The current implementation does not simulate the actual process of splitting and reinserting digits, and thus cannot correctly determine if the array can be sorted according to the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
