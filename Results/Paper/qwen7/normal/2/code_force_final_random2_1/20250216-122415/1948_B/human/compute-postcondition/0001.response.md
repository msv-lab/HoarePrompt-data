Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(n):`. The only variable involved here is `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. Since the loop runs `n` times, `n` must be a positive integer.

3. **Consider the given state before the loop starts**: We are given that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), and `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\).

4. **Adjust the state**: To ensure the loop can execute, `n` must be within its valid range (i.e., \(2 \leq n \leq 50\)). The value of `t` does not affect the loop's execution condition directly.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `n` must be within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 50\).

**State:**
**`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 50\)**
