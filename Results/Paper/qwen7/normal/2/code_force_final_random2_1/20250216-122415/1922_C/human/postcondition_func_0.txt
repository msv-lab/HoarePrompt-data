The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer n, a strictly increasing list a of n non-negative integers, and an integer m representing the number of queries. It then handles m queries, where each query consists of two distinct integers x and y. Based on these inputs, the function calculates and prints the result for each query according to specific conditions. After processing all queries for a test case, the function moves on to the next test case until all test cases are processed.
