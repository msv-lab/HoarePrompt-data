Output State: **`v` is `y - x`, `t` is `t - 4`, `a` has at least 5 elements, `b` is `[0, 0, b[-2] + v, b[-1] + v, b[-2] + v + (v > x - w) * (b[-2] + v), b[-1] + v + (v > z - y) * (b[-1] + v), b[-2] + v + (v > x - w) * (b[-2] + v + (v > x - w) * (b[-2] + v))], c` is a new variable, `d` is a new variable, `u` is false**

Explanation: The variable `u` is decremented by 1. Since `u` was initially `true`, after the operation `u -= 1`, `u` becomes `false`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
