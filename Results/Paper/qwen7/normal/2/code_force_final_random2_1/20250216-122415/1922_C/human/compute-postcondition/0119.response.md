The only variable in the loop head is `u`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `u`. If `u` is `True`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `u` is `False`. Therefore, to allow the loop to execute one more time, `u` needs to be set to `True`.

State: **`u` is True, `c` is the first return value from function `r()`, `d` is the second return value from function `r()`**
