Given the initial state:
- `u` is `False`
- `c` is the first return value from function `r()`
- `d` is the second return value from function `r()`

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement:
```python
print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `c` and `d` are the return values from the function `r()`. Since no specific values are provided for `r()`, we cannot determine the exact values of `c` and `d`. However, we can express the printed value in terms of these variables.

Let's break down the expression inside the print statement:
1. `(d - 1) * 2` calculates the index for the list `b`.
2. `(c - 1) * 2` calculates another index for the list `b`.

The expression `b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2]` subtracts the element at the index `(c - 1) * 2` from the element at the index `(d - 1) * 2` in the list `b`.

Since the exact values of `c` and `d` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical result. However, we can describe the printed value in terms of the indices and the list `b`.

Output: **b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2]**
