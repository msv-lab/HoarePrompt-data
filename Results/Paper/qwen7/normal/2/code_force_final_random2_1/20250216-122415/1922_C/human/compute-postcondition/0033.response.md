Output State: **`u` is at least 0; `c` is the first return value of `r()`, `d` is the second return value of `r()`**

Explanation: The code `c, d = r()` assigns the return values of the function `r()` to the variables `c` and `d`. Since the initial state only specifies that `u` is at least 0, and no other changes are made to `u`, its state remains unchanged. The values of `c` and `d` are set to the respective return values of the function `r()`.
