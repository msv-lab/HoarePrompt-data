Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` has gone through all its elements in sets of four, with `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` representing the current quartet of consecutive elements from `a`. The variable `v` calculates the difference between `y` and `x`, and `b` is updated based on whether `v` is greater than the differences `x - w` and `z - y`. The value of `u` is assigned the result of `r()`.
Code of the loop:
while u:
    u -= 1
    c, d = r()
    if c < d:
        print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
    else:
        print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `u` is the value of `u` decreased by 1, `c` is the return value of `r()`, and `d` is the second return value of `r()`. If `c` is less than `d`, the function does not change any additional variables. If `c` is greater than or equal to `d`, the function does not change any additional variables either.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `u` is at least 0; `c` is the first return value of `r()`, `d` is the second return value of `r()`. Regardless of whether `c` is less than `d`, the values of `u`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged after the if-else block executes.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `u` is `u - 1`; `c` and `d` are return values from `r()`


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
