The loop condition is `while t`, which means the loop continues as long as `t` is truthy (non-zero). Since the loop will continue to execute until `u` becomes 0, and `t` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to ensure that `t` is non-zero for the loop to execute one more time.

Given that `u` will become 0 after all iterations and `c` and `d` will be the return values from the last call to `r()`, these states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure it is non-zero.

State: **`t` must be non-zero**
