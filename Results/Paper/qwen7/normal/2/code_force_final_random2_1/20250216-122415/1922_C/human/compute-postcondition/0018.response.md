Output State: `a` must have at least 10004 elements, `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` are the next set of consecutive elements from `a`, `v` is equal to `y - x`, `b` is updated to include `b[-2] + v * (v > x - w) + b[-1] + v * (v > z - y)` for each iteration until the end of the loop.

In this final state, `a` will have gone through all its elements in sets of four, with `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` representing the current quartet of consecutive elements from `a`. The variable `v` calculates the difference between `y` and `x`, and `b` is updated based on whether `v` is greater than the differences `x - w` and `z - y`. This process repeats until all possible quartets in `a` have been processed.
