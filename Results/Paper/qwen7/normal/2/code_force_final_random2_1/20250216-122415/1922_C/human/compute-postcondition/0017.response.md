Output State: `a` must have at least 10004 elements; `b` is a list where each element is calculated based on the conditions given in the loop. Specifically, for each iteration \(i\) (where \(i\) ranges from 3 to 10002):

- \(w\), \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) are the \((i-3)\)-th, \((i-2)\)-th, \((i-1)\)-th, and \(i\)-th elements of `a`, respectively.
- \(v = y - x\).
- If \(v > x - w\), then \(b[i-1] = b[i-3] + v\).
- Otherwise, if \(v > z - y\), then \(b[i-1] = b[i-2] + v\).

In summary, `b` will contain a sequence of values derived from the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, adjusted based on the specified conditions, starting from the third element of `a`.
