Output State: **`v` is `y - x`, `t` is `t - 2`, `a` must have at least 5 elements, `b` is `[0, 0, b[-2] + v, b[-1] + v, b[-2] + v + (v > x - w) * (b[-2] + v), b[-1] + v + (v > z - y) * (b[-1] + v)]`.**

Explanation:
- `v` remains `y - x`.
- `t` remains `t - 2`.
- `a` must have at least 5 elements, which is unchanged.
- `b` is updated according to the given code. The new elements added to `b` are `b[-2] + v + (v > x - w) * (b[-2] + v)` and `b[-1] + v + (v > z - y) * (b[-1] + v)`. This means the list `b` now contains `[0, 0, b[-2] + v, b[-1] + v, b[-2] + v + (v > x - w) * (b[-2] + v), b[-1] + v + (v > z - y) * (b[-1] + v)]`.
