Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list with at least 7 elements; `b` is updated based on the values of `v` (which is `y - x`) and the conditions `v > x - w` and `v > z - y` for each iteration; `w` is the next element in `a`, `x` is the element following `w` in `a`, `y` is the element following `x` in `a`, `z` is the element following `y` in `a`, `v` is `y - x` for each iteration; `u` is `True` since `u, = r()` sets `u` to the result of `r()`.
Code of the loop:
while u:
    u -= 1
    c, d = r()
    if c < d:
        print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
    else:
        print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a` is a list with at least 7 elements, `u` is `False`, `c` is the first return value from function `r()`, `d` is the second return value from function `r()`. If `c` is less than `d`, then no changes are made. If `c` is greater than or equal to `d`, then no changes are made either.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `u` is False, `c` is the first return value from function `r()`, `d` is the second return value from function `r()`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `u` is False, `c` is the first return value from function `r()`, `d` is the second return value from function `r()`. Since the if condition `c < d` does not change the values of `u`, `c`, and `d`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
