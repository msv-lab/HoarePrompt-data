Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`tt`) and processes each test case by reading the board dimensions and initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips.
2. **Game Logic**:
   - The program checks if Bob's initial row position (`x2`) is less than or equal to Alice's initial row position (`x1`). If so, it directly prints "Draw".
   - It then checks if the vertical distance between the two players' initial positions is odd. If it is, it further checks if the horizontal positions are the same. If they are, it prints "Alice" because Alice can always force a win by moving diagonally.
   - The program then adjusts the positions of Alice and Bob to simulate their moves, ensuring the new positions are within the board boundaries.
   - It checks if Alice can force a win by ensuring certain conditions are met (e.g., `b // 2 > a` and `abs(x2 - c) >= x1 + c`).
   - If Alice cannot force a win, it prints "Draw".
   - If the vertical distance is even, similar logic is applied but for Bob instead of Alice.
3. **Output**: The program prints "Alice", "Bob", or "Draw" based on the game logic, which matches the expected behavior described in the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the game logic and handles all the specified conditions accurately.

Correctness: **True**
