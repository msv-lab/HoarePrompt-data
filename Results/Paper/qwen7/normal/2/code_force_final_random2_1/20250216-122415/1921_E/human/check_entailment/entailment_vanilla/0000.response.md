Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input for each test case, extracting the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips.
2. **Initial Position Check**: The program checks if Bob's initial position is below or equal to Alice's initial position. If it is, the game immediately results in a draw, which is correct.
3. **Odd Distance Check**: The program checks if the vertical distance between Alice and Bob is odd. If it is, Alice can always force a win by moving diagonally to match Bob's horizontal position, ensuring she can eventually capture Bob's chip.
4. **Even Distance Check**: If the vertical distance is even, the program checks if Alice can force a win by moving to a position where she can capture Bob's chip. This involves complex logic to ensure Alice can make the necessary moves without going out of bounds.
5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when Alice or Bob reaches the boundary of the board, which correctly results in a draw.

Given the detailed analysis, the program appears to handle all the rules and conditions specified in the problem statement accurately.

Correctness: **True**
