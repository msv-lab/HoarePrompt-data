Based on the initial state provided, let's break down the variables and their relationships:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is `r[0]`.
- `m` is `r[1]`.
- `x1` is `r[2] + 1 + a`.
- `x2` is `r[4] - a`.
- `y1` is either `r[3] + 1` or `r[3] - 1`.
- `y2` is either `1` or `m`.
- `x2` is greater than `x1`.
- The difference between `x2` and `x1` is odd.
- `y1` is not equal to `y2`.

Given these conditions, the print statement `print('draw')` will execute and print the string `'draw'`.

Output: **draw**
