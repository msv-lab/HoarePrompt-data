Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are elements of the list `r` where `n = r[0]`, `m = r[1]`, `x1 = r[2]`, `y1 = r[3]`, `x2 = r[4]`, and `y2 = r[5]`.
- `x2` is greater than `x1`.
- The difference between `x2` and `x1` is odd.
- `y1` is equal to `y2`.

The `print` statement in question is simply printing the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
