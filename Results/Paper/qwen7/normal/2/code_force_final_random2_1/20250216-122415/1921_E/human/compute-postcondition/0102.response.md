Output State: **`t` is abs(y2 - y1), `n` is r[0], `m` is r[2], `x1` is x1 + a, `y1` is r[2], `x2` is x2 - a, `y2` is r[4], `a` is either y1 - 1 if y2 < y1, or m - y1 if y2 >= y1, `b` is x2 - x1, and (x2 > x1 and x1 >= 1 and x2 <= n)**.

Explanation: The code `y1 = m` updates the value of `y1` to be equal to `m`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The conditions and relationships involving these variables are preserved, except for the fact that `y1` is now `m`.
