Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is r[0], `m` is r[1], `x1` is r[2] + 1 + a, `y1` is either r[3] + 1 or r[3] - 1, `x2` is r[4] - a, `y2` is m, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is odd, and `y1` is not equal to `y2`. `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`. `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is at least 1, and `x2` is not greater than `n`. `y2` is greater than `y1`; `y1` is increased by `a`.**

In this output state, the variable `y1` has been updated by adding `a` to its original value. All other conditions and relationships among the variables remain unchanged.
