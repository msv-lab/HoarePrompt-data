Postcondition: `t` is an integer, `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is either `r[1]` or `r[2]`, `x1` is `x1 + a`, `y1` is either `1` or `r[2]`, `x2` is `x2 - a`, `y2` is either `r[5] - a` or `y2 + a`, `a` is either `y1 - 1` if `y2 >= y1`, or `m - y1` if `y2 < y1`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, and `(x2 > x1 and x1 >= 1 and x2 <= n)`; `c` is either `y2 - 1` or `m - y2`.

This means that after executing the if-else block, `t` remains as the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, `n` stays as `r[0]`, and `m` changes to either `r[1]` or `r[2]` depending on the condition. The coordinates `x1` and `x2` are adjusted by `a`, and `y1` and `y2` are updated according to the condition. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are determined based on the relationship between `y1` and `y2`.
