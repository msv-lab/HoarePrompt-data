Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is r[0], `m` is r[1], `x1` is r[2] + 1 + a, `y1` is either r[3] + 1 or r[3] - 1, `x2` is r[4], `y2` is r[5], `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is odd, and `y1` is not equal to `y2`. `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.**

Explanation: The value of `x1` is incremented by `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The conditions involving `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, and `y2` still hold true as specified.
