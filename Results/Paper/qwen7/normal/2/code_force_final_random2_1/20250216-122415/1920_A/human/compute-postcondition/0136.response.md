Output State: **`no` is now `[a]`, `num` is 0, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, and `x` is not equal to 2.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` to the list `no`. Since `a` is an input integer, the list `no` is updated to include `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
