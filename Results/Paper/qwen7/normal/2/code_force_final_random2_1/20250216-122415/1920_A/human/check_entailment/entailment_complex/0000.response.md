Reasoning:
1. The program correctly separates the constraints into three lists: `big`, `less`, and `no`.
2. It calculates the potential range of values for `k` by finding the difference between the minimum value in the `less` list and the maximum value in the `big` list.
3. It then adjusts this range by subtracting one for each value in the `no` list that falls within the calculated range.
4. The logic for calculating the range and adjusting it for overlapping values in the `no` list is correct.
5. The program handles the edge case where the calculated range is less than 1 by printing 0.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the function appears to be correct. The program processes each test case as described and computes the correct number of integers `k` that satisfy all constraints.

Correctness: **True**
