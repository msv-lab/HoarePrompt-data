Output State: **`innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable2` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `no` is a list containing the value of `a`.**

Explanation: The line `no.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `no`. Since `a` is an input integer, `no` now contains the value of `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
