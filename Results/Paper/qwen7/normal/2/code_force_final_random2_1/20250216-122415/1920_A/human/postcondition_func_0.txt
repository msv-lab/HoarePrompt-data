The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a series of constraints. For each test case, it separates the constraints into three lists based on their types (big, less, no). It then calculates the difference between the minimum value in the 'less' list and the maximum value in the 'big' list, adjusting this difference by subtracting one for each value in the 'no' list that falls within the calculated range. Finally, it prints the adjusted difference for each test case.
