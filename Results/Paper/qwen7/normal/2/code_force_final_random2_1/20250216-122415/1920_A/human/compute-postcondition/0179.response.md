Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns nothing.**

Given the constraints and relationships provided, the function does not accept any parameters. Instead, it seems to handle a series of test cases internally, where each test case involves an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and another integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), followed by `n` lines of constraints. Each constraint line contains two integers `a` and `x` with specific conditions. However, the problem statement does not specify what the function should return or do with this information, only how the input is structured. Therefore, based on the given information, the function does not return anything.
