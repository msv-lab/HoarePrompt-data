Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `no`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `no`, assigning each element to `i` in turn.

3. **Analyze the postcondition**: The postcondition states that if `i` was within the range defined by the minimum value in `less` and the maximum value in `big`, then `i` is one less than its original value. Otherwise, `i` remains unchanged. The variables `no`, `less`, and `big` remain unchanged.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is assigned a new value from the list `no` at the start of each iteration, the value of `i` changes with each iteration.
   - The values of `no`, `less`, and `big` remain unchanged throughout the loop.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will take the next value from the list `no`.
   - `no`, `less`, and `big` remain unchanged.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is the next value from the list `no`, `no` remains unchanged, `less` remains unchanged, `big` remains unchanged**.
