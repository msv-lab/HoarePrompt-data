Output State: **`no` is a list, `less` is either an empty list or contains the value 2, `num` is 0, `big` is an empty list, `x` is an input integer converted to an integer, `a` is an input integer converted to an integer, `iterable2` is increased by 1**

Explanation: The code uses `map(int, input().split())` to take two space-separated integers as input and convert them to integers, assigning them to `x` and `a`. The other variables (`no`, `less`, `num`, `big`, `iterable2`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
