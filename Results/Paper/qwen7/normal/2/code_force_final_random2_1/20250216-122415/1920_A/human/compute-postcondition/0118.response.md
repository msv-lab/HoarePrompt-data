Postcondition: `no` is a non-empty list with the first element removed, `i` is the second element of the updated `no`, `num` is decremented by 1, and if `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in the `less` list and greater than or equal to the maximum value in the `big` list, the condition holds true as per the if part.
