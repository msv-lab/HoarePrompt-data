Postcondition: `no` is a non-empty list, and the first element `i` of `no` is either `i - 1` and satisfies being less than or equal to the minimum value in the `less` list and greater than or equal to the maximum value in the `big` list, or `i` remains unchanged as the next element of `no`; `num` is decremented by 1.
