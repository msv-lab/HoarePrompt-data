Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `innerLoop` will be equal to the total number of times the loop has run, `iterable2` will be one less than `innerLoop` since it starts from 0, `x` and `a` will be the last pair of integers entered by the user during the final iteration of the loop, and the lists `big`, `less`, and `no` will contain all the values of `a` that correspond to `x` being 1, 2, and any other value respectively throughout all iterations.

In more detail:
- `innerLoop` will hold the total number of iterations the loop ran.
- `iterable2` will be `innerLoop - 1`.
- `x` and `a` will be the values provided in the last iteration of the loop.
- `big` will contain all the values of `a` where `x` was 1.
- `less` will contain all the values of `a` where `x` was 2.
- `no` will contain all the values of `a` where `x` was neither 1 nor 2.
