Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in no`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `no`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in the list `no`. After each iteration, `i` takes the next element from the list `no`.

3. **Postcondition Analysis**: The postcondition states that `no` must contain at least one element, and `i` is the next element in the list `no`. Additionally, if `i` is within certain bounds (less than or equal to the minimum value in the `less` list and greater than or equal to the maximum value in the `big` list), then `num` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `num` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `no` contains at least one element, for the loop to execute one more time, `no` must still contain at least one element.
   - After the current iteration, `i` is the next element in the list `no`. For the next iteration, `i` will be the element after `i` in the list `no`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `no` must still contain at least one element.
   - `i` will be the next element in the list `no`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`no` must contain at least one element, `i` is the next element in the list `no`**.
