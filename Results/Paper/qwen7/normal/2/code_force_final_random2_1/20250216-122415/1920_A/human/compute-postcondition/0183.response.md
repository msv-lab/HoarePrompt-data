Postcondition: `n` is greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` was 2 during the loop iterations, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` was 1 during the loop iterations, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values where `a` was neither 1 nor 2 during the loop iterations. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, `0` is appended to the list `r`. Otherwise, `bx` is less than `ax`, `cx` is non-empty, `tmp` is 3, and the value of `r` is `(ax - bx + 1 - 3)`.
