Output State: **`no` is a non-empty list, `i` is `i - 1`, the value of `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in the `less` list and greater than or equal to the maximum value in the `big` list.**

Explanation: The code `num -= 1` decrements the value of `i` by 1. Since the initial state specifies that `i` is the first element of `no` and its value is less than or equal to the minimum value in the `less` list and greater than or equal to the maximum value in the `big` list, after decrementing `i` by 1, `i` becomes `i - 1`. All other conditions and the list `no` remain unchanged.
