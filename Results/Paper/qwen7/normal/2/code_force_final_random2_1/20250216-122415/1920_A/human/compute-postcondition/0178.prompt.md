Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `loop` is an input integer
Code of the loop:
for iterable in range(loop):
    less = []
    big = []
    no = []
    num = 0
    innerLoop = int(input())
    for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
        x, a = map(int, input().split())
        if x == 1:
            big.append(a)
        elif x == 2:
            less.append(a)
        else:
            no.append(a)
    num = min(less) - max(big) + 1
    if num < 1:
        print(0)
        continue
    for i in no:
        if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):
            num -= 1
    print(num)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations of the loop, `no` will be an empty list, and `num` will be the final value it reaches after all possible decrements based on the conditions given.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The list `no` is empty, `num` is less than or equal to its initial value minus the number of iterations (which is the length of the original `no` list), and `big` and `less` lists remain unchanged from their initial states.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: All elements in the list `no` have been iterated over, and the variable `num` has been decremented by 1 for each element `i` in `no` that satisfies the condition `i <= min(less) and i >= max(big)`. The lists `less` and `big` remain unchanged, as do the values of `iterable2`, `x`, and `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
