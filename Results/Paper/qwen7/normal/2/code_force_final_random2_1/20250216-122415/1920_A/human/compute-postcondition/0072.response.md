Output State: **`no` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `big` is an empty list, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer.**

The code `x, a = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `x` and `a`. The other variables (`no`, `less`, `num`, `big`, and `innerLoop`) remain unchanged.
