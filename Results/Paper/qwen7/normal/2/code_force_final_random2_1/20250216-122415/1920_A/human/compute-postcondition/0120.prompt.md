Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `no` is a list that may contain multiple integers based on the input where `x` is neither 1 nor 2, `less` is either an empty list or contains the value 2 based on the inputs where `x` is 2, `num` is equal to `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `big` is a list that may contain multiple integers based on the input where `x` is 1, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop` since it is incremented in each iteration of the loop, and if `num` is less than 1, the loop continues or the block of code is executed.
Code of the loop:
for i in no:
    if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):
        num -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `no` is a non-empty list, and the first element `i` of `no` is either `i - 1` and satisfies being less than or equal to the minimum value in the `less` list and greater than or equal to the maximum value in the `big` list, or `i` remains unchanged as the first element of `no`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `no` is a non-empty list, and the first element `i` of `no` is either `i - 1` and satisfies being less than or equal to the minimum value in the `less` list and greater than or equal to the maximum value in the `big` list, or `i` remains unchanged as the next element of `no`; `num` is decremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `no` is a non-empty list with the first element removed, `i` is the second element of the updated `no`, `num` is decremented by 1, and if `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in the `less` list and greater than or equal to the maximum value in the `big` list, the condition holds true.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
