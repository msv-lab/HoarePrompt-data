Output State: **`no` is a list, `num` is 0, `big` is a list containing `a`, `less` is a list containing `a`, `iterable2` is 2, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `big.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `big`. Since `x` is an input integer and `a` is an input integer, the value of `a` is added to the list `big`. The values of the other variables (`no`, `num`, `less`, `iterable2`, `x`, and `a`) remain unchanged.
