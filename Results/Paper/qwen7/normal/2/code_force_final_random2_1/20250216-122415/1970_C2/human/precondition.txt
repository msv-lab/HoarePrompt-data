nodes is a list of integers representing the number of nodes in the tree (2 ≤ nodes[0] ≤ 2 × 10^5), start is an integer representing the starting node for each round (1 ≤ start ≤ nodes[0]), and parent is an optional integer representing the parent node of the current node during the depth-first search (default is None).
