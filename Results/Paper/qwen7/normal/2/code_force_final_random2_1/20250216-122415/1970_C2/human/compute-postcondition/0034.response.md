Output State: **`start` is an input integer, moves is the result of func_1(nodes, start)**

Explanation: The function `func_1(nodes, start)` is called with `nodes` and `start` as arguments. The result of this function call is assigned to the variable `moves`. The initial state of `start` remains unchanged, and the new state includes the assignment of `moves` to the result of the function call. The `leaves` deque remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code snippet provided.
