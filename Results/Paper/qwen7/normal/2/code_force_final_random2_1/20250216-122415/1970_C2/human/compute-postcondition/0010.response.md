Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `t` is 1, `edges` is a list containing one pair of integers \((u, v)\), `start` is an integer such that \(1 \leq start \leq n\), `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a `defaultdict` where `nodes[u]` contains the value `[v]` and `nodes[v]` contains the value `[u]`, `u` is an integer read from input, `v` is an integer read from input, `nodes[u]` now contains the value `[v, v]` (since the code appends `v` to `nodes[u]`).**

Explanation: The code `nodes[u].append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `nodes[u]`. Initially, `nodes[u]` contained `[v]`. After appending `v` again, `nodes[u]` now contains `[v, v]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
