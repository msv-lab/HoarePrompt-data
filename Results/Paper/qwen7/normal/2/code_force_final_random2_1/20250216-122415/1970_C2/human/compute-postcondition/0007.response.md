Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is a list containing one pair of integers `(u, v)`, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict where `nodes[u]` contains the value `[v]` and `nodes[v]` contains the value `[u]` and all other values are still empty lists.**

Explanation: The code `nodes[v].append(u)` appends the value `u` to the list `nodes[v]`. Initially, `nodes[u]` contains `[v]`, so after executing the code, `nodes[v]` will contain `[u]` in addition to its original value, which is an empty list. All other values remain unchanged.
