Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, the `leaves` deque will contain all the leaf nodes (nodes with exactly one connection) in the graph.**

Explanation: The loop iterates over each node in the `nodes` dictionary. For each node, it checks if the length of the list of connected nodes (`nodes[key]`) is exactly 1. If so, the node is considered a leaf node and is appended to the `leaves` deque. This process continues until all nodes have been checked. Since the loop runs `n-1` times, where `n` is the number of nodes in the graph, every node will eventually be processed. Therefore, by the end of the loop, `leaves` will contain all the leaf nodes of the graph.
