Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a tree with `n` nodes.
   - There are `t` rounds, but since `t = 1`, we only need to handle one round.
   - In each round, a stone is placed on a specific node.
   - Players take turns moving the stone to an unactivated neighbor.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.
   - The goal is to determine the winner if both players play optimally.

2. **Key Components of the Solution:**
   - The function `func_1` is intended to check if a node can be moved from. However, its implementation seems flawed.
   - The function `func_2` reads input and calls `func_1` to determine the winner.

3. **Analysis of `func_1`:**
   - This function is supposed to determine if a node can be moved from.
   - It checks if the node has more than one child (excluding the parent).
   - If the node has only one child (a leaf node), it returns `False`.
   - Otherwise, it recursively checks its children.
   - The logic inside the function is not correctly implemented for determining if a node can be moved from. It should check if any of its children can be moved from, not just if it has more than one child.

4. **Analysis of `func_2`:**
   - Reads the number of nodes `n` and the number of rounds `t`.
   - Constructs the tree using adjacency lists.
   - Identifies leaf nodes and stores them in a deque.
   - Reads the starting node for the round.
   - Calls `func_1` to determine the winner.
   - The logic here is flawed because `func_1` does not correctly determine if a node can be moved from.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - To determine the winner, we need to use the concept of Grundy numbers (or Nimbers) in combinatorial game theory.
   - For a tree, the Grundy number of a node is the minimum excludant (mex) of the Grundy numbers of its children.
   - The Grundy number of a leaf node is 0.
   - The Grundy number of a node is 1 if it has at least one child with a Grundy number of 0.
   - The final Grundy number of the root node determines the winner.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the winner of the game. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
