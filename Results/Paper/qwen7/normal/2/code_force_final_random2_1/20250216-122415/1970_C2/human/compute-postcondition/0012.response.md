Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\)
   - `t` is 1
   - `edges` is a list containing one pair of integers \((u, v)\)
   - `start` is an integer such that \(1 \leq start \leq n\)
   - `empty` is `True`
   - `nodes` is a `defaultdict` where `nodes[u]` contains the value `[v, u]` and `nodes[v]` contains the value `[u]`

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n - 1):
   ```

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 1.
   - For the next iteration, `i` needs to be 2.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that changes is `i`.
   - Therefore, we need to update `i` to 2.
   - All other variables (`n`, `t`, `edges`, `start`, `empty`, `nodes`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `i` is now 2
   - `n` remains an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\)
   - `t` remains 1
   - `edges` remains a list containing one pair of integers \((u, v)\)
   - `start` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq start \leq n\)
   - `empty` remains `True`
   - `nodes` remains a `defaultdict` where `nodes[u]` contains the value `[v, u]` and `nodes[v]` contains the value `[u]`

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `t` is 1, `edges` is a list containing one pair of integers \((u, v)\), `start` is an integer such that \(1 \leq start \leq n\), `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a `defaultdict` where `nodes[u]` contains the value `[v, u]` and `nodes[v]` contains the value `[u]`**
