Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `t` is 1, `edges` is a list containing one pair of integers \((u, v)\), `start` is an integer such that \(1 \leq start \leq n\), `empty` is `True`, `nodes` is a `defaultdict` where `nodes[u]` contains the value `[v, u]` and `nodes[v]` contains the value `[u, v]` with an additional element `[u]` appended to `nodes[v]`, `u` is an integer obtained from the input, `v` is an integer obtained from the input.**

In this output state, the `nodes` dictionary has been updated such that the list associated with key `v` now includes the integer `u` in addition to its previous value `[u, v]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
