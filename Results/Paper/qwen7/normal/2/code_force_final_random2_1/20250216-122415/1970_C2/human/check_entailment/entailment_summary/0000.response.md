Reasoning:
1. The problem statement specifies that there is only one round (\(t = 1\)) and the tree has \(n\) nodes.
2. The goal is to determine if Ron can make a move from the starting node to an unvisited node in one step. If so, Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins.
3. The `func_1` function checks if there exists any direct child of the starting node that can be moved to in one step. This is done by recursively checking the children of the starting node.
4. The `func_2` function correctly reads the input, constructs the tree, identifies the starting node, and uses `func_1` to check if a move is possible.
5. The logic in `func_2` is sound:
   - It constructs the tree using adjacency lists.
   - It identifies all leaf nodes but does not need them for the current problem since only the direct children of the starting node are relevant.
   - It calls `func_1` with the starting node and checks the result to determine the winner.

Given the problem constraints and the provided functions, the implementation appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
