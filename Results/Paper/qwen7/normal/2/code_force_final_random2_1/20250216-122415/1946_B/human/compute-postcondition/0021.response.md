Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `x` in the range of `a`. However, the loop head itself does not directly involve `x`. Instead, it involves the variables `tmp` and `t`.

2. **Understand the loop body effects**:
   - `tmp` is updated to be the maximum of 0 and the sum of its original value plus `x`.
   - `t` is updated to be the maximum of `tmp` and `t`.

3. **Determine the state changes**:
   - After the previous iteration, `tmp` and `t` have been updated based on the value of `x`.
   - For the next iteration, `x` will take the next value from the list `a`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `x` is the iterating variable, it will change in the next iteration.
   - `tmp` and `t` will be updated again based on the new value of `x`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `tmp` will be updated to be the maximum of 0 and the sum of its current value (after the previous iteration) plus the next value of `x`.
   - `t` will be updated to be the maximum of the new value of `tmp` and its current value.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these updates.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`tmp` is updated to be the maximum of 0 and the sum of its current value plus the next value of `x`; `t` is the maximum of the new value of `tmp` and `t`**.
