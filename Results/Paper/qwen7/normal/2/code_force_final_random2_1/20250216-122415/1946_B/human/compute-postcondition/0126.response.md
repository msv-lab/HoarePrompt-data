Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `ans` is (((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t % MOD), `a` is an empty list, `tmp` is equal to `t`, `t` is 4 * t % MOD, `ans` is `ans` % MOD**

Explanation: The code `t *= 2` doubles the value of `t`. Initially, `t` was `2 * t % MOD`, so after executing `t *= 2`, the new value of `t` becomes `4 * t % MOD`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
