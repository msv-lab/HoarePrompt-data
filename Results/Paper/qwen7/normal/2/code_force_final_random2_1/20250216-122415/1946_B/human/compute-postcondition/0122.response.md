Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0, `ans` is \(((s + t) \% MOD + MOD) \% MOD\), `a` is an empty list, `tmp` is equal to `t`, `t` is 2 * t, `t` is `t \% MOD`**

Explanation: The code `t %= MOD` updates the value of `t` to `t % MOD`. Given that `t` was previously `2 * t`, the new value of `t` is `2 * t % MOD`. The other variables (`i`, `k`, `ans`, `a`, `tmp`) remain unchanged.
