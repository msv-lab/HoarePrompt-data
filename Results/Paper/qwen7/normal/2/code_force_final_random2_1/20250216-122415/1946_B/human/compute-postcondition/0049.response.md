Output State: **`ans` is \((s + t) \% MOD + t \% MOD\), `i` is \(k-1\), `t` is \((2^{(k-1)} \times \text{initial value of } tmp) \% MOD\), `T` is \(T-1\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from stdin.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input from standard input, splits it into a list of strings, and converts each string to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. This list of integers is assigned to the variable `a`. However, none of the other variables (`ans`, `i`, `t`, `T`, `n`, `k`) are affected by this operation. Therefore, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
