Output State: **`ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t`, `i` is 0, `t` is (2 * the maximum value that `tmp` could reach during the loop execution) % MOD**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by `t`. Given the initial state, `ans` was `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`. After adding `t` to `ans`, the new value of `ans` becomes `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t`. The values of `i` and `t` remain unchanged.
