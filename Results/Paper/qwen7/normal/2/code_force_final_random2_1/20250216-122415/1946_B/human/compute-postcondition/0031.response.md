Output State: **`ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`, `i` is 0, `t` is (2 * the maximum value that `tmp` could reach during the loop execution) % MOD**

Explanation: The code snippet `t %= MOD` updates the value of `t` to be `t % MOD`. This operation ensures that `t` is within the range from 0 to `MOD-1`. The other variables (`ans` and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
