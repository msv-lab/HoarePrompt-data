Output State: **`tmp` is 0, `x` is the next element in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `tmp` to 0. Since no further operations are performed on `tmp` or `x` within the given snippet, their values remain as they were initially set. Therefore, `tmp` is 0 and `x` is the next element in the list `a`.
