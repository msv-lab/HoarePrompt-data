Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given code is `i`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `k - 1`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `k - 1` must be a positive integer
   - `t` is 0
   - `ans` is 0

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop continues as long as `i < k - 1`, if `i` is currently 0, the loop can execute one more time if `k - 1` is greater than 0.
   - After the first iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `k - 1` must still be a positive integer.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 1
- `k - 1` must be a positive integer (unchanged)

Since `t` and `ans` are not part of the loop head, they remain unchanged.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `k - 1` must be a positive integer, `t` is 0, `ans` is 0**
