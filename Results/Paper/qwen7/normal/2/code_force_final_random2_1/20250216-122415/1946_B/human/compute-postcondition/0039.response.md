Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(k - 1)`. The variables involved in this loop are `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is (`s` + `t`) % `MOD`
   - `i` is 1
   - `t` is (`t` % `MOD`)

3. **Understand how the loop affects the variables**:
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.
   - The loop runs for `k - 1` iterations.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and the loop runs for `k - 1` iterations, after the previous iteration, `i` would be `2` (because it was incremented once).

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - The only variable that changes within the loop head is `i`.
   - Therefore, we need to update `i` to `3` (since it will be incremented again in the next iteration).

6. **Verify other variables**:
   - `ans` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`ans` is (`s` + `t`) % `MOD`, `i` is 3, `t` is (`t` % `MOD`)**
