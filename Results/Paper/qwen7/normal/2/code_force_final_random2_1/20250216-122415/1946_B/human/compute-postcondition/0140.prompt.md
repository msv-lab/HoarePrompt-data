Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an integer read from standard input and stripped of whitespace, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `MOD` is 1000000007.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())
    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))
    s = sum(a)
    t, tmp = 0, 0
    for x in a:
        tmp += x
        if tmp < 0:
            tmp = 0
        t = max(tmp, t)
    ans = ((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD
    for i in range(k - 1):
        t *= 2
        t %= MOD
        ans += t
        ans %= MOD
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `ans` is (`s` + `t`) % `MOD` + `t` % `MOD`, `i` is `k-1`, `t` is (2^(`k-1`) * the initial value of `tmp`) % `MOD`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations (i.e., `k-1` times), the value of `ans` will be the sum of `s` and the cumulative value of `t` after each iteration, all taken modulo `MOD`. The variable `t` will be equal to (2^(k-1) * the initial value of `tmp`) % `MOD`, as it doubles in each iteration starting from an initial value of 0. The variable `i` will be `k-1` since the loop runs `k-1` times.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `i` is `k-2`; `k - 1` must be a positive integer; `t` is \(2^{(k-2)} \mod \text{MOD}\); `ans` is the sum of all powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{(k-2)}\) modulo `MOD`.

To explain this in simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations (i.e., when `i` reaches `k-2`), the variable `t` will hold the value of \(2^{(k-2)}\) modulo `MOD`. The variable `ans` will hold the sum of all numbers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{(k-2)}\) taken modulo `MOD`. This is because in each iteration of the loop, `t` is doubled and then taken modulo `MOD`, and `ans` is incremented by the current value of `t` and also taken modulo `MOD`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is `k-1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `ans` is ((((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t % MOD) * (2^k - 1)), `a` is an empty list, `tmp` is equal to `t`, `t` is `2^k * t % MOD`, `ans` is `ans` % MOD.

In this final state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `k-1` since the loop runs from `0` to `k-2`. The variable `t` will be updated to `2^k * t % MOD` because it gets multiplied by `2` in each iteration. The variable `ans` accumulates the value of `t` in each iteration, starting from `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD` and adding `t` for each iteration, resulting in `(((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + t % MOD) * (2^k - 1)`. The variable `a` remains an empty list as it is not affected by the loop, and `tmp` remains equal to `t` as it is not reassigned within the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
