Output State: **`i` is 2, `k - 1` must be a positive integer, `t` is 4 % MOD, `ans` is 4 % MOD, `t` is updated to 4 % MOD**

Explanation: The code `t %= MOD` updates the value of `t` to be `t % MOD`. Since `t` was initially `4 % MOD`, and the operation does not change its value, `t` remains `4 % MOD`. The other variables (`i`, `k - 1`, and `ans`) are not affected by this operation.
