Output State: **`tmp` is 0, `t` is 0, and `x` is the next element in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `t = max(tmp, t)` updates `t` to be the maximum of `tmp` and `t`. Given that both `tmp` and `t` are initially 0, the maximum of 0 and 0 is 0. Therefore, `t` remains 0. The values of `tmp` and `x` remain unchanged.
