Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input, `k` is an integer obtained from the second input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the third line of input.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input using `sys.stdin.readline()`, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, splits the line into individual elements, and maps each element to an integer. This creates a list of integers which is assigned to the variable `a`. The values of `T`, `t`, `MOD`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
