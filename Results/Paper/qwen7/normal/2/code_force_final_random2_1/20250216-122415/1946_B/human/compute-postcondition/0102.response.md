Output State: **`tmp` is 0, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, and the current value of `tmp` is less than 0.**

Explanation: The code sets `tmp` to 0. This changes the value of `tmp` from its previous state (which was less than 0) to 0. The list `a` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it.
