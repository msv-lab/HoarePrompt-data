Output State: **`tmp` is the maximum of its original value plus `x` and `t`, and if the current value of `tmp` is less than 0, then `tmp` is set to 0; otherwise, `tmp` retains its value as the original value of `tmp` plus `x`; `x` is the next element in the list `a`, and `tmp` is updated by adding `x` to its current value.**

In more detail:
- The value of `tmp` is updated by adding `x` to its current value.
- The value of `x` is set to the next element in the list `a`.
- The condition that `tmp` is the maximum of its original value plus `x` and `t`, and if the current value of `tmp` is less than 0, then `tmp` is set to 0; otherwise, `tmp` retains its value as the original value of `tmp` plus `x` remains unchanged.
