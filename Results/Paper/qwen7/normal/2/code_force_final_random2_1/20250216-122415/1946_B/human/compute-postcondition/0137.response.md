Output State: `i` is `k-1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `ans` is the sum of `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD` and `t` added `k-1` times, `a` is an empty list, `tmp` is equal to `t`, `t` is \(2^{(k-1)} \times t \mod \text{MOD}\), `ans` is `ans` % MOD.

To break it down in simple terms:
- The variable `i` will be `k-1` after the loop finishes because the loop runs from `0` to `k-2`.
- The variable `t` will be updated to \(2^{(k-1)} \times t \mod \text{MOD}\) after all iterations since `t` doubles in each iteration.
- The variable `ans` will be the initial value of `ans` plus `t` added `k-1` times, all taken modulo `MOD`.
