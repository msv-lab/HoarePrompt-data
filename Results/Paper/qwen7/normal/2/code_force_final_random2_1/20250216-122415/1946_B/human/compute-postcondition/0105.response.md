Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers, `tmp` is equal to the maximum of `tmp` and `t`, and if the current value of `tmp` is less than 0, then `tmp` is set to 0.**

Explanation: The code `t = max(tmp, t)` updates the value of `t` to be the maximum of `tmp` and `t`. The initial value of `tmp` is the sum of all elements in `a` plus the last value added to `tmp`. If the current value of `tmp` is less than 0, `tmp` is set to 0. The list `a` and the condition for `tmp` remain unchanged.
