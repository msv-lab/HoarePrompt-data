Output State: **`i` is 2, `k - 1` must be a positive integer, `t` is 4 % MOD, `ans` is 4 % MOD**

Explanation: The code multiplies the value of `t` by 2. Initially, `t` is equal to `2 % MOD`. After the operation, `t` becomes `4 % MOD`. The values of `i` and `k - 1` remain unchanged. The value of `ans` also becomes `4 % MOD` since it was previously `2 % MOD` and now follows the updated value of `t`.
