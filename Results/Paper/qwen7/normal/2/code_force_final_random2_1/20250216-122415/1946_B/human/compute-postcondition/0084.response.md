Output State: **`i` is 1, `k - 1` must be a positive integer, `t` is 2 % MOD, `ans` is 2 % MOD**

Explanation: The code `ans %= MOD` performs the modulus operation on `ans` with `MOD`. Since `ans` is initially `2 % MOD`, and the operation does not change its value (as it is already the result of the modulus operation), `ans` remains `2 % MOD`. All other variables (`i`, `k - 1`, and `t`) remain unchanged.
