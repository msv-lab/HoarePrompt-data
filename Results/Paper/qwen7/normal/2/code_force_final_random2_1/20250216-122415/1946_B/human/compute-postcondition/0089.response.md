Output State: **`i` is 2, `k - 1` must be a positive integer, `t` is 4 % MOD, `ans` is 0 % MOD**

Explanation: The code `ans %= MOD` updates the value of `ans` by taking the modulus with `MOD`. Given that `ans` is initially `8 % MOD`, after applying the modulus operation, `ans` becomes `0 % MOD` since `8 % MOD` would reduce to `0` if `MOD` is greater than 8. The values of the other variables (`i`, `k - 1`, and `t`) remain unchanged.
