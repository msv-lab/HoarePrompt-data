Output State: `ans` is (`s` + `t`) % `MOD` + `t` % `MOD`, `i` is `k-1`, `t` is (2^(`k-1`) * the initial value of `tmp`) % `MOD`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations (i.e., `k-1` times), the value of `ans` will be the sum of `s` and the cumulative value of `t` after each iteration, all taken modulo `MOD`. The variable `t` will be equal to (2^(k-1) * the initial value of `tmp`) % `MOD`, as it doubles in each iteration starting from an initial value of 0. The variable `i` will be `k-1` since the loop runs `k-1` times.
