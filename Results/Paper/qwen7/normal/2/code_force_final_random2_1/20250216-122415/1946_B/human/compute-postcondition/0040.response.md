Output State: **`ans` is (`s` + `t`) % `MOD`, `i` is 3, `t` is (`t` * 2) % `MOD`**

Explanation: The code `t *= 2` multiplies the current value of `t` by 2 and then assigns the result back to `t`. Since `t` was initially (`t` % `MOD`), after multiplying by 2, `t` becomes (`t` * 2) % `MOD`. The values of `ans` and `i` remain unchanged.
