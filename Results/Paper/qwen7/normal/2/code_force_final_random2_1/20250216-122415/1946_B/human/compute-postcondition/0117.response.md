Output State: **`tmp` is the maximum of `tmp` plus `x` or `t`, `a` remains the same, and if `tmp` is less than 0 after adding `x`, `tmp` becomes 0.**

Explanation: The code updates `t` to be the maximum of its current value and `tmp`. If `tmp` was less than 0 after adding `x`, it became 0. The value of `a` remains unchanged.
