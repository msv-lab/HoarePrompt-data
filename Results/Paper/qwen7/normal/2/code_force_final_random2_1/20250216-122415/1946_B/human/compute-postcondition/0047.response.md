Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `ans` is \((s + t) \% MOD + t \% MOD\)
   - `i` is \(k-1\)
   - `t` is \((2^{(k-1)} \times \text{initial value of } tmp) \% MOD\)

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for _ in range(T):`

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs `T` times.
   - Each iteration updates the values of `ans` and `t`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - The only variables in the loop head are `_` (which is just a placeholder for the loop counter) and `T`.
   - Since the loop runs `T` times, we need to ensure that `T` is decremented by 1 for each iteration.

5. **Current State:**
   - We need to adjust the state such that the loop can execute one more time.
   - This means decrementing `T` by 1.

6. **New State:**
   - `ans` remains the same because the loop has not yet started.
   - `i` remains the same because the loop has not yet started.
   - `t` remains the same because the loop has not yet started.
   - `T` is decremented by 1.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`ans` is \((s + t) \% MOD + t \% MOD\), `i` is \(k-1\), `t` is \((2^{(k-1)} \times \text{initial value of } tmp) \% MOD\), `T` is \(T-1\)**
