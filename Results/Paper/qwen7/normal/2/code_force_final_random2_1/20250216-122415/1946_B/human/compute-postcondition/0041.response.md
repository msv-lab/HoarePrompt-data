Output State: **`ans` is (`s` + `t`) % `MOD`, `i` is 3, `t` is (`t` * 2) % `MOD`, `t` is now `t` % `MOD`**

Explanation: The code `t %= MOD` updates the value of `t` to be `t` modulo `MOD`. This means that `t` is now the remainder when `t` is divided by `MOD`. Since `t` was already equal to `t * 2 % MOD` before this line, the new value of `t` remains the same as its previous value because taking `t` modulo `MOD` again does not change its value if it is already within the range of 0 to `MOD-1`. The other variables `ans` and `i` remain unchanged.
