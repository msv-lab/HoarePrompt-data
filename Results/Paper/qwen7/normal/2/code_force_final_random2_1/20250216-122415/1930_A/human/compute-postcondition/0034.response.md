The loop condition in the given `while` loop is `numbers != []`. This means the loop continues as long as the list `numbers` is not empty. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that the list `numbers` remains non-empty.

Let's analyze the current state:
- `suma` is 4
- `numCases` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 2
- `numInteger` is an input integer
- `numbers` is a non-empty list of strings starting with the second smallest number except the first element
- `a` is the first element of the updated `numbers` list converted to an integer
- `b` is the first element of the original `numbers` list converted to an integer

Since the loop continues as long as `numbers` is not empty, no changes are needed to the elements within `numbers` itself. The only way to ensure the loop can execute one more time is to maintain that `numbers` is non-empty.

Therefore, the state does not need to be modified further for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`suma` is 4, `numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a non-empty list of strings starting with the second smallest number except the first element, `a` is the first element of the updated `numbers` list converted to an integer, `b` is the first element of the original `numbers` list converted to an integer**
