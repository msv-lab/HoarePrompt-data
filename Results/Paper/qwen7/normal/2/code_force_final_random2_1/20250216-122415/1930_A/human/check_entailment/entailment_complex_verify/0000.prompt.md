You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    numCases = int(input())
    for i in range(numCases):
        numInteger = int(input())
        numbers = input().split()
        numbers.sort(reverse=False)
        suma = 0
        while numbers != []:
            a = int(numbers.pop(0))
            b = int(numbers.pop(0))
            suma += min(a, b)
        print(suma)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the numbers on the whiteboard are 2n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_{2n} where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
def func():
    numCases = int(input())
    for i in range(numCases):
        numInteger = int(input())
        
        numbers = input().split()
        
        numbers.sort(reverse=False)

    #State: Output State: `numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `numCases`, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is an empty list, `a` is the last element of the original list converted to an integer, `b` is the second last element of the original list converted to an integer, `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of all consecutive pairs from the original list.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `numbers` will be an empty list since all elements have been processed in pairs. The variable `i` will be equal to `numCases` because the loop iterates `numCases` times. The variable `suma` will contain the sum of the minimum values of all consecutive pairs from the original list. The variables `a` and `b` will hold the values of the last two elements of the original list, respectively.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` and another integer `n`, followed by `2n` integers representing numbers on a whiteboard. It then sorts these numbers in ascending order and calculates the sum of the minimum values of all consecutive pairs from the sorted list. Finally, it prints the calculated sum for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the score. Specifically, the program simply pops the first two elements from the sorted list and adds their minimum value to the score, which does not guarantee the maximum possible score.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
4
8 1 1 8
```

The correct approach would be to pair the smallest available numbers to maximize the score. However, the current implementation will pair the first two numbers (8 and 1), resulting in a score of 1. A better pairing would be (1, 1) and (8, 8), resulting in a score of 2.

To fix this, the program should sort the list and then iteratively pair the smallest remaining numbers. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    numCases = int(input())
    for i in range(numCases):
        numInteger = int(input())
        numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))
        numbers.sort()
        suma = 0
        while numbers:
            a = numbers.pop(0)
            b = numbers.pop(0)
            suma += min(a, b)
        print(suma)
```

This corrected version ensures that the smallest available numbers are paired, thereby maximizing the score.
