Based on the initial state provided:

- `suma` is the sum of all minimum pairs from the list.
- `numCases` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 2.
- `numInteger` is an input integer.
- `numbers` is an empty list.
- `a` is the last element processed (if any).
- `b` is the last element processed (if any).

Since `numbers` is an empty list, there are no pairs to compare and add to `suma`. Therefore, `suma` remains 0.

Output: **0**
