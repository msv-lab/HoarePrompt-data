Output State: **`numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a non-empty list of strings sorted in ascending order with at least one element removed, `b` is the first element of the original list converted to an integer, `suma` is `suma + min(a, b)`, `a` is the second element of the original list converted to an integer minus the first element.**

Explanation: The code `b = int(numbers.pop(0))` pops the first element from the list `numbers` and converts it to an integer, assigning it to `b`. The precondition that `numbers` is a non-empty list of strings sorted in ascending order remains valid, but now it has one element less. The other variables remain unchanged except for `b`, which now holds the value of the first element of the original list converted to an integer.
