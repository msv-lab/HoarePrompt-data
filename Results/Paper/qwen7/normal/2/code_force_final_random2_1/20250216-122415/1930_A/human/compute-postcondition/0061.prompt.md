Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `numCases` is an input integer, and the values of `t` and `n` and the numbers on the whiteboard are unchanged
Code of the loop:
for i in range(numCases):
    numInteger = int(input())
    numbers = input().split()
    numbers.sort(reverse=False)
    suma = 0
    while numbers != []:
        a = int(numbers.pop(0))
        b = int(numbers.pop(0))
        suma += min(a, b)
    print(suma)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is an empty list, `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of all consecutive pairs of integers from the original `numbers` list, `a` is the last element processed (if any), `b` is the last element processed (if any).

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, `numbers` will be an empty list because each iteration removes two elements from the list until no elements are left. The variable `suma` will contain the sum of the minimum values of all consecutive pairs of integers from the original `numbers` list. The variables `a` and `b` will hold the last two elements that were processed, if any elements remain after the loop completes. However, since the list is empty by the end of the loop, `a` and `b` will effectively be undefined or can be considered as having no specific value in the context of the final state.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `suma` is the sum of all minimum pairs from the list, `numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is an empty list, `a` is the last element processed (if any), `b` is the last element processed (if any).

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the `numbers` list will be empty since the loop continues as long as the list is not empty. The variable `suma` will hold the sum of the minimum values from each pair of elements taken from the `numbers` list during each iteration. The values of `i`, `numCases`, and `numInteger` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop. The variables `a` and `b` will contain the last two elements that were compared and added to `suma`, respectively.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is an empty list, `a` is the third element of the original list converted to an integer minus the first two elements, `b` is the second element of the original list converted to an integer minus the first element, `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of all consecutive pairs from the original list.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `numbers` will be an empty list since all elements have been processed in pairs. The variables `a` and `b` will hold the values of the first and second elements of the original list, respectively, adjusted by the number of elements processed. The variable `suma` will contain the sum of the minimum values of all consecutive pairs from the original list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
