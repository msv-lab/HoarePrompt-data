You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the numbers on the whiteboard are 2n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_{2n} where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
def func():
    numCases = int(input())
    for i in range(numCases):
        numInteger = int(input())
        
        numbers = input().split()
        
        numbers.sort(reverse=False)
        
        suma = 0
        
        while numbers != []:
            a = int(numbers.pop(0))
            b = int(numbers.pop(0))
            suma += min(a, b)
        
        print(suma)
        
    #State: Output State: `numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `numCases`, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is an empty list, `a` is the last element of the original list converted to an integer, `b` is the second last element of the original list converted to an integer, `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of all consecutive pairs from the original list.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `numbers` will be an empty list since all elements have been processed in pairs. The variable `i` will be equal to `numCases` because the loop iterates `numCases` times. The variable `suma` will contain the sum of the minimum values of all consecutive pairs from the original list. The variables `a` and `b` will hold the values of the last two elements of the original list, respectively.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of test cases where each case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) and another integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). For each test case, it also receives 2n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7). The function returns different outputs based on the conditions specified for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
