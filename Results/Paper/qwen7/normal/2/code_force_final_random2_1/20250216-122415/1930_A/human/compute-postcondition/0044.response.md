Output State: **`numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a list of strings sorted in ascending order, `a` is the last element processed (if any), `b` is the last element processed (if any)**.

Explanation: The `sort()` method is called on the `numbers` list with `reverse=False`, which sorts the list in ascending order. The values of `numCases`, `i`, `numInteger`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
