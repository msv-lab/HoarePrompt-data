The only variable in the loop head is the `numbers` list. For the loop to execute the first time, the `numbers` list must not be empty.

Given the current state:
- `numCases` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 3
- `numInteger` is an input integer
- `numbers` is a list of strings sorted in ascending order
- `a` is the last element processed (if any)
- `b` is the last element processed (if any)
- `suma` is 0

To ensure the loop can execute the first time, the `numbers` list must be non-empty. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `numbers`.

State: **`numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a non-empty list of strings sorted in ascending order, `a` is the last element processed (if any), `b` is the last element processed (if any), `suma` is 0**
