Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases (`numCases`) and iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the value of `numInteger` which is `2n`, and the list of `2n` integers from the input.
3. It sorts the list of integers in ascending order.
4. It then enters a loop where it repeatedly pops the first two elements from the sorted list, takes their minimum, and adds it to the total score (`suma`).
5. This process continues until the list is empty, meaning all pairs have been processed.
6. Finally, it prints the total score (`suma`) for each test case.

Given the logic of the program, it correctly implements the strategy to maximize the score by always choosing the smallest available pair at each step, which ensures the highest possible score according to the problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
