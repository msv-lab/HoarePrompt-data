Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of test cases where each case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) and another integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). For each test case, it also receives 2n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7). The function returns different outputs based on the conditions specified for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters and a list of integers. It processes these inputs according to the given constraints and returns appropriate results for each case.
