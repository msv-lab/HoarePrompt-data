Output State: **`numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a list of strings (converted from input), `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of all consecutive pairs of integers from the original `numbers` list, `a` is the last element processed (if any), `b` is the last element processed (if any)**.

Explanation: The code `numbers = input().split()` takes an input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `numbers`. The other variables (`numCases`, `i`, `numInteger`, `suma`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged in terms of their conditions or values. `numInteger` remains an input integer, and `numbers` now holds the split input as a list of strings.
