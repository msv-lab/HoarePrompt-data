Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. The initial values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The input string is split and converted to integers, forming the new list `a`.
