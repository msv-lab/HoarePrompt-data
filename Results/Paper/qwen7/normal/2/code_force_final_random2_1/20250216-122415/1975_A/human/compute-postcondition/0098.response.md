Output: **YES**

Explanation:
- The initial state tells us that `t` is greater than 0, but this information is not directly relevant to the `print` statement.
- `n` is an input integer, but its specific value is not needed to determine the output of the `print` statement.
- `a` is a list of integers converted from input, but again, the specific values in the list are not necessary to determine the output.
- `check_all` is the result of the `all` function checking if each element in the list `a` from index 1 to n-1 is less than or equal to the next element. This value is not needed to determine the output.
- `i` is equal to `n`, which is an integer.
- `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 3 to the end of the list, but this information is also not needed to determine the output.
- `new_all` is True if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, but this value is not required to determine the output.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`, regardless of the values of the other variables.
