Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case defined by the variables t, n, and a, where t is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, n is an integer between 2 and 50, and a is a list of n positive integers each between 1 and 10^6. The function returns a value based on the given conditions for each test case.**
