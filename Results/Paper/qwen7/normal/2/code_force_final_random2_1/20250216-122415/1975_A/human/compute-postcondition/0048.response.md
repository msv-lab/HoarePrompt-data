Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, and `n` is assigned the value of int(input()).**

The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `a`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
