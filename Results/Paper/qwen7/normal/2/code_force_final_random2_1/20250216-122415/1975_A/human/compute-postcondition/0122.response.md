Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `new` is a list containing elements from `a[2:]`, `check_all_new` is a boolean value determined by the condition `(a[0] >= new[i-1])` for each `i` in the range of the length of `new`, `new_all` is a boolean value determined by the condition `all([(new[i-1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))]), and in both cases (whether the condition `check_all_new and new_all` is true or false), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
