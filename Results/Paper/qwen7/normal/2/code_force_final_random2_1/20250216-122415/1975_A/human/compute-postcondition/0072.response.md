Output: **YES**

Explanation:
- The initial state tells us that `t` is greater than 1 and `n` is greater than 1, but these values do not affect the execution of the `print('YES')` statement.
- `a` is a list of integers, but its specific contents are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact elements of `a`.
- `check_all` is `False`, but this variable is not used in the `print` statement.
- `i` is set to 2, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
- `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 2 to the end of the list, so `new = a[2:]`.
- `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, but its value is not needed for the `print` statement.
- The `print('YES')` statement directly prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output is simply the string `'YES'`.
