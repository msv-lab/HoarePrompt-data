Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `new` is a list containing elements from `a[2:]`. This means `new` contains elements starting from the third element of the list `a`.
   - `check_all_new` is a boolean value determined by the condition `(a[0] >= new[i-1])` for each `i` in the range of the length of `new`.
   - `new_all` is a boolean value determined by the condition `all([(new[i-1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement simply outputs `'NO'`.

Given the initial state, the print statement does not depend on the values of `new`, `check_all_new`, or `new_all`. It directly prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **NO**
