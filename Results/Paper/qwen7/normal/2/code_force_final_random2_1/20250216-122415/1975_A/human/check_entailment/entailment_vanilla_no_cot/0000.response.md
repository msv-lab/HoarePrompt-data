Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical flaw. Specifically, the logic for determining if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping does not correctly handle all cases.

1. **Initial Check**: The initial check `check_all = all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])` checks if the array is already non-decreasing. If this is true, it prints 'YES', which is correct.

2. **Secondary Check**: If the array is not initially non-decreasing, the code attempts to find a split point `i` where `a[i-1] > a[i]`. It then checks if the subarray starting from `i` can be placed at the beginning and if the resulting array is non-decreasing. However, this approach is flawed because it only checks one possible split and does not ensure that the entire array can be made non-decreasing through any sequence of splits.

### Example Counter-Case:
Consider the array `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5]`. The provided solution would incorrectly output 'NO' because it only checks one possible split without considering other valid splits that could make the array non-decreasing.

### Correct Approach:
A more robust approach would involve checking all possible splits and ensuring that the resulting array can be made non-decreasing. This can be done by iterating over all possible split points and verifying if the resulting array is non-decreasing.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Initial check if the array is already non-decreasing
        if all(a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)):
            print('YES')
            continue
        
        # Check all possible splits
        for i in range(1, n):
            left = a[:i]
            right = a[i:]
            if all(left[j] <= right[j] for j in range(len(left))) and all(right[j - 1] <= right[j] for j in range(1, len(right))):
                print('YES')
                break
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that all possible splits are checked to see if they can result in a non-decreasing array.
