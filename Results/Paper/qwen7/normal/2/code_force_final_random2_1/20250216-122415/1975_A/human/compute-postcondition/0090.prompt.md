Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `check_all` is True if all elements in `a` from index 0 to n-2 are less than or equal to the next element, otherwise `check_all` is False.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
        new = a[i:]
        check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
        new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
        if check_all_new and new_all:
            print('YES')
            break
        else:
            print('NO')
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is False, `i` is 1, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 1 to the end of the list, `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to the next element, and `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `a` from index 0 to the last index are less than or equal to the next element, in either case, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is False, `i` is 2, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 2 to the end of the list, and `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order. If `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, then `new_all` is calculated as `all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))]), `new` is equal to `a[2:]`, and in either case (if `check_all_new` and `new_all` are true or not), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is False, `i` is 3, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 3 to the end of the list, `new_all` is True if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, and `check_all_new` is a boolean value determined by the condition `(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))`, in either case, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
