Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` must be at least 3, `new` is a list containing elements from `a[3:]`, `check_all_new` is a boolean value determined by the condition `(a[0] >= new[i])` for each `i` in the range of the length of `new`, `new_all` is updated to `all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken if `a[i - 1] > a[i]`.
