You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a is a list of n positive integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        check_all = all([(a[i - 1] <= a[i]) for i in range(1, n)])
        
        if check_all:
            print('YES')
        else:
            for i in range(1, n):
                if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                    new = a[i:]
                    check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
                    new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
                    if check_all_new and new_all:
                        print('YES')
                        break
                    else:
                        print('NO')
                        break
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `t` will be 0, indicating that no more inputs need to be processed. For each iteration of the loop, the conditions described in the previous states will have been checked, and based on those checks, either 'YES' or 'NO' will have been printed for each input list `a`. After all iterations, if `t` was originally greater than 0, it would now be 0, signifying that all inputs have been processed. The final output will be 'NO' if none of the conditions for 'YES' were met across all inputs; otherwise, 'YES' would have been printed for at least one input list `a`.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop, the output will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked for each input list `a`, and the loop variable `t` will be 0, indicating the end of processing.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case defined by the variables t, n, and a, where t is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, n is an integer between 2 and 50, and a is a list of n positive integers each between 1 and 10^6. The function returns a value based on the given conditions for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
