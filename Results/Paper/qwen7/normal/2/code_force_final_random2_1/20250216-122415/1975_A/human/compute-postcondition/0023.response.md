Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `new` is a list starting from `a[0]` to the end of the list `a`, `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to `a[0]`, and `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all consecutive elements in `new` satisfy `new[i-1] <= new[i]` for `i` in range 1 to length of `new`. If both `check_all_new` and `new_all` are true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `check_all_new` is false or `new_all` is false, and we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
