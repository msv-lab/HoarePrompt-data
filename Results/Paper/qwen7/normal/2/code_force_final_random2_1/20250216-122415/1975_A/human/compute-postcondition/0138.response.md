Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to `n`, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 3 to the end of the list, and `new_all` is True if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order. If `check_all` is True, then `new_all` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `new` is updated to a list containing elements from `a[n-1:]`, `check_all_new` is determined by the condition `(a[0] >= new[i])` for each `i` in the range of the length of `new`, and `new_all` is determined by the condition `all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))]). If `check_all_new and new_all` are met for any `i` in the range of the length of `new`, the output is 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.**
