Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `new` is a list containing elements from `a[1:]`, `check_all_new` is a boolean value determined by the condition `(a[0] >= new[i])` for each `i` in the range of the length of `new`, `new_all` is a boolean value determined by the condition `all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])`. The current values satisfy `(check_all_new and new_all)`.
