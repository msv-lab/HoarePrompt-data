Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 3.
- `n` must be at least 3.
- `new` is a list containing elements from `a[3:]`, meaning it starts from the 4th element of the list `a`.
- `check_all_new` is a boolean value determined by the condition `(a[0] >= new[i])` for each `i` in the range of the length of `new`.
- `new_all` is updated to `all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])`, which checks if the list `new` is non-decreasing.

The `print('YES')` statement simply prints the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
