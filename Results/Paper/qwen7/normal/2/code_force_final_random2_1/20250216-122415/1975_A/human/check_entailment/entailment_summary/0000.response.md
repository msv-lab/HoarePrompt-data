Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.
3. It first checks if the array `a` is already non-decreasing using `all([a[i-1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])`. If this condition is true, it prints 'YES' because no operations are needed.
4. If the array is not non-decreasing, it then checks if there exists a valid split where the first part is non-increasing and the second part is non-decreasing. This is done by iterating through possible split points and checking the conditions `all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])` and `all([new[i-1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])`.
5. If such a split is found, it prints 'YES'.
6. If no valid split is found after checking all possible splits, it prints 'NO'.
7. The function ensures that the variable `t` is set to 0 at the end, though this is not strictly necessary for correctness but is a good practice to indicate the end of processing.

Given the above analysis, the function appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
