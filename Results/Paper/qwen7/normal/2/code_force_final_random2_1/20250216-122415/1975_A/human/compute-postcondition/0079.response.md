Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is greater than 1
   - `n` is greater than 1
   - `a` is a list of integers
   - `check_all` is False
   - `i` is 2
   - `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 2 to the end of the list
   - `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n)`, the variable `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 3.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no such modification is mentioned, `n` stays the same.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `t` remains greater than 1.
   - `n` remains greater than 1.
   - `a` remains a list of integers.
   - `check_all` remains False.
   - `new` changes to the sublist of `a` starting from index 3 to the end of the list.
   - `new_all` remains a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, but its value is not directly affected by the loop incrementing `i`.

Given these points, the only variables that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `i` and `n`.

**Final State**:
- `t` is greater than 1
- `n` is greater than 1
- `a` is a list of integers
- `check_all` is False
- `i` is 3
- `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 3 to the end of the list
- `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is False, `i` is 3, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 3 to the end of the list, and `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order**.
