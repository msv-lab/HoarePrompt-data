Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state before the loop starts**: 
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `new` is a list containing elements from `a[2:]`.
   - `check_all_new` is a boolean value determined by the condition `(a[0] >= new[i-1])` for each `i` in the range of the length of `new`.
   - `new_all` is a boolean value determined by the condition `all([(new[i-1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])`.
   - The loop breaks out if either `check_all_new` and `new_all` are both true or if any condition within the loop causes a break.

3. **Determine the state after one iteration**:
   - After one iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.
   - `n` remains the same as it was initially, but since it must be at least 2, this condition still holds.
   - `new` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no modifications are made to `new` in the given information.
   - `check_all_new` and `new_all` remain unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no conditions are evaluated.

4. **Check the loop continuation condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
   - Since `i` is now 3 and `n` is at least 2, the loop will continue if `n` is at least 3.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` is now 3.
   - `n` must be at least 3 to allow the loop to continue.
   - `new`, `check_all_new`, and `new_all` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be at least 3, `new` is a list containing elements from `a[2:]`, `check_all_new` is a boolean value determined by the condition `(a[0] >= new[i-1])` for each `i` in the range of the length of `new`, `new_all` is a boolean value determined by the condition `all([(new[i-1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])`.**
