Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `check_all` is a boolean value indicating whether at least one element in `a` (except the first one) is less than the previous element
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
        new = a[i:]
        check_all_new = all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
        new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
        if check_all_new and new_all:
            print('YES')
            break
        else:
            print('NO')
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `new` is a list starting from `a[0]` to the end of the list `a`, `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to `a[0]`, and `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all consecutive elements in `new` satisfy `new[i-1] <= new[i]` for `i` in range 1 to length of `new`. If both `check_all_new` and `new_all` are true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `check_all_new` is false or `new_all` is false, and we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i` to the end of the list `a`, `check_all_new` is True if all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to `a[0]`, `new_all` is True if all consecutive elements in `new` satisfy `new[i-1] <= new[i]` for `i` in range 1 to length of `new`, and in both cases (whether the if condition is met or not), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 3 to the end of the list `a`, `check_all_new` is True if all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to `a[0]`, `new_all` is True if all consecutive elements in `new` satisfy `new[i-1] <= new[i]` for `i` in range 1 to length of `new`, and in both cases (whether the if condition is true or false), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
