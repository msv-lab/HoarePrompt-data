Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 1
- `n` is greater than 1
- `a` is a list of integers
- `check_all` is `False`
- `i` is `1`
- `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `1` to the end of the list
- `check_all_new` is a boolean value
- `new_all` is a boolean value

The print statement is simply `print('NO')`.

Since the print statement is explicitly printing the string `'NO'`, the output will be exactly that string.

Output: **NO**
