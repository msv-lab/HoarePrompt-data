Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive, `i` is 0, `a` is an empty string, `l` is a non-negative integer (either 1, 2, ..., or the total number of 'A's in the original string `a`), and `h` is a non-negative integer (either 1, 2, ..., or the total number of characters in `a` that are not 'A's). The total count of 'A's (`l`) is less than or equal to the total count of non-'A's (`h`).**
