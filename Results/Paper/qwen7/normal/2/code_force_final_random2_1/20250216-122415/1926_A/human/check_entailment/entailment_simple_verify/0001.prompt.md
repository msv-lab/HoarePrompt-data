You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        l = 0
        h = 0
        for j in a:
            if j == 'A':
                l += 1
            else:
                h += 1
        if l > h:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, and for each test case, the input string is a string of length 5 consisting of characters 'A' and 'B'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        
        l = 0
        
        h = 0
        
        for j in a:
            if j == 'A':
                l += 1
            else:
                h += 1
        
        if l > h:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
        
    #State: All strings `a` have been fully processed, and for each string, `l` contains the total count of 'A' characters, while `h` contains the total count of non-'A' characters. The variable `i` will range from `0` to `t-1`, and `t` remains the same as its initial value. If for any string `a`, the count of 'A' characters (`l`) is greater than the count of non-'A' characters (`h`), then 'A' is printed for that string. Otherwise, 'B' is printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Character Counting**: For each string, the program counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' using two counters `l` (for 'A') and `h` (for 'B').
3. **Comparison and Output**: After counting, the program compares the counts of 'A' and 'B'. If 'A' appears more frequently, it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'.
4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles all given examples correctly. It can handle strings with varying numbers of 'A' and 'B', including edge cases like all 'A's or all 'B's.
5. **Distinct Strings**: The problem statement mentions that all strings are distinct, but this does not affect the correctness of the program as long as the logic works for any string of length 5.

Given that the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all provided test cases accurately, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
