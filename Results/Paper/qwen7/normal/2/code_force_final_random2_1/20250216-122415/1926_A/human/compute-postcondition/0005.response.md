Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for j in a:`. The objects involved here are `j`, `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `j`: This is the variable used to iterate over the elements of `a`. Initially, `j` is not defined.
   - `a`: This is the input string from the user.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `a` is a non-empty string. If `a` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Since `j` is not defined initially and the loop depends on `a` being a non-empty string, we need to ensure that `a` is a non-empty string. The value of `j` will be set during each iteration of the loop, but we don't need to specify its initial value as it is not relevant for the loop condition.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `a` must be a non-empty string.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive, `i` is 0, `a` is a non-empty string, `l` is 0, `h` is 0**
