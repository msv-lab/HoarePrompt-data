Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly set to 1.
- `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9 inclusive.
- `y` is a random integer between 1 and 9 inclusive.
- `z` is a random integer between 1 and 9 inclusive.
- `res` is determined by the conditions involving `x`, `y`, and `z`.

The `print(x, y, z, sep=' ')` statement will print the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` separated by a single space. Since `x`, `y`, and `z` are random integers between 1 and 9, their specific values are unknown but they will be distinct integers within this range.

Output: **x y z (where x, y, and z are random integers between 1 and 9 inclusive)**
