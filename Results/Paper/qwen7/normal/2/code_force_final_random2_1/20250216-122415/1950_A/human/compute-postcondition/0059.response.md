Based on the initial state, we know the following:

- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9 inclusive.
- `y` is a random integer between 1 and 9 inclusive.
- `z` is a random integer between 1 and 9 inclusive.
- `res` is determined based on the conditions involving `x`, `y`, and `z`.

The `print(x, y, z, sep=' ')` statement will print the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` separated by a space. Since `x`, `y`, and `z` are random integers between 1 and 9, their exact values cannot be determined without additional information. However, they will be printed in this format.

Output: **x y z (where x, y, and z are random integers between 1 and 9 inclusive)**
