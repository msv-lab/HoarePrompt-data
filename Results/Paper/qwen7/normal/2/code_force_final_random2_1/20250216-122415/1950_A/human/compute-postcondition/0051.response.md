Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9 inclusive, `y` is a random integer between 1 and 9 inclusive, `z` is a random integer between 1 and 9 inclusive, `res` is 'none', and `i` must be less than or equal to 1000.**

The code assigns the string `'none'` to the variable `res`. Since `i` is initially set to 3 and must be less than or equal to 1000, the only changes are to the variable `res`, which is now assigned the value `'none'`. All other variables retain their initial states.
