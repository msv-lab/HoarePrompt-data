Postcondition: `i` is 3, `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9 inclusive, `y` is a random integer between 1 and 9 inclusive, `z` is a random integer between 1 and 9 inclusive, and `res` is either 'peak', 'stair', or 'none'. Specifically, if `x < y` and `y > z`, then `res` is set to 'peak'; if `x < y` and `y < z`, then `res` is set to 'stair'; if `x < y` and `y == z`, then `res` is set to 'none'. Additionally, `i` must be less than or equal to 1000.
