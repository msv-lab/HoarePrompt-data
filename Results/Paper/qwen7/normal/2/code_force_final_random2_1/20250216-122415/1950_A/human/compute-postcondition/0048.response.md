Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9 inclusive, `y` is a random integer between 1 and 9 inclusive, `z` is a random integer between 1 and 9 inclusive, `res` is an empty string (''), and `i` must be less than or equal to 1000.**

The code `res = ''` assigns an empty string to the variable `res`. No other changes are made to the other variables. Therefore, their values remain as they were in the initial state.
