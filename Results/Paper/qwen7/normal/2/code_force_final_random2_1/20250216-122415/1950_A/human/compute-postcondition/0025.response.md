Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9 inclusive, `y` is a random integer between 1 and 9 inclusive, `z` is a random integer between 1 and 9 inclusive, and `res` is either 'peak' if `y` is greater than `z`, 'stair' if `x` is less than `y` and `y` is not greater than `z`, or 'none' if `x` is greater than or equal to `y`.**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The values of `x`, `y`, `z`, and `res` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
