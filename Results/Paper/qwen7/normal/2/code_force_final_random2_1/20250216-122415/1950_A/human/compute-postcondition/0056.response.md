Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9 inclusive, `y` is a random integer between 1 and 9 inclusive, `z` is a random integer between 1 and 9 inclusive, `res` is 'none', and `i` must be less than or equal to 1000.**

Explanation: The code assigns the string `'none'` to the variable `res`. Since `i` was initially set to 3 and must be less than or equal to 1000, its value remains unchanged. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are also unchanged as they were randomly assigned integers between 1 and 9. Therefore, the only change is that `res` is now `'none'`.
