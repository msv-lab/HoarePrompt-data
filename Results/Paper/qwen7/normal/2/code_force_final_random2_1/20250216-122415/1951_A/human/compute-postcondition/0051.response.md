Based on the initial state provided:

- `results` is an empty list.
- During the loop iterations, `r` will take the value of each element in `results`.

Since `results` is initially an empty list, there are no elements in it. Therefore, during the loop iterations, `r` will never get assigned any value because there are no elements to iterate over.

Thus, the print statement `print(r)` will attempt to print the value of `r`, but since `r` is never assigned a value in this scenario, it will print `None` (the default value for an unassigned variable in Python).

Output: **None**
