Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not match the problem description. The problem description asks for a program that generates `.ac.py` and `.wa.py` files for each `.html` file found in subfolders whose names are within a specified numeric range. However, the given program `func_1()` is designed to process input strings and print 'YES' or 'NO' based on certain conditions, which is unrelated to the task described. Therefore, the given program is incorrect for the provided problem description.
