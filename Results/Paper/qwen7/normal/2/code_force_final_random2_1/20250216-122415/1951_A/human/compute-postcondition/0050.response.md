To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects mentioned in the loop head. The loop head includes `r` and `results`.

Given the conditions and the nature of the loop, the initial state of `results` is crucial. Since the loop runs `t` times and the conditions to append 'yes' are not met, the loop will append 'no' to `results` for each iteration. Therefore, the initial state of `results` should reflect this behavior.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **Variable `r`:** This variable is used to iterate over the elements in `results`. Initially, `r` will take the value of the first element in `results`, then the second, and so on until the last element.
2. **List `results`:** This list is initialized to an empty list and will be populated with values ('yes' or 'no') during the loop iterations.

Since the loop will append 'no' to `results` for each iteration, the initial state of `results` should be an empty list. As the loop progresses, `r` will take the value of each 'no' added to `results`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `results` should be an empty list initially.
- `r` will take the value of each element in `results` during the loop iterations.

State: **`results` is an empty list, `r` will take the value of each element in `results` during the loop iterations.**
