The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to filter folder names that are digits within a specified range where 'start' and 'end' are integers such that start <= end. However, since the function does not take any parameters, it implies that the filtering logic might be applied to some predefined or externally provided list of folder names.

Functionality: **The function filters folder names that are digits within a specified range (start to end) without accepting any parameters.**
