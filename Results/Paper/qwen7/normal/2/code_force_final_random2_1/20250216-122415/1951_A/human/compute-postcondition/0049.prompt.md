You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and end are integers such that start <= end, and both start and end are used to filter folder names which should be digits within the specified range.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        cnt1 = s.count('1')
        
        if cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        elif cnt1 > 2 and (cnt1 % 2 == 1 or cnt1 == 1):
            print('NO')
        elif '11' in s:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: `t` is a positive integer minus the total number of iterations, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `n` is the integer input by the user for the last iteration, `s` is the new input string from the user for the last iteration, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in the string `s` for the last iteration. If `cnt1` > 2 and `cnt1` is even, no changes are made to the variables. If `cnt1` > 2 and `cnt1` is odd or `cnt1` == 1, no changes are made to the variables. If `'11'` is found in `s`, no changes are made to the variables. If none of the above conditions are met, no changes are made to the variables.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function filters folder names that are digits within a specified range (start to end) without accepting any parameters.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
