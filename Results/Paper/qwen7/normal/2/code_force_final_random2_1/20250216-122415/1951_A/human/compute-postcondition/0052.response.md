Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `r` which iterates over the elements of `results`.

2. **Determine the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `results` is an empty list, and `r` takes the value of each element in `results` during the loop iterations.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one element in `results` for `r` to iterate over. Since `results` is currently an empty list, there are no elements for `r` to take.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: To allow the loop to execute one more time, `results` must contain at least one element. Therefore, we need to add at least one element to `results`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `results` now contains at least one element, and `r` will take the value of that element.

**Answer**:
State: **`results` is a list containing at least one element, `r` will take the value of that element**
