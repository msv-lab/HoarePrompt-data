Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The `results` list will contain a series of 'no' and 'yes' based on the conditions checked within the loop for each iteration. Specifically, if for any iteration the condition `arr.count('1') == 2 and '11' in arr` is met, the result for that iteration will be 'no'. Otherwise, it will be 'yes' if the count of '1' is even, and 'no' otherwise.

Since the loop runs `t` times and based on the provided conditions, the final `results` list will be a list of length `t` where each element is determined by the conditions checked in the loop for each respective iteration. Given the constraints and the fact that the loop appends 'no' under most conditions (except when specific conditions for 'yes' are met), the final `results` list will predominantly consist of 'no'.

If `t` is 3, as per the given conditions, the `results` list after all iterations will be:

**Output State: results is ['no', 'no', 'no'].**

This means that for all three iterations, the conditions to append 'yes' were not met, so 'no' was appended each time.
Code of the loop:
for r in results:
    print(r)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `results` is an empty list, `r` will take the value of each element in `results` during the loop iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `results` is a list containing at least one element, `r` will take the value of that element

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `results` is a list containing at least two elements, `r` will take the value of the next element in the list




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
