Based on the initial state provided:

- `results` is a list containing at least two elements.
- `r` will take the value of the next element in the list after the current one.

When the code snippet `print(r)` is executed, `r` will be set to the second element of the `results` list because it takes the value of the next element in the list.

Output: **the second element of the results list**
