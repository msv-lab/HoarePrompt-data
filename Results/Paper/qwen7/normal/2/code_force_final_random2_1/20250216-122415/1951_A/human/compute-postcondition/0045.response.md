Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer minus 2, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `n` is the integer input by the user, `s` is the new input string from the user, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in the string `s`. If `cnt1` > 2 and (`cnt1` % 2 == 1 or `cnt1` == 1), no changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, if `'11'` is found in `s`, no changes are made to the variables. If neither condition is met, no changes are made to the variables.**
