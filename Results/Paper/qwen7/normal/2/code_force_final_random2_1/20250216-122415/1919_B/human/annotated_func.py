#State of the program right berfore the function call: expression is a string of length n consisting of characters "+" and "-", and length is an integer such that 1 <= length <= 5000.
def func_1(expression, length):
    count = 0
    for char in expression:
        if char == '+':
            count += 1
        
    #State: The value of `count` will be the total number of '+' characters in the string `expression`.
    sub = length - count
    return abs(sub - count)
    #The program returns the absolute value of the difference between the difference between the length of the string 'expression' and the total number of '+' characters in it, and the total number of '+' characters in it.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `expression` consisting of "+" and "-" characters and an integer `length`. It counts the number of "+" characters in the string, calculates the number of "-" characters as the difference between `length` and the count of "+", and returns the absolute value of the difference between these two counts.
