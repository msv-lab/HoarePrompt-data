Output State: **The value of `count` will be the total number of '+' characters in the string `expression`.**

Natural Language Description: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `count` will hold the total number of '+' characters found in the entire string `expression`. This means that for every '+' character processed during the loop, `count` was incremented by 1, resulting in `count` being equal to the sum of all '+' characters in `expression`.
