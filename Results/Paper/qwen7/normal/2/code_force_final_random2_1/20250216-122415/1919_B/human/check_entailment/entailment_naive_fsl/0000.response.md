Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty according to the problem description. The function `func_1` simply counts the number of '+' characters and calculates the difference between the total length and the count of '+' characters. This approach does not consider the optimal way to split the array into subarrays to minimize the penalty.

For example, consider the input:
```
10
--+++++++-
```
The program would output:
```
0
```
However, the optimal split would be `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])`, which results in a penalty of `0 + 0 + 0 = 0`. The program, however, calculates the difference between the number of '-' and '+' characters, which in this case is `7 - 3 = 4`, leading to an incorrect result.

Therefore, the program does not handle the problem correctly and is incorrect.
