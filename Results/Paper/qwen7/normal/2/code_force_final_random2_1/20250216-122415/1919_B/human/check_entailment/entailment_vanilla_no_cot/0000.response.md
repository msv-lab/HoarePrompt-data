Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the penalty as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty based on the optimal splitting of the array `a`. The current implementation simply counts the number of '+' characters and calculates a difference between the total length and this count, which does not account for the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.

To solve this problem correctly, one would need to consider all possible ways to split the array and calculate the penalty for each split, then choose the split with the minimum penalty. This likely involves dynamic programming or a similar approach to ensure all possibilities are considered.
