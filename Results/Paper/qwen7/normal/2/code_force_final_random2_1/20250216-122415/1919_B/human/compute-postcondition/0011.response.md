Output State: **`count` is either 2 or 3, `expression` is a non-empty string, `char` is the third character in the string `expression`**

Explanation: The value of `count` is incremented by 1, so if it was initially 1, it becomes 2, and if it was initially 2, it becomes 3. The values of `expression` and `char` remain unchanged.
