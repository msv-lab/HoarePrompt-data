### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step.

#### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input**: A string `s` of length `n` consisting of '+' and '-' characters.
2. **Array Representation**: Convert `s` into an array `a` where `a_i = 1` if `s_i = '+'` and `a_i = -1` if `s_i = '-'`.
3. **Penalty Calculation**:
   - Split `a` into non-empty subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k`.
   - Calculate the penalty for each subarray `b_i` as `p(b_i) = |sum(b_i)| * len(b_i)`.
   - The total penalty is the sum of penalties of all subarrays.
4. **Optimal Split**: Find the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting `a`.

#### Given Program:
```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    length = int(input())
    expression = input().strip()
    print(func_1(expression, length))

def func_1(expression, length):
    count = 0
    for char in expression:
        if char == '+':
            count += 1
    sub = length - count
    return abs(sub - count)
```

#### Function Summary:
- The function `func_1` counts the number of '+' characters in the string `expression`.
- It calculates the number of '-' characters as `length - count` of '+' characters.
- It returns the absolute value of the difference between these two counts (`abs(sub - count)`).

#### Evaluation:
1. **Incorrect Approach**: The function `func_1` does not consider the optimal way to split the array into subarrays to minimize the penalty. Instead, it only counts the number of '+' and '-' characters and calculates the difference between them.
2. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input `10 --+++++++-`, the program outputs `0`.
     - The function counts 3 '+' and 7 '-', so `sub = 7 - 3 = 4`.
     - The result is `abs(4 - 3) = 1`, which is incorrect.
   - The optimal split should be `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])`, resulting in a penalty of `0 + 0 + 0 = 0`.

Given the analysis, the program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not account for the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not follow the optimal strategy to minimize the penalty.
