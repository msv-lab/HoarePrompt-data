Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `char` which iterates over each character in the string `expression`.

2. **Understand the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition is that `count` is either 0 or 1, depending on whether the first character `char` in the non-empty string `expression` is '+'.

3. **Determine the Next Character**: For the loop to execute one more time, the next character `char` needs to be identified. Since the loop iterates through each character in `expression`, the next character `char` will be the second character in the string `expression`.

4. **Adjust the State**: The state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `char` to the next character in the string `expression`. The other variables (`count`, `expression`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `count` remains as it is (either 0 or 1).
- `expression` remains the same.
- `char` changes to the next character in the string `expression`.

Since the previous iteration determined the value of `count` based on the first character, for the next iteration, `char` will be the second character in the string `expression`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`count` is either 0 or 1, `expression` is a non-empty string, `char` is the second character in the string `expression`**.
