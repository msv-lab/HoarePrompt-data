Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.**

Explanation: The code `s = input()` reads a string from the input and assigns it to the variable `s`. Since the initial state specifies that `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000, after executing the code, `s` will hold the input string which maintains these properties.
