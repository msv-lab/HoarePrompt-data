Reasoning:
1. The program correctly computes the balance of the prefix for each character in the input string `s`.
2. It appends these balances along with the negative indices and characters to the `details` list.
3. The `details` list is then sorted based on the balance values (in ascending order) and the negative indices (in descending order to break ties).
4. Finally, it constructs the result string by concatenating the characters from the sorted `details` list and prints it.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the function matches the definition of the balanced shuffle operation. Therefore, the program correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
