Based on the initial state provided:

- `balance` is explicitly given as 0.
- `details` is a sorted list of tuples. Since no specific tuples are mentioned, we cannot determine the exact content of `details`.
- `result` is a string created by joining the characters from the tuples in `details`.

Given this information, the `print(result)` statement will print the string `result`, which is derived from concatenating the characters from the tuples in the `details` list.

Output: **result (where result is a string formed by concatenating characters from the tuples in the sorted list details)**
