Output State: **`balance` is 0, `details` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple consists of the current `balance`, the negative index `-i`, and the corresponding character `char` from the string `s`.**

Explanation: The `details.sort()` method sorts the `details` list in place based on the first element of each tuple (the balance). Since the original `balance` was 0 and each opening parenthesis '(' increases the balance while each closing parenthesis ')' decreases it, the final `balance` remains 0. The `details` list contains tuples representing the balance at each step, the negative index of the character, and the character itself. Sorting this list means that the order of the tuples changes, but the values within each tuple remain the same. The exact contents of `details` depend on the content of `s`, but it will include one tuple per character in `s`, and these tuples are now sorted by their balance values.
