Output State: **`balance` is 1, `details` is an empty list, `s` must contain at least one character, `i` is 0, `char` is the first character in `s`.**

Explanation: The code `balance += 1` increments the value of `balance` by 1. Initially, `balance` is 0, so after executing this line, `balance` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
