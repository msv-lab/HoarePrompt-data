Output State: **`balance` is either 1 or -1, `details` is a list containing one tuple (`balance`, -`i`, `char`), `s` must contain at least one character, `i` is 0, `char` is the first character in `s` that is either '(', or a character other than '('.**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple to the `details` list. The tuple contains the current value of `balance`, the value `-i` (which is `0` since `i` is `0`), and the value of `char`. Since `balance` is either `1` or `-1`, `details` now contains a single tuple with these values. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
