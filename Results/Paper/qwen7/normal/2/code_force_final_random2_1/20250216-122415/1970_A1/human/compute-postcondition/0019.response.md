Output State: **`balance` is 3, `details` is a list containing two tuples \[(2, -1, char), (3, -1, char)\], `s` must contain at least one character, `i` is 2, `char` is the third character in `s` that is either '(', or a character other than '('**

Explanation: The code `balance += 1` increments the value of `balance` by 1. Initially, `balance` is either 2 or 0. After incrementing, `balance` becomes 3. The other variables (`details`, `s`, `i`, and `char`) remain unchanged.
