Postcondition: **`balance` is either 2 or 0, `details` is a list containing one tuple (`balance`, -1, `char`), `s` must contain at least one character, `i` is 1, `char` is the second character in `s` that is either '(', or a character other than '('**.

This means that after executing the if-else block, `balance` will be either 2 or 0 depending on whether the character `char` is '('. The list `details` will always contain one tuple with `balance` as the first element, -1 as the second element, and `char` as the third element. The string `s` will still contain at least one character, and `i` will remain 1. The character `char` will be the second character in `s` and can either be '(' or any other character except '('
