Output State: **`balance` is 2, `details` is a list containing one tuple (2, -1, `char`), `s` must contain at least one character, `i` is 1, `char` is the second character in `s` that is either '(', or a character other than '('**

Explanation: The code `balance += 1` increments the value of `balance` by 1. Given that `balance` was initially either 1 or -1, after the increment, `balance` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
