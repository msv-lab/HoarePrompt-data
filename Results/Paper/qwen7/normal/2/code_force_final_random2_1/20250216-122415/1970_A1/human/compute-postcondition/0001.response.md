Output State: **`balance` is 0**

Explanation: The variable `balance` is initialized to 0. Since the initial state of `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence, the number of opening parentheses "(" is equal to the number of closing parentheses ")", which means that after processing the entire string `s`, the balance remains 0. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
