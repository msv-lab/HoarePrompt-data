Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described. Specifically, the sorting step is flawed. The program sorts the details based on the balance and position, but it should sort based on the balance in ascending order and in case of a tie, sort by position in descending order. However, the current implementation uses `-i` for sorting by position, which will sort in ascending order instead of descending order.

To fix this, the sorting should be modified to correctly handle the position in descending order. Here is the corrected version of the sorting part:

```python
details.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]), reverse=True)
```

With this correction, the program will correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.
