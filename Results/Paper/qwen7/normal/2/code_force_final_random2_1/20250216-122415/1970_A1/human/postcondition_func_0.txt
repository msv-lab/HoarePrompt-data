The function accepts a string `s` consisting of balanced parentheses and processes it to form a new string `result`. This new string is constructed by rearranging the characters of `s` based on their balance value during traversal. Specifically, it sorts the characters according to their balance values and their positions in the original string, then concatenates them in the sorted order. The function prints the resulting string and does not return any value.
