Output State: **`balance` is 0, `details` is a list containing one tuple (`balance`, -1, `char`), `s` must contain at least one character, `i` is 1, `char` is the second character in `s` that is either '(', or a character other than '('**

Explanation: The code `balance -= 1` decrements the value of `balance` by 1. Given that `balance` was initially either 1 or -1, after executing this line, `balance` will be 0 (since 1 - 1 = 0 and -1 - 1 = -2, but -2 does not fit the given initial state, so it must have been 1). All other variables remain unchanged according to the provided initial state.
