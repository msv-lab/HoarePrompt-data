Reasoning:
1. The provided program attempts to simulate a Quidditch game where players move and score points by throwing the Quaffle into the opposing team's goal.
2. The program correctly initializes the field and parses the initial state, including players, goals, and the Quaffle.
3. The program processes each action step-by-step, updating the positions of players and checking for scoring conditions.
4. However, there is a critical error in the `func_1` function. The function should update the coordinates based on the movement direction but instead incorrectly returns the sum of the coordinates rather than the new position.

Specifically, the `func_1` function should update the coordinates as follows:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
```
But the current implementation is:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
# The last line should be: return x + dx, y + dy
```
However, the last line is already correct. The issue lies in the comment, which incorrectly describes the function's behavior.

Given the provided code, the function `func_1` is actually correct in its implementation, but the comment is misleading. The rest of the program logic appears to be correct as well.

Therefore, the overall correctness of the program is determined by the logic and implementation of the main parts of the program, not just the function comment.

Correctness: **True**
