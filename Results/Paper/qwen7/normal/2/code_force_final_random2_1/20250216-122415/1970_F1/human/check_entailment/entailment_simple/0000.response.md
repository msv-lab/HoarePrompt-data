Reasoning:
1. **Field Representation and Initialization**: The field is correctly initialized with the dimensions \(N\) and \(M\), and the players, goals, and Quaffle are correctly identified and stored.
2. **Movement Function**: The `func_1` function correctly calculates the new position of a player based on the direction of movement. However, there is a mistake in the return statement: it should return `(x + dx, y + dy)` instead of `x + y, y + y`.
3. **Action Processing**: The program correctly processes each action. It updates the player's position based on the movement instructions and checks if a player has scored a goal. If a player scores, it prints the appropriate message and updates the score.
4. **Final Score Calculation**: After processing all actions, the program correctly prints the final score.

Given these points, the primary issue is in the `func_1` function, where the return statement is incorrect. However, the overall logic and flow of the program are correct.

Correctness: **False**

The program would still work correctly if the `func_1` function was fixed to return the correct tuple. Here is the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
```

With this correction, the program would be fully correct.
