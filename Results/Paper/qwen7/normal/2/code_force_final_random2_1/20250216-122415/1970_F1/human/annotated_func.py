#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers representing the dimensions N and M of the field, respectively, such that 3 ≤ a, b ≤ 99 and both a and b are odd. The field is represented as a list of strings, where each string contains b characters, and the entire field is a list of a such strings. The field contains goals for two teams (RG for Red goal, BG for Blue goal), players (R0-R9 for Red team, B0-B9 for Blue team), and exactly one Quaffle (.Q). The number of steps T is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000, and a list of actions is provided, where each action is a string describing the movement or interaction of an entity on the field.
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns x + y, y + y
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are tuples containing two integers. These integers represent coordinates on a field. The function calculates and returns the sum of the first coordinates (`x + dx`) and the sum of the second coordinates (`y + dy`).
