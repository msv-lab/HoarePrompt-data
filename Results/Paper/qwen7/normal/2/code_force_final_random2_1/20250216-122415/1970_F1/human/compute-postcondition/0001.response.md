Output State: **`a` is equal to `x`, `b` is equal to `y`, `dx` is equal to `y`, `dy` is equal to `y`**.

Explanation: The code `dx, dy = b` unpacks the tuple `b` into the variables `dx` and `dy`. Since `b` is equal to `y`, both `dx` and `dy` will be assigned the value of `y`. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
