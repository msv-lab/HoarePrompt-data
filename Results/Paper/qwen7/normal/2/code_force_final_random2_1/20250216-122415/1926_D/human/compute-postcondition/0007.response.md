Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `dic` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is equal to `n`, `check` is 2147483647.**

The code assigns the value \(2^{31} - 1\) to the variable `check`. This value is a constant and does not depend on any other variable's value. Therefore, `check` is set to 2147483647. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
