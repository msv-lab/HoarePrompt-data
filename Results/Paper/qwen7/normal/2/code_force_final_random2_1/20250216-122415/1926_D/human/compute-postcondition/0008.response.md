Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is iterating over the elements in the list `data`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since `i` is being assigned values from the list `data` during each iteration, the initial value of `i` is not specified in the loop head itself. However, we know that `i` will take on the values from the list `data` starting from the first element.

3. **Determine the initial state of `data`**: The list `data` is obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer. Therefore, `data` must contain at least one integer for the loop to execute.

4. **Consider other variables**: The variables `n`, `dic`, `ans`, and `check` are not directly involved in the loop head. Their values do not affect whether the loop can execute based on the given loop head.

Given these points, the only variables that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `i` and `data`.

- `i` should be set to the first element of `data`.
- `data` must contain at least one element.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

**State: `i` is the first element of `data`, `data` must contain at least one element**
