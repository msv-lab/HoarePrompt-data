Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `num` is an integer between \(k\) and \(2k\).
- `i` is \(k-1\).
- `c` is the first integer from the input split.
- `r` is the second integer from the input split.
- `m` is `n - num`.
- `m` is not equal to 0, and currently, the value of `m` is 1.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(1)
```

This `print` statement simply outputs the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
