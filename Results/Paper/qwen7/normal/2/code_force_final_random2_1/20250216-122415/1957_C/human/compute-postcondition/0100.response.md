Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the value `k`. The loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i < k`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`**: According to the given state, `i` is initially set to `k - 1`.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `k`. Given that `i` starts at `k - 1`, the loop will execute as long as `k - 1 < k`, which is always true.

4. **Adjust the State**: Since `i` starts at `k - 1`, the loop will execute once (when `i` is 0) because `k - 1 < k` is true. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `i` itself, but we need to ensure that `k` is correctly set and that `i` starts at `k - 1`.

5. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`num`, `m`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `c`, and `r`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and their values do not affect the loop execution based on the given information.

Based on this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `i` starts at `k - 1` and `k` is correctly set.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is `k - 1`, `k` must be a valid integer**
