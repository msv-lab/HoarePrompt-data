Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(3, m + 1)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `dp[6]` is `(dp[5] + 10 * dp[4] * 2) % 1000000007`
   - `i` is 6

3. **Understand the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `m + 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently 6, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 7, and `m` must be such that `7 < m + 1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented from 6 to 7.
   - `m` must be greater than 6 (since `i` starts from 3 and goes up to `m + 1`).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`dp[6]` is `(dp[5] + 10 * dp[4] * 2) % 1000000007, i` is 7, `m` must be greater than 7**
