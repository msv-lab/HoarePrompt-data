Output State: The final state of `dp` will be a list of length `m + 1` where each element is calculated according to the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` for every index `i` from 3 to `m`. All elements before index 3 will retain their initial values: `dp[0] = 0`, `dp[1] = 1`, and `dp[2] = 3`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the `dp` list will contain the computed values based on the given recurrence relation starting from `i = 3` up to `i = m`, with all previous values initialized as specified.
