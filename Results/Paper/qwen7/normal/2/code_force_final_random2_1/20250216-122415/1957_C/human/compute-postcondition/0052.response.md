Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is an integer between `k` and `2k`, `i` is `k - 1`, `c` is the first integer from the input split, `r` is the second integer from the input split, `m` is `n - num`, `n` is now the first integer from the input split, `k` is now the second integer from the input split.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `n` and `k` are updated to the values of the first and second integers from the input split, while the rest of the variables retain their previous states.
