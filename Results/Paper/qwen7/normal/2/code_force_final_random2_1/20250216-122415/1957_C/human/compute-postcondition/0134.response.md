Output State: **`dp[i]` is `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`, `i` (which is `k`) must be at least 3, `m + 1` must be greater than or equal to `k`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp[i]` using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. The conditions for `i` and `m + 1` remain unchanged as they are preconditions that are still valid after the code execution.
