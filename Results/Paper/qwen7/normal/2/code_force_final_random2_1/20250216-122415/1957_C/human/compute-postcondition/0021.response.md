Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is either 3 or 4, `i` is 3, `c` is the first integer from the input split, `r` is the second integer from the input split, `c` and `r` are integers obtained from splitting the input by space.**

Explanation: The variable `num` is incremented by 1. Given that `num` was either 2 or 3, after executing `num += 1`, `num` becomes either 3 or 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
