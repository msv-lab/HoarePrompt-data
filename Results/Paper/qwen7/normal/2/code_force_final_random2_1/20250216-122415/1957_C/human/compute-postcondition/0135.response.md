Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and the condition for the loop to continue is `i` ranging from 3 to `m + 1`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `dp[i]` is calculated as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`
   - `i` is the current value of the loop variable at the end of the previous iteration.

3. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The calculation for `dp[i+1]` will depend on the values of `dp[i]` and `dp[i-1]` from the previous iteration.

Given that the loop starts from `3` and goes up to `m + 1`, if the loop just finished an iteration where `i` was `k`, then for the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

So, let's assume `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration. For the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `dp[i]` will be calculated based on the previous values of `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]`.
- `i` will be incremented by 1.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration, let's denote it as `k`. Thus, for the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

State: **`dp[i]` is calculated as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)` with `i` being `k + 1`, where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.**

To provide a concrete example, if `i` was `5` at the end of the previous iteration, then for the next iteration, `i` will be `6`.

State: **`dp[i]` is calculated as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)` with `i` being `6`.**

In general form, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`dp[i]` is calculated as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)` with `i` being `i + 1`.**
