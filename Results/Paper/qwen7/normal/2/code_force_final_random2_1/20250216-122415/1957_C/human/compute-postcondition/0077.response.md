Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `k - 1`
- `num` is the total number of times `c` equals `r` plus twice the number of times `c` does not equal `r`
- `m` is 0
- `c` and `r` are the last integers read from input during the loop

The `print(0)` statement simply prints the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
