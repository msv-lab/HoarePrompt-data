Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is 3 (since it was initially either 1 or 2 and then incremented by 2), `i` is 2, `c` is the first integer from the input split, `r` is the second integer from the input split.**

In this output state, the variable `num` has been incremented by 2, making it either 3 if it was initially 1 or 4 if it was initially 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
