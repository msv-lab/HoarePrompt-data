Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be `k - 1`, `num` will be the total number of times `c` equals `r` plus twice the number of times `c` does not equal `r`, and `c` and `r` will be the last integers read from input during the loop.**

This output state describes the final conditions of the variables after the loop completes all its iterations. The variable `i` will be decremented to `k - 1` because it starts at `k - 1` and increments by 1 each iteration until it reaches 0. The variable `num` will hold the cumulative count of how many times `c` equals `r` (each such occurrence increases `num` by 1) and how many times `c` does not equal `r` (each such occurrence increases `num` by 2). The variables `c` and `r` will contain the values of the last pair of integers read from input during the loop's final iteration.
