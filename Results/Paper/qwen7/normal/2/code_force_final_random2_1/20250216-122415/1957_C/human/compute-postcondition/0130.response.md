Output State: **`i` is `k`, `c` is the integer entered by the user first, `r` is the integer entered by the user second, `num` is the total count of operations performed based on the conditions inside the loop, `m` is `n - num`, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` containing `0`s, and `m` is not equal to 1.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `dp` with `0` for each index from `0` to `m` (inclusive). This means `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` filled with zeros. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
