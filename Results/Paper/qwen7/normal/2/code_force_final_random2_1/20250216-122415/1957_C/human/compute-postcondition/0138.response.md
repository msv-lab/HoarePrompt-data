Output State: **`dp[i]` is calculated as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp[i]` using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. This means that the new value of `dp[i]` is determined based on the previous two elements in the `dp` array (`dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]`). The initial state of `dp[i]` being calculated as the given expression is now the current state. All other variables remain in their initial state, and the modulus operation ensures that the value of `dp[i]` does not exceed \(10^9 + 7\).
