Output State: **`i` is `k - 1`, `num` is the total number of times `c` equals `r` plus twice the number of times `c` does not equal `r`, `m` is either 0 or `n - num`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` and `k` are newly assigned values from the input, and `c` and `r` are the last integers read from input during the loop.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads two integers from the input, splits them by space, and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The values of `i`, `num`, `m`, `t`, `c`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial state.
