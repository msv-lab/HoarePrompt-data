Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. This part is handled correctly.

2. **Variable Initialization**: The variables `n`, `k`, `num`, `c`, `r`, and `m` are initialized and updated as expected. The variable `num` counts the number of diagonal placements (where `c == r`), and `m` calculates the remaining number of non-diagonal placements.

3. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of configurations for the remaining non-diagonal placements. The base cases (`dp[1]` and `dp[2]`) are set correctly, and the recurrence relation is applied correctly for values of `m` greater than 2.

4. **Modulo Operation**: The program ensures that all calculations are taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is necessary to handle large numbers.

5. **Output**: The program prints the correct number of configurations for each test case.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct according to the problem statement and the provided example.

Correctness: **True**
