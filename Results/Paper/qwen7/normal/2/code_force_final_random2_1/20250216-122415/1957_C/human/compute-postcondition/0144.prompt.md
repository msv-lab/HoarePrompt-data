Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and we have read one integer input which is assigned to `t`.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    num = 0
    for i in range(k):
        c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if c == r:
            num += 1
        else:
            num += 2
    m = n - num
    if m == 0:
        print(0)
    elif m == 1:
        print(1)
    else:
        dp = [(0) for i in range(m + 1)]
        dp[1] = 1
        dp[2] = 3
        for i in range(3, m + 1):
            dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
        print(dp[m])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is an integer between \(k\) and \(2k\), `i` is \(k-1\), `c` is the first integer from the input split, `r` is the second integer from the input split, `m` is `n - num`. If `m == 0`, then `m` remains 0. Otherwise, if `m == 1`, then `m` is set to 1. Otherwise, the list `dp` will be updated such that `dp[i]` for every `i` from 3 to `m` inclusive will be calculated using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)`, and `i` will be equal to `m`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `c`, `r`, `m`) will retain their values as they were after the last iteration of the loop.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is `k - 1`, `num` is the total number of times `c` equals `r` plus twice the number of times `c` does not equal `r`, `m` is either 0 or `n - num`, `c` and `r` are the last integers read from input during the loop, and after the loop completes, if `m` is 0, the value of `dp[m]` is `(dp[m-1] + (m-1) * dp[m-2] * 2) % 1000000007`. Otherwise, the value of `dp[m]` is `(dp[m-1] + (m-1) * dp[m-2] * 2) % 1000000007` with `m` being the final value reached, which is greater than 7.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is `k`, `c` is the integer entered by the user first, `r` is the integer entered by the user second, `num` is the total count of operations performed based on the conditions inside the loop, `m` is `n - num`. If `m` is 0, then `m` remains 0. Otherwise, `m` is either 1 or a value such that `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element `dp[i]` (for i from 1 to m) is computed as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)` for all i from 3 to m.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
