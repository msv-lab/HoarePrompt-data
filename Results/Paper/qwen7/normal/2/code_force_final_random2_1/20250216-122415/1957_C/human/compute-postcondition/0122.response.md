Output State: **`i` is `k`, `c` is the integer entered by the user first, `r` is the integer entered by the user second, `num` is the total count of operations performed based on the conditions inside the loop, `m` is `n - num`.**

The code assigns the value of `n - num` to `m`. The values of `i`, `c`, `r`, and `num` remain unchanged from their initial states.
