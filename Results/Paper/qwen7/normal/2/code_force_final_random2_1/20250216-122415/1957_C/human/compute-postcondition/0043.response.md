Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `m + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is at least 4.
   - `m` is at least 3 and not equal to 0 or 1.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `num` is an integer between `k` and \(2k\).
   - `c` is the first integer from the input split.
   - `r` is the second integer from the input split.
   - `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0.
   - `dp[1]` is set to 1.
   - `dp[2]` is set to 3.
   - `dp[i]` is updated to \((dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7)\).

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i` being at least 4, and it increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 5.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `m + 1`. Therefore, `m` must be at least 6.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `m`.

**State:**
- `i` is 5.
- `m` is at least 6.
- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `num` is an integer between `k` and \(2k\).
- `c` is the first integer from the input split.
- `r` is the second integer from the input split.
- `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0.
- `dp[1]` is set to 1.
- `dp[2]` is set to 3.
- `dp[3]` is updated to \((dp[2] + (2) * dp[1] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7)\).

However, since the exact value of `dp[3]` is not provided, we will keep it as part of the state but note that it has been updated according to the loop logic.

**Final State:**
State: **`i` is 5, `m` is at least 6, `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is an integer between `k` and \(2k\), `c` is the first integer from the input split, `r` is the second integer from the input split, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is 0, `dp[1]` is set to 1, `dp[2]` is set to 3, `dp[3]` is updated to \((dp[2] + (2) * dp[1] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7)\)**
