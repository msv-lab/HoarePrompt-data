Postcondition: **`i` is `k`, `c` is the integer entered by the user first, `r` is the integer entered by the user second, `num` is the total count of operations performed based on the conditions inside the loop, `m` is `n - num`. If `m` is 0, then `m` remains 0. Otherwise, `m` is either 1 or a value such that `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element `dp[i]` (for i from 1 to m) is computed as `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)` for all i from 3 to m.**
