Output State: **`i` is `k`, `c` is the integer entered by the user first, `r` is the integer entered by the user second, `num` is the total count of operations performed based on the conditions inside the loop, `m` is `n - num`, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` containing `0`s, `dp[1]` is set to `1`, `dp[2]` is `3`.**

Explanation: The code `dp[2] = 3` sets the value of `dp[2]` to `3`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
