Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is either 3, 4, or 5, `i` is 3, `c` is the first integer from the input split, `r` is the second integer from the input split.**

This postcondition summarizes all possible outcomes after the if-else block executes. If `c == r`, then `num` remains either 3 or 4. Otherwise, `num` is incremented to 5.
