Output State: **`i` is `k - 1`, `num` is the total number of times `c` equals `r` plus twice the number of times `c` does not equal `r`, `m` is `n - num`, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros, `c` and `r` are the last integers read from input during the loop, `m` is not equal to 0, `m` is not equal to 1.**

The code initializes a list `dp` with `m + 1` elements, all set to 0. This operation does not affect the values of `i`, `num`, `m`, `c`, or `r`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
