Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(k)`. The variables involved here are `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: According to the postcondition given, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `k - 1`.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i < k`. Since `i` is currently `k - 1`, the next value of `i` will be `k`.

4. **Adjust the state**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `k`.

Given these steps, we can now formulate the new state.

**State:**
- `i` is `k` (since it was `k - 1` and it will be incremented by 1).
- `c` remains the same as it was not modified within the loop.
- `r` remains the same as it was not modified within the loop.
- `num` remains the same as it was not modified within the loop.

So, the updated state is:

State: **`i` is `k`, `c` is the first integer from the input split by space, `r` is the second integer from the input split by space, and `num` is either `c + 2` if `c` equals `r`, or `num + 3` if `c` does not equal `r`.**
