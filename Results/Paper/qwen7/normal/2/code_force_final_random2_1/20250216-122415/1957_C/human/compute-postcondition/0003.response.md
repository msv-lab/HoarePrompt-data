Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

The code splits the input into two integers `n` and `k` using `map(int, input().split(' '))`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still holds an integer value within the specified range.
