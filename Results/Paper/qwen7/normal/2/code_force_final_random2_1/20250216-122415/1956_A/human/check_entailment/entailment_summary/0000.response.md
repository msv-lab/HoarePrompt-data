Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Function `func_1` Implementation**: The function `func_1` is defined to handle the logic for determining the number of winners based on the input parameters `a` and `b`. However, the implementation of `func_1` does not match the requirements of the problem. Specifically, it does not account for the sequence of indices to be removed from the players and the process of skipping players if their index exceeds the current number of players remaining.

2. **Main Loop Logic**: The main loop reads the input and calls `func_1` with the first element of `k_wali_list` and each element of `q_wali_list`. This approach is flawed because `func_1` is not designed to handle the sequence-based removal of players as described in the problem statement.

3. **Sequence-Based Removal**: The problem requires removing players based on the sequence `a_1, a_2, ..., a_k` and handling the scenario where the sequence index exceeds the current number of players. The provided `func_1` does not perform these operations.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
