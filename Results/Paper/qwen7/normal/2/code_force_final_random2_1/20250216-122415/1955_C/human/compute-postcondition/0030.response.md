The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged. The conditions and values of the variables specified in the initial state are still valid.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i in range 1 to n, `l` is equal to `r` - 1, `r` is n - 2, `sunks` is equal to 2, and `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, and `a[r]` is 0.**
