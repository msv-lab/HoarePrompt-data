Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i in range 1 to n, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is n - 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is within. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement itself, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged. The condition mentioned in the postcondition about `k` being greater than or equal to `a[r]` leading to breaking out of the loop also remains valid as the `break` statement does not alter these conditions.
