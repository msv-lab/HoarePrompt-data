Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) in range 1 to \(n\), `l` and `r` are adjusted based on the conditions (`l` is `r-2` or `r-1`, `r` is `n-3` or `n-2`), `sunks` is increased by 1 or 2, `k` is reduced by `2 * a[r]`, and `a[r]` is modified based on the conditions (reduced by `a[l]` or `2 * a[l]`), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `k == 0`, otherwise the program continues as usual.**

In this output state, the value of `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[r]`. All other variables remain in their previously described states, with `a[r]` potentially being modified based on the conditions involving `a[l]`.
