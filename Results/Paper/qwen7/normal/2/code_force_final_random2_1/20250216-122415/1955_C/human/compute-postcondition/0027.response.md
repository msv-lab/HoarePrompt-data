Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i in range 1 to n, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is n - 2, `sunks` is equal to 1, `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, and `a[r]` is 0.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. If `a[r]` equals 0, the postcondition reflects the changes specified in the if part, setting `r` to `n - 2`, `sunks` to 1, and ensuring `a[r]` is 0. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change if the condition `a[r] == 0` is not met.
