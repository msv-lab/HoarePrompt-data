Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i in range 1 to n, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is n - 1, `sunks` is `sunks` + 1, and `l` and `r` must remain equal to n - 1.**

Explanation: The variable `sunks` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their original values or conditions.
