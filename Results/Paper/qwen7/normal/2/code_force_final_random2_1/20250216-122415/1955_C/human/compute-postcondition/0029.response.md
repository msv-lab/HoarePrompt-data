Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i in range 1 to n, `l` is equal to `r` - 1, `r` is n - 2, `sunks` is equal to 2, and `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, and `a[r]` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `l` is incremented by 1, changing its value from `r` (which was `n - 2`) to `r - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
