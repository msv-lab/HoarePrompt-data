Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i in range 1 to n, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is n - 1, `sunks` is either 0 or 1, `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, and `a[r]` is decreased by `a[l]`.**

Explanation: The code `a[r] -= a[l]` decreases the value of `a[r]` by the value of `a[l]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
