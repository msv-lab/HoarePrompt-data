Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i in range 1 to n, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is n - 1, `k` is decreased by 2 times the value of `a[l]`, and `a[r]` is reduced by `a[l]`.**

Explanation: The code `a[r] -= a[l]` subtracts the value of `a[l]` from `a[r]`. Given that `l` is equal to `r`, and `r` is `n - 1`, it means `l` is also `n - 1`. So, `a[n-1]` is reduced by `a[n-1]`, resulting in `a[n-1]` being set to 0. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
