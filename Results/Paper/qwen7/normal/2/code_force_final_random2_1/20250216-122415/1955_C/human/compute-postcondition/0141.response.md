Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) in range 1 to \(n\), `l` is now `r-3`, `r` is now `n-3`, `sunks` is now `sunks + 1`, `k` is now `k - 2 * a[l] - 2 * a[r]`, `a[r]` is now `a[r] - a[l] - a[l]`**

Explanation: 
- The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1.
- Initially, `r` was `n-2`, so after decrementing, `r` becomes `n-3`.
- `l` is updated to `r-2`, which means `l` is now `r-3` (or `n-5`).
- The value of `k` is updated to `k - 2 * a[l]`, and since `r` is now `n-3`, `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - a[l]`.
