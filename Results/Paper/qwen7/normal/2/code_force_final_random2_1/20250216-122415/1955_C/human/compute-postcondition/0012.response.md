Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i in range 1 to n, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is n - 1, `sunks` is 1, and either `k` is less than `a[r]` (in which case the value of `sunks` remains 0) or `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
