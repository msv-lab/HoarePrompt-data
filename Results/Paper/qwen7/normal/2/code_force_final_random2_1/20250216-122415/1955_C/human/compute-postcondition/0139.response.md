Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) in range 1 to \(n\), `l` is now `r-2`, `r` is now `n-2`, `sunks` is increased by 1 to `sunks + 1`, `k` is decreased by `2 * a[l]`, `a[r]` is reduced by `a[l]`**

Explanation: The code `a[r] -= a[l]` subtracts the value of `a[l]` from `a[r]`. Given the initial conditions, `l` is `r-2` and `r` is `n-2`. So, `a[n-2]` is reduced by `a[r-2]`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the provided code snippet.
