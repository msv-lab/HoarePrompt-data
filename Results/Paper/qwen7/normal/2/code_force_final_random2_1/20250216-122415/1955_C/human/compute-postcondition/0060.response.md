Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i in range 1 to n, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is n - 2, `sunks` is 2, `a[l]` is 0, `k` is now k - 2 * a[r], `l` is increased by 1, and `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Initially, `r` was equal to `n - 1`. After decrementing, `r` becomes `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
