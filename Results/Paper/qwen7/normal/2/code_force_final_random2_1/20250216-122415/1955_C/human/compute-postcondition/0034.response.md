Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i in range 1 to n, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is n - 1, `sunks` is either 0 or 1 plus 1, and `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`, and `k` is less than `a[l] * 2` and equals `a[l] * 2 - 1`.**

In simpler terms, `sunks` is now `1` (since it was either `0` or `1` and it was incremented by `1`). All other conditions and values remain the same as the initial state.
