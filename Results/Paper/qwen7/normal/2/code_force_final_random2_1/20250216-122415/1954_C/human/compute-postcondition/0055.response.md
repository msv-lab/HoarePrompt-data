Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(len(a))`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `len(a)`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is given as `i` is 0. This means that `i` has just completed its first iteration.

3. **Understand the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(a)`. Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` would be 1. Therefore, `len(a)` must be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the state**: Based on the above points, we need to update the state such that `i` is 1 and `len(a)` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `len(a)` must be greater than 1**
