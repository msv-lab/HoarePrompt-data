Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `len(a)`.
2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < len(a)`.
3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `i` is 1.
   - `len(a)` must be greater than 1.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.
   - The condition `len(a) > 1` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 2.
- `len(a)` must still be greater than 1.

So, the final state is:
State: **`i` is 2, `len(a)` must be greater than 1**
