Postcondition: `f` is 0, `x` is a string representing an integer, `y` is a string representing an integer, `a` is a list of characters from the string `x` with one pair of elements swapped (specifically, `a[i]` and `b[i]`), `b` is a list of characters input by the user, the length of `a` is at least 1, `i` is 0, and after executing the if-else block, if `a[i]` is now less than `b[i]`, then `a[i]` and `b[i]` have been swapped such that `a[i]` is less than `b[i]`. If `a[i]` is not less than `b[i]`, no swap occurs.
