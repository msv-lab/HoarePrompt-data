#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are strings representing integers of the same length, consisting of digits from 1 to 9.
def func_1():
    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())
    f = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if f == 0:
            if a[i] < b[i]:
                a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
                f = 1
            elif a[i] > b[i]:
                f = 1
        elif a[i] > b[i]:
            a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `f` is 1, `x` is a string representing an integer, `y` is a string representing an integer, `a` is a list of characters from the string `x` where at most one pair of elements has been swapped, `b` is a list of characters input by the user, and `i` is the index of the last iteration of the loop. The value of `f` remains 1 because the loop continues as long as `f` is 1, indicating that there was at least one swap during the loop's execution. The list `a` will have at most one pair of elements swapped compared to the corresponding elements in `b`, based on the conditions specified in the loop.
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, and `len(a)` must be greater than 0.
    #
    #In natural language: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `a` minus one, meaning it has iterated through every element in the list. Additionally, the length of the list `a` must be greater than 0 for the loop to have executed even once.
    print()
    #This is printed: ""
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
        
    #State: `i` is equal to `len(b) - 1`, and `len(b)` must be greater than 0.
    print()
    #This is printed: nothing
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes two strings `x` and `y` as input, each representing an integer of the same length. It then compares the corresponding digits of these strings. If a digit in `x` is smaller than the corresponding digit in `y`, it swaps them. This process continues until either no more swaps are needed or the end of the strings is reached. After the comparisons, it prints the modified string `x` followed by the original string `y`. The function does not return any value.
