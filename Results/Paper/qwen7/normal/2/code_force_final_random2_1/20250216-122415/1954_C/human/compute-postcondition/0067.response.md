Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state tells us that `i` is 2.
2. `b` is a list, but no explicit values are given for it. We only know that `len(b)` must be greater than 0, meaning `b` contains at least one element.
3. The print statement accesses `b[i]`, where `i` is 2. This means we need to look at the third element of the list `b`.

Given these conditions, the print statement will attempt to print the third element of the list `b`.

Output: **b[2]**
