Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `len(b)`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < len(b)`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: `i` is 1, `len(b)` must be greater than 0.
4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 2 in the next iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `len(b)` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 2
- `len(b)` must still be greater than 0

So, the updated state is:
State: **`i` is 2, `len(b)` must be greater than 0**
