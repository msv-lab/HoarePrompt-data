Functionality: **The function takes two strings `x` and `y` as input, each representing an integer of the same length. It then compares the corresponding digits of these strings. If a digit in `x` is smaller than the corresponding digit in `y`, it swaps them. This process continues until either no more swaps are needed or the end of the strings is reached. After the comparisons, it prints the modified string `x` followed by the original string `y`. The function does not return any value.**
