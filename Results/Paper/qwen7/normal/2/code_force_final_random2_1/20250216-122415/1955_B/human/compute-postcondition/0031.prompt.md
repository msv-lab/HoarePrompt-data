Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, and `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 ≤ l[i] ≤ 10^9 for all i; `li` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for k in range(0, n):
    for h in range(0, n):
        li.append(a + k * c + d * h)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `k` is 0, `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive, `h` is 3 (or any value from 0 to n-1), `li` is a list containing the values `a + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `k` remains 0, `n` still must be between 2 and 500 inclusive, `h` will be the last value it was set to, which can be any value from 0 to `n-1`. The list `li` will contain `n` elements, starting from `a` and increasing by `d` for each subsequent element, so the list will be `[a, a+d, a+2d, ..., a+(n-1)d]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `k` is equal to `n`, `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive, `h` is `n-1`, `li` is a list containing the values `a + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, and `li` has been fully populated with `n` elements, each calculated as `a + k * c + d * h`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `k` will be equal to `n`, meaning the loop has executed `n` times. The variable `h` will be `n-1`, indicating it has gone through all values from 0 to `n-1`. The list `li` will contain `n` elements, each calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The list `li` will contain `n` elements, each calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
