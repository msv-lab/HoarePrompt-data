Output State: **`h` is 1, `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive, `k` is 1, `li` is a list containing the values `a + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`, and `li` has appended the value `a + k * c + d * h`.**

Explanation: The code `li.append(a + k * c + d * h)` appends a new value to the list `li`. Given the previous state, `h` is 1, `k` is 1, and `c` is not specified but assumed to be a constant. The value appended to `li` is `a + k * c + d * h`, which simplifies to `a + 1 * c + d * 1` or `a + c + d`. The list `li` now contains the original sequence plus this new value. All other variables remain unchanged.
