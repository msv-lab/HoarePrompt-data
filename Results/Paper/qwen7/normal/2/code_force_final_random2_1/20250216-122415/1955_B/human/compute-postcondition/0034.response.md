The code `l.sort()` sorts the list `li`. Given that `li` is already defined as a sorted list of `n` elements, each calculated as `a + n * c, a + (n-1) * c + d, a + (n-2) * c + 2d, ..., a + d * (n-1)`, sorting it again does not change its order since it was already sorted. Therefore, the values of `k`, `n`, `h`, and `li` remain the same.

Output State: **`k` is equal to `n`, `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive, `h` is equal to `n-1`, `li` is a sorted list containing `n` elements, each calculated as `a + n * c, a + (n-1) * c + d, a + (n-2) * c + 2d, ..., a + d * (n-1)`**
