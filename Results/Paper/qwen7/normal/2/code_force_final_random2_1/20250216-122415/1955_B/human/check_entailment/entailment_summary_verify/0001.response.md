### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description and Requirements:**
   - The problem involves verifying if a given array `l` can form a progressive square with specified parameters `n`, `c`, and `d`.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to generate the expected sequence of numbers for the progressive square and compare it with the given array `l`.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - **Finding the Minimum Value:**
     - The function correctly finds the minimum value `a` in the array `l`.
   - **Generating the Expected Sequence:**
     - The function generates the expected sequence `li` using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` where `k` and `h` range from `0` to `n-1`.
     - This formula correctly represents the elements of a progressive square.
   - **Sorting and Comparison:**
     - Both the generated sequence `li` and the input array `l` are sorted.
     - The function then compares the sorted sequences.
     - If the sorted sequences match, it returns `'yes'`; otherwise, it returns `'no'`.

3. **Potential Issues:**
   - **Range of Values:**
     - The function assumes that the values in the array `l` will always be within the range `[1, 10^9]`. However, the problem statement guarantees that the values are within this range, so this assumption is valid.
   - **Order of Elements:**
     - The function sorts both `l` and `li` before comparing them. This ensures that the comparison is done correctly regardless of the initial order of elements in `l`.
   - **Edge Cases:**
     - The function handles edge cases well, such as when the minimum value in `l` is used to generate the sequence.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The function correctly identifies the minimum value in the array `l`.
   - It correctly generates the expected sequence using the given formula.
   - The sorting step ensures that the comparison is done correctly regardless of the initial order of elements in `l`.
   - The comparison logic is correct and returns the appropriate result ('yes' or 'no').

Given this analysis, the program appears to be logically sound and should work as intended for the problem.
