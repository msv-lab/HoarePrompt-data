Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` is designed to check if the given list `l` can form a progressive square with the given parameters `n`, `c`, and `d`.
2. The function starts by finding the minimum value in `l` and then generates a new list `li` where each element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for `k` ranging from 0 to `n-1` and `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.
3. This generated list `li` should theoretically represent the elements of the progressive square in some order.
4. The function then sorts both `l` and `li` and checks if they are equal. If they are equal, it means the elements in `l` can indeed form a progressive square, so it returns 'yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'no'.
5. Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the function correctly identifies whether the given list `l` can form a progressive square.

Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided. The function `func_1` accurately checks if the given list `l` can form a progressive square with the specified parameters `n`, `c`, and `d`.
