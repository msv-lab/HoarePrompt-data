Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in the `func_1` function. The issue lies in how the progressive square values are generated. Specifically, the formula used to generate the progressive square values is incorrect. The formula should be \(a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1) \cdot c + (j-1) \cdot d\) for a progressive square. However, in the provided code, the formula used is \(a + k \cdot c + d \cdot h\), which does not correctly represent the progressive square generation.

Here's the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(n, c, d, l):
    a = min(l)
    li = []
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        for j in range(1, n+1):
            li.append(a + (i-1) * c + (j-1) * d)
    li.sort()
    l.sort()
    if l == li:
        return 'YES'
    return 'NO'
```

This corrected function will properly generate the progressive square values and compare them with the input list to determine if the input list can form a progressive square.
