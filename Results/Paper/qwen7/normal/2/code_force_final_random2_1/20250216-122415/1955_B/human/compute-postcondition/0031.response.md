Output State: `k` is equal to `n`, `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive, `h` is equal to `n-1`, `li` is a list containing `n` elements, each calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `k` will be equal to `n`, meaning the loop has executed `n` times. The variable `h` will be `n-1`, indicating it has gone through all values from 0 to `n-1`. The list `li` will contain `n` elements, each calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`. Therefore, the final list `li` will be `[a + d*0, a + c*n + d*1, a + 2c*n + d*2, ..., a + (n-1)*c*n + d*(n-1)]`.
