Output State: **`k` is 0, `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive, `h` is 0, `li` is a list containing the value `a + k * c + d * h` which simplifies to `a` since `k` is 0.**

In this case, the list `li` is appended with the value of `a + k * c + d * h`. Given that `k` is 0, the expression simplifies to just `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
