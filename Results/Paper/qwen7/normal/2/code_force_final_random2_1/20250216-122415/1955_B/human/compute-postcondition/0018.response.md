Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for h in range(0, n)`. The variables involved here are `h` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `h` is 2
   - `n` must be between 2 and 500 inclusive
   - `k` is 1 (not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged)
   - `li` is a list containing the values `a + d * 2`, `a + c + 2d` (not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged)

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `h` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `h` is 2. For the next iteration, `h` will be 3.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `h` must be less than `n`. Since `h` is now 3, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `h` is 3
- `n` must be greater than 3 (and still between 2 and 500 inclusive)

The final state is:
State: **`h` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
