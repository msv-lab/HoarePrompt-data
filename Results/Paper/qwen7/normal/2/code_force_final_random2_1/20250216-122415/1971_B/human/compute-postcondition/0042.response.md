Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks if the string `s` contains more than one unique character. If `s` has only one unique character, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and then either the lexicographically smallest permutation of `s` or the lexicographically largest permutation of `s`, depending on whether `s` is already sorted in ascending order.**
