Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes an integer `t` and a string `s` where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. The function does not return anything explicitly but implies processing or validating these inputs according to their constraints.**
