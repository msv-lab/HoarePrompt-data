Output State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with the last two elements removed, and `smallList` is a list of integers with the last three elements removed.**

Explanation: The code `smallList.pop()` removes the last element from `smallList`. Since `bigList` was initially described as having the last two elements removed and no operation was performed on `bigList`, its state remains unchanged. Therefore, `smallList` now has the last three elements removed instead of just the last two.
