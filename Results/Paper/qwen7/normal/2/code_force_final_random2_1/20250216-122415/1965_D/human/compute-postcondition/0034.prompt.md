You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: odds is a list of integers representing all but one of the subarray sums of a palindrome array a of size n, and n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 1000 and n is odd.
def func_3(odds, n):
    a = [0] * n
    prev = 0
    idx = (n - 1) // 2
    for x in odds:
        if idx == n - 1 - idx:
            a[idx] = x
        else:
            a[idx] = (x - prev) // 2
            a[n - 1 - idx] = (x - prev) // 2
        
        prev = x
        
        idx = idx - 1
        
    #State: Output State: The list `a` is fully populated with values based on the elements of `odds`. Specifically, for each element `x` in `odds`, the corresponding positions in `a` are updated according to the rules defined in the loop. The variable `prev` holds the last value of `x` from `odds` after the loop completes, and `idx` is decremented until it becomes -1. The list `a` is symmetric around its center because of the way the loop updates its values. All other variables (`odds`, `n`) remain as they were initially, and `idx` is no longer used after the loop.
    #
    #In more detail:
    #- `a` is filled such that for each `x` in `odds`, if `idx` equals `n - 1 - idx`, then `a[idx]` is set to `x`.
    #- Otherwise, both `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are set to `(x - prev) // 2`.
    #- After processing all elements in `odds`, `prev` will hold the last value of `x` from `odds`, and `idx` will be -1 due to the decrement operation in the loop.
    return a
    #The program returns a list `a` which is symmetric around its center, where each element is calculated based on the corresponding element in `odds`. For each element `x` in `odds`, if `idx` equals `n - 1 - idx`, then `a[idx]` is set to `x`. Otherwise, both `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are set to `(x - prev) // 2`. The list `a` is fully populated, `prev` holds the last value of `x` from `odds`, and `idx` is -1.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `odds` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a symmetric list `a` of size `n` where each element is calculated based on the corresponding element in `odds`. For each element `x` in `odds`, if the index `idx` equals `n - 1 - idx`, then `a[idx]` is set to `x`. Otherwise, both `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are set to `(x - prev) // 2`, where `prev` holds the last value of `x` from `odds` and `idx` starts at -1.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `a` which is symmetric around its center, where each element is calculated based on the corresponding element in `odds`. For each element `x` in `odds`, if `idx` equals `n - 1 - idx`, then `a[idx]` is set to `x`. Otherwise, both `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are set to `(x - prev) // 2`. The list `a` is fully populated, `prev` holds the last value of `x` from `odds`, and `idx` is -1.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
