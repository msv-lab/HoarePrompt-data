Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: bigList is a list of integers representing the complete list of subarray sums of the palindrome array a, and smallList is a list of integers representing all but one of the subarray sums of a, with the last element of bigList being the same as the last element of smallList.
Code of the loop:
while len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]:
    bigList.pop()
    smallList.pop()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `bigList` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `smallList` is a list of integers with the last element removed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `bigList` is a list of integers with the last element removed, and `smallList` is a list of integers with the last two elements removed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `bigList` is a list of integers with the last two elements removed, and `smallList` is a list of integers with the last three elements removed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
