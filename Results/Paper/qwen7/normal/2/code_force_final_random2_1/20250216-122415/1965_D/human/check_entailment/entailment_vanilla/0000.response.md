Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly recovers a possible palindrome array `a` from the given subarray sums.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1(a)`**:
   - This function computes all subarray sums of the input array `a`.
   - It iterates through all possible subarrays starting from each index `i` to the end of the array.
   - It appends the sum of each subarray to the list `cts`.
   - Finally, it sorts the list `cts`.

2. **Function `func_2(cts)`**:
   - This function aims to identify the unique subarray sums by removing duplicates.
   - It iterates through the sorted list `cts` and maintains a list `odds` of unique sums.
   - If the current sum `ct` is the same as the last element in `odds`, it removes the last element (to remove the duplicate).
   - Otherwise, it appends the current sum to `odds`.

3. **Function `func_3(odds, n)`**:
   - This function reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the unique subarray sums.
   - It initializes an array `a` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It sets the middle element (if `n` is odd) or the two middle elements (if `n` is even) based on the unique sums.
   - It fills the remaining elements symmetrically around the middle.

4. **Function `func_4(bigList, smallList)`**:
   - This function is not used in the provided solution and seems unnecessary for the problem at hand.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Function `func_1(a)`**:
   - This function correctly computes all subarray sums and sorts them. This part is correct.

2. **Function `func_2(cts)`**:
   - This function attempts to find unique subarray sums by removing duplicates. However, it does not account for the fact that some sums might appear more than twice (e.g., `[1, 1, 2]` has a subarray sum of 2 appearing three times). This function will incorrectly remove these duplicates, leading to an incomplete set of unique sums.

3. **Function `func_3(odds, n)`**:
   - This function tries to reconstruct the palindrome array using the unique subarray sums. However, without the correct set of unique sums, the reconstruction may not be accurate. The function assumes that the unique sums are sufficient to reconstruct the palindrome, which is not always true due to the issues in `func_2`.

### Conclusion:

The provided program has logical flaws, particularly in how it handles the unique subarray sums. Therefore, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: **False**
