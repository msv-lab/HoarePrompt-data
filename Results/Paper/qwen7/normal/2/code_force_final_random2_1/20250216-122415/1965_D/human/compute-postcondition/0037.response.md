Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of `a`, `j` is `len(a) + 1`, `sm` is an error or undefined, `cts` is a list containing `sm` and `sm` appended to it, which results in a list with two elements both being `sm`.**

Explanation: The code `cts.append(sm)` appends the value of `sm` to the list `cts`. Since `sm` is an error or undefined, appending it to the list `cts` results in a list with two elements, both being `sm`. The other variables remain unchanged.
