Output State: **`x` is the second element of the list `odds`, `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 1000\) and `n` is odd, `prev` is equal to `x`, `idx` is `idx - 1`.**

Explanation: The code decrements the value of `idx` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `x`, `n`, `prev`, and `idx` retain their original values, with `idx` being adjusted by subtracting 1 from its original value.
