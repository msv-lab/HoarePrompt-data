Output State: **`x` is the first element of the list `odds`, `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 1000\) and `n` is odd, `prev` is equal to `x`, `idx` is decreased by 1, `a` remains unchanged.**

The code `idx = idx - 1` decrements the value of `idx` by 1. All other variables (`x`, `n`, `prev`, and `a`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
