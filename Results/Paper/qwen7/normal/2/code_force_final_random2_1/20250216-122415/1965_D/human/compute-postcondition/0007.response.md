Output State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with the last two elements removed, and `smallList` is a list of integers with the last two elements removed.** 

Explanation: The code `bigList.pop()` removes the last element from `bigList`. Since `smallList` was already described as having its last two elements removed, the condition that `len(smallList)` must be greater than or equal to 1 remains valid. Therefore, `bigList` now has its last element removed, and `smallList` still has its last two elements removed.
