Functionality: **The function accepts a list `odds` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a symmetric list `a` of size `n` where each element is calculated based on the corresponding element in `odds`. If the current index `idx` equals the mirrored index `n - 1 - idx`, then `a[idx]` is set to the current element `x` from `odds`. Otherwise, both `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are set to half the difference between the current element `x` and the previous element `prev`. After processing all elements in `odds`, the list `a` is fully populated, `prev` holds the last value of `x` from `odds`, and `idx` is -1.**
