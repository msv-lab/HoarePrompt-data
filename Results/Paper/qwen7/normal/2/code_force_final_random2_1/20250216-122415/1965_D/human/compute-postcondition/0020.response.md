Output State: **`x` is the second element of the list `odds`, `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 1000\) and `n` is odd, `prev` is equal to `x`, `idx` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code sets `prev` to the current value of `x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `prev` is now known to be equal to `x`, but the values of `x`, `n`, `idx`, and the list `odds` remain as they were initially.
