Postcondition: `x` is the third element of the list `odds`, `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 1000\) and `n` is odd, `prev` is equal to the second element of the list `odds`, `idx` is `idx - 1`. If `idx` equals `n - 1 - idx`, then `a[idx]` is assigned the value of `x`. Otherwise, `a[n - 1 - idx]` is updated to \((x - prev) // 2\).
