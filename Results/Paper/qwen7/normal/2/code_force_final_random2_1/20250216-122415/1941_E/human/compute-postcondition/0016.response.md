Output State: **The program returns the last element of the list `row`, which has been incremented by 2 compared to its original value. All other elements in the list have been incremented by 1, with the first `d-2` elements incremented twice.**

This means that the last element (`row[-1]`) has been incremented by 2, while the rest of the elements have been incremented by 1, with the first `d-2` elements incremented an additional time, making them incremented twice in total.
