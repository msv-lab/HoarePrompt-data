Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `total_costs` is an empty list, `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` integers converted from the input split by spaces, and `costs` is a list of `n` elements, each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each row in `rows`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
    total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `total_costs` is now a list containing the sum of every `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list, `rows` remains a list of `n` lists, and `costs` remains a list of `n` elements.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of every `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list, `rows` remains a list of `n` lists, `costs` remains a list of `n` elements, `i` is `len(costs) - k`. `total_costs` has one additional element which is the sum of the last `k` elements of the `costs` list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of every `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list plus the sum of the last `k` elements, `rows` remains a list of `n` lists, `costs` remains a list of `n` elements, `i` is `len(costs) - k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
