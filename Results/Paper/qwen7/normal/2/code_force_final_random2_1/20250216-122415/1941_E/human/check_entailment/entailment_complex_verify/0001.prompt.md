You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bernard loves visiting Rudolf, but he is always running late. The problem is
that Bernard has to cross the river on a ferry. Rudolf decided to help his
friend solve this problem.

The river is a grid of n rows and m columns. The intersection of the i -th row
and the j -th column contains the number a_{i,j} — the depth in the
corresponding cell. All cells in the first and last columns correspond to the
river banks, so the depth for them is 0 .

The river may look like this.

Rudolf can choose the row (i,1), (i,2), \ldots, (i,m) and build a bridge over
it. In each cell of the row, he can install a support for the bridge. The cost
of installing a support in the cell (i,j) is a_{i,j}+1 . Supports must be
installed so that the following conditions are met:

  1. A support must be installed in cell (i,1) ; 
  2. A support must be installed in cell (i,m) ; 
  3. The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than d . The distance between supports (i, j_1) and (i, j_2) is |j_1 - j_2| - 1 . 

Building just one bridge is boring. Therefore, Rudolf decided to build k
bridges on consecutive rows of the river, that is, to choose some i (1 \le i
\le n - k + 1 ) and independently build a bridge on each of the rows i, i + 1,
\ldots, i + k - 1 . Help Rudolf minimize the total cost of installing
supports.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , m , k , and d (1
\le k \le n \le 100 , 3 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le d \le m ) — the number
of rows and columns of the field, the number of bridges, and the maximum
distance between supports.

Then follow n lines, i -th line contains m positive integers a_{i, j} (0 \le
a_{i, j} \le 10^6 , a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0 ) — the depths of the river cells.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n \cdot m for all sets of input data does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum total cost of
supports installation.

Note

In the first test case, it is most profitable to build a bridge on the second
row.

It is not a top view, but side view: gray cells — bridge itself, white cells
are empty, black cells — supports, blue cells — water, brown cells — river
bottom.

In the second test case, it is most profitable to build bridges on the second
and third rows. The supports will be placed in cells (2, 3) , (3, 2) , and on
the river banks.

In the third test case the supports can be placed along the river banks.

    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, each element in the list `row` will have been incremented by 1, except for the element at index `d-1`, which will have been incremented by 2.

    #The program returns the last element of the list `row`, which has been incremented by 2 compared to its original value. All other elements in the list have been incremented by 1, with the first `d-2` elements incremented twice.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `row` of non-negative integers and a positive integer `d`. It increments the last element of `row` by 2, increments all other elements by 1, and increments the first `d-2` elements by 1 again. The function returns the modified list.

#Function 2:

The variable `i` is set to `len(costs) - k`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `total_costs` will contain sums of all possible consecutive groups of `k` elements from the `costs` list, starting from the beginning and moving towards the end. If the `costs` list has fewer than `k` elements remaining at the end of the loop, those elements will be summed as well. The `rows` and `costs` lists remain unchanged, and `i` is set to the index just after the last group of `k` elements considered.
    print(min(total_costs))

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, along with a list `rows` of `n` lists, each containing `m` positive integers. It calculates the sum of every `k` consecutive elements from a derived list `costs`, which is itself derived from `rows` using `func_1`. The function then prints the minimum sum among these calculated values. The function returns nothing but prints the result.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to build \( k \) bridges on consecutive rows of a river grid.
   - Each bridge must have supports at both ends (columns 1 and \( m \)).
   - The distance between any two adjacent supports must be no more than \( d \).
   - We need to minimize the total cost of installing these supports.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the cost of placing supports in a single row.
   - It ensures that the cost of placing a support in each cell is minimized while maintaining the required distance between supports.
   - The logic seems to correctly place supports starting from the leftmost end and propagating the minimum cost to the right.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function processes the entire input and computes the total cost for building \( k \) bridges.
   - It reads the dimensions and the grid from input.
   - It applies `func_1` to each row to get the minimum cost for that row.
   - It then iterates over possible starting rows for the bridges and sums the costs for each set of \( k \) consecutive rows.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function correctly handles the placement of supports with the given constraints.
   - It uses a sliding window approach to find the minimum cost for placing supports in the current row.
   - The logic seems sound and should work as intended.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - The function reads the input correctly and processes each row using `func_1`.
   - It then calculates the total cost for each possible set of \( k \) consecutive rows.
   - The logic to find the minimum total cost is correct and follows the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

After reviewing the code, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` seem to correctly implement the solution to the problem. The logic for placing supports and calculating the total cost appears to be accurate.
