The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, which are all integers. Additionally, `rows` is a list containing `n` lists, where each inner list has `m` positive integers, and the first and last elements of each inner list are guaranteed to be 0.

If `k` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is less than or equal to 100, `m` is between 3 and 200000, and `d` is between 1 and `m`, the function processes the `rows` list to determine a specific value based on these parameters. The function then returns either a specific integer value or an error message if the constraints are not met.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` as integers, and a list `rows` containing `n` lists of `m` positive integers. It returns a specific integer value based on the given constraints or an error message if the constraints are not satisfied.**
