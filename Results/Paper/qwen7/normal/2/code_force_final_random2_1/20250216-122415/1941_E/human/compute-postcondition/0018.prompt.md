You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: row is a list of non-negative integers representing the depths of river cells in a row, and d is a positive integer representing the maximum allowed distance between adjacent supports.
def func_1(row, d):
    for i in range(0, d - 1):
        row[i] = row[i] + 1
        
    #State: Output State: The list `row` is a list of non-negative integers where each element has been increased by 1, except for the element at index `d-1`, which has been increased by 2; the variable `d` remains greater than 1; the final value of `i` is `d - 1`; every element in `row` from index 0 to `d-2` (inclusive) has been incremented once more due to the loop executing `d-1` times.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, each element in the list `row` will have been incremented by 1, except for the element at index `d-1`, which will have been incremented by 2. All elements from index 0 to `d-2` will have been incremented twice because the loop runs `d-1` times.
    for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):
        row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, each element in the list `row` will have been incremented by 1, except for the element at index `d-1`, which will have been incremented by 2. All elements from index 0 to `d-2` will have been incremented twice because the loop runs `d-1` times. The variable `i` will have the value `len(row) - 1`, and the variable `d` will remain greater than 1.
    #
    #In simpler terms, every element in the list `row` will have been incremented by 1, except for the last element, which will have been incremented by 2. Elements from the start of the list up to the second-to-last element will have been incremented twice.
    return row[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of the list `row`, which has been incremented by 2 compared to its original value. All other elements in the list have been incremented by 1, with the first `d-2` elements incremented twice.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `row` of non-negative integers and a positive integer `d`. It increments the last element of `row` by 2, increments all other elements by 1, and increments the first `d-2` elements by 1 again. The function returns the modified list.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the last element of the list `row`, which has been incremented by 2 compared to its original value. All other elements in the list have been incremented by 1, with the first `d-2` elements incremented twice.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
