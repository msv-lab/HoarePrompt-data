Based on the initial state provided:

- `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of every `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list, including the sum of the last `k` elements if they are available.
- `rows` remains a list of `n` lists.
- `costs` remains a list of `n` elements.
- The variable `i` is set to `len(costs) - k`.

Let's break down the process:

1. **Understanding `total_costs`:**
   - `total_costs` is constructed by summing up every `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.
   - If there are fewer than `k` elements left at the end of the `costs` list, those elements are summed as well.
   - For example, if `costs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `k = 3`, then `total_costs` would be `[6, 9]` because:
     - First sum: `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`
     - Second sum: `2 + 3 + 4 = 9`
     - Third sum: `3 + 4 + 5 = 12` (but since only two elements are left, it is not included in `total_costs`).

2. **Value of `min(total_costs)`:**
   - After constructing `total_costs`, the minimum value among the sums will be determined.
   - This minimum value is what will be printed when the `print(min(total_costs))` statement is executed.

Given this understanding, the output will be the smallest sum of any `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.

Output: **min(sum of every k consecutive elements from costs list)**
