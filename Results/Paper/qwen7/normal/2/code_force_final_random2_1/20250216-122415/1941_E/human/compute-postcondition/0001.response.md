Output State: **`rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` integers converted from the input split by spaces, and `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` retain their original input values.**

Explanation: The code reads `n` lines of input, each containing `m` space-separated integers, and stores them in the `rows` variable as a list of lists. Each inner list represents a row of the river, with the first and last elements guaranteed to be 0. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` remain unchanged and retain their original input values.
