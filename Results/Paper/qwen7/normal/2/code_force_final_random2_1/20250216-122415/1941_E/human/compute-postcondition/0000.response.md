Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces, rows is still a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` positive integers representing the depths of the river cells, and the first and last elements of each inner list are guaranteed to be 0.**

Explanation: The code reads four integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` from the input and splits them by spaces. These values replace the existing values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`. The variable `rows` remains unchanged, being a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` positive integers with the first and last elements being 0.
