You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: (n, m, k, d) are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 2 × 10^5, and 1 ≤ d ≤ m. rows is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains m positive integers representing the depths of the river cells, and the first and last elements of each inner list are guaranteed to be 0.
def func_2():
    n, m, k, d = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
    rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
    costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
    total_costs = []
    for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
        total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
        
    #State: Output State: `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of every `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list, including the sum of the last `k` elements if they are available. `rows` remains a list of `n` lists, and `costs` remains a list of `n` elements. The variable `i` is set to `len(costs) - k`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `total_costs` will contain sums of all possible consecutive groups of `k` elements from the `costs` list, starting from the beginning and moving towards the end. If the `costs` list has fewer than `k` elements remaining at the end of the loop, those elements will be summed as well. The `rows` and `costs` lists remain unchanged, and `i` is set to the index just after the last group of `k` elements considered.
    print(min(total_costs))
    #This is printed: min(sum of every k consecutive elements from costs list)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` as integers, and a list `rows` containing `n` lists of `m` positive integers. It returns a specific integer value based on the given constraints or an error message if the constraints are not satisfied.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
