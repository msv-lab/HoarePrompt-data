Functionality: **The function accepts four integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, along with a list `rows` of `n` lists, each containing `m` positive integers. It calculates the sum of every `k` consecutive elements from a derived list `costs`, which is itself derived from `rows` using `func_1`. The function then prints the minimum sum among these calculated values. The function returns nothing but prints the result.**
