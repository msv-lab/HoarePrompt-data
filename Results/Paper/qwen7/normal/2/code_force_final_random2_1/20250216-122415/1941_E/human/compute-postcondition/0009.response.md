Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `total_costs` contains the sum of every `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list, `rows` remains a list of `n` lists, `costs` remains a list of `n` elements, and `i` is `len(costs) - k`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(costs) - k`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.
   - Therefore, `i` should be updated to `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: After updating `i`, the new value of `i` should be checked against the loop condition `i < len(costs) - (k - 1)`. Since `i` is already `len(costs) - (k - 1)`, the loop will not execute again unless `k` changes or `costs` changes, but these are not mentioned to change in this context.

Given the above analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is only `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`total_costs` is a list containing the sum of every `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list, `rows` remains a list of `n` lists, `costs` remains a list of `n` elements, `i` is `len(costs) - (k - 1)`**.
