Output State: **`i` is `n`, `s` is `min(m, k)`, `k` is `k - min(m, k) - min(m, k)`, `c` is `c + min(m, k) * (l[n] + t)`, `t` is `t + min(m, k) + min(m, k)`**

Explanation: The line `s = min(m, k)` does not change the value of `s` because it is already set to `min(m, k)` in the initial state. All other variables (`i`, `k`, `c`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial values. Therefore, the output state retains the same values for all variables as they were in the initial state.
