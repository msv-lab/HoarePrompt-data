Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `k` is `k - n * s`, `c` is the sum of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration from `i=0` to `i=n-1`.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the input integer `n`. The variable `k` will be reduced by `n` times the value of `s` (where `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`). The variable `c` will hold the cumulative sum of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration from `i=0` to `i=n-1`.
