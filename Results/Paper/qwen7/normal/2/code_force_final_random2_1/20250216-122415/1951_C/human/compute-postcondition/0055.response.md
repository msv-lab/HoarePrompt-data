Output State: **`c` is `c + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `s` is the minimum of `m` and `k`, `k` is reduced by `s`**.

Explanation: The variable `c` is updated by adding the value of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` to its current value. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The condition for `n` remains unchanged, meaning `n` must still be greater than `i + 1`. The value of `s` remains the minimum of `m` and `k`. Finally, `k` is reduced by `s`.
