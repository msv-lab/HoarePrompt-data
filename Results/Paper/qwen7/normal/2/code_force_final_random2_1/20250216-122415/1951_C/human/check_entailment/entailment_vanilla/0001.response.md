Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` which represent the number of days, the maximum tickets that can be purchased per day, and the total number of tickets to be purchased.
   - It then reads a list of ticket prices for each day, `l`.

2. **Sorting the List:**
   - The list `l` is sorted in ascending order. This is crucial because we want to minimize the total cost by purchasing tickets on the days with the lowest prices first.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - Initialize variables `t` (total cost), `s` (tickets to be purchased in the current iteration), and `c` (cumulative cost).
   - Iterate through each day:
     - Determine the number of tickets to purchase (`s`) such that it does not exceed `m` and the remaining required tickets (`k`).
     - Calculate the cost for these tickets (`s * (l[i] + t)`), where `l[i]` is the price of tickets on the current day and `t` is the increase in price due to previous purchases.
     - Update the cumulative cost `c` and the total tickets purchased `t`.
     - Decrease the remaining tickets `k` by `s`.

4. **Output:**
   - Print the total cost `c`.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Sorting the List:**
   - Sorting the list of ticket prices ensures that we always buy tickets on the cheapest days first, which is a necessary step to minimize the total cost.

2. **Logic for Purchasing Tickets:**
   - The logic correctly handles the constraint that tickets can be purchased in batches up to `m` per day.
   - The logic also correctly accounts for the price increase after purchasing tickets on a particular day.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where `k` might be zero before the loop starts or when `k` is less than `m` on any given day.

4. **Test Cases:**
   - The provided test cases cover various scenarios including different values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k`. The program passes all the given test cases.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the given program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost to purchase exactly `k` tickets under the given constraints.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
