Reasoning:
1. The provided program iterates through each test case and calculates the minimum cost to purchase exactly `k` tickets over `n` days with a limit of `m` tickets per day.
2. The program sorts the list of ticket prices (`l`) before processing, which is unnecessary since it processes the list in a way that doesn't require sorting.
3. The variable `c` is initialized to `k * k / 2`. This initialization seems incorrect because it doesn't account for the actual ticket prices and the number of tickets purchased each day.
4. In the main loop, the program correctly reduces `k` by the number of tickets purchased (`s = min(m, k)`), updates the cumulative cost (`c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2`), and ensures that `k` is reduced accordingly.
5. The final output is the integer value of `c`.

However, the key issue lies in the initialization of `c`. The correct approach should involve calculating the cost based on the actual ticket prices and the number of tickets purchased each day without an initial incorrect assumption.

Given the provided logic and the example outputs, the program seems to follow the correct logic but with an incorrect initial assumption for `c`.

Correctness: **False**

To fix this, the initialization of `c` should be set to 0, and the calculation inside the loop should directly add the cost of tickets purchased each day.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        l.sort()
        
        c = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            s = min(m, k)
            k -= s
            c += l[i] * s
            
        print(int(c))
```

This corrected version initializes `c` to 0 and directly adds the cost of tickets purchased each day, ensuring the correct minimum spending is calculated.
