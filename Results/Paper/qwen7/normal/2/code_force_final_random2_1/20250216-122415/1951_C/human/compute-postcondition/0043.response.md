Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `k` is `k - n * s`, `c` is the sum of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration from `i=0` to `i=n-1`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to integer values from the input.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. This means that the values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state, and `c` remains as the sum of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration from `i=0` to `i=n-1`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are now specific integer values obtained from the input.
