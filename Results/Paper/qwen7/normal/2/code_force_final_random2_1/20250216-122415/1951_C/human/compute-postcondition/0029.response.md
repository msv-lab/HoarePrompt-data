Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is `k - s`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decreased by `s`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `s` is still the minimum value between `m` and `k`, but since `k` has been updated, `s` would now be the minimum value between `m` and the new value of `k`. However, since the exact values of `m` and `k` are not provided, we express `s` as the minimum value between `m` and `k - s`.
