Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined as `for i in range(n)`. This means the loop variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `c` is `l[0] * s - s * s / 2`
   - `k` is `k - s`

3. **Determine the state adjustments needed**:
   - Since the loop condition is `i < n`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 (from 0 to 1).
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise within the loop body, but since no such change is mentioned, `n` stays the same.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged, so it still must be greater than 0.
   - The values of `c` and `k` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted based on the loop condition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
