Output State: **`s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`; `k` is `k - s`; `c` is `c + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`**

Explanation: 
- `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`. This value does not change.
- `k` is updated to `k - s`.
- `c` is updated to `c + l[i] * s - s * s / 2`. Here, `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` is added to the current value of `c`.
