Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(n):` statement. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, the condition `i < n` must hold true.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - The expression `c = c + l[1] * s - s * s / 2` is given, but it does not affect the loop head variables directly.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2 (because `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each time).
   - The value of `n` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, as it is not modified within the loop body.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be greater than 0

The expression `c = c + l[1] * s - s * s / 2` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.

So, the final state is:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0**
