Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `k` is the third integer input.**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. The variable `i` remains unchanged and is still 0. The input values must be integers between 1 and \(10^4\), but since no specific values are provided, we only state that `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the respective integers from the input.
