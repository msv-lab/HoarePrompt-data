Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to minimize the cost by purchasing tickets in a way that does not fully account for the rules described in the problem statement. Here's a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

Consider the input:
```
3 2 5
8 6 4
```
According to the problem description, the optimal strategy would be:
- On day 1, buy 2 tickets for a total of \(2 \times 8 = 16\). Prices for the next days become [10, 8].
- On day 2, buy 2 tickets for a total of \(2 \times 10 = 20\). Prices for the next day become [14].
- On day 3, buy 1 ticket for a total of \(1 \times 14 = 14\).

The total cost would be \(16 + 20 + 14 = 50\).

However, the provided program calculates the cost as follows:
- On day 1, it buys 2 tickets for a total of \(2 \times 8 = 16\). Remaining tickets to buy: 3.
- On day 2, it buys 2 tickets for a total of \(2 \times 6 = 12\). Remaining tickets to buy: 1.
- On day 3, it buys 1 ticket for a total of \(1 \times 4 = 4\).

The total cost calculated by the program is \(16 + 12 + 4 = 32\), which is incorrect.

This example shows that the program does not correctly handle the logic of buying tickets and adjusting future prices, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
