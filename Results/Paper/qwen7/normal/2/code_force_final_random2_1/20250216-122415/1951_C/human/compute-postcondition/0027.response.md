Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `n`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i < n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 (since `range(n)` includes numbers from 0 to `n-1`).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is set to `n` at the start, and the loop will increment `i` starting from 0, `i` should be adjusted to `0` at the start of the loop.
   - `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

5. **Other variables**:
   - `c`, `k`, `l`, and `s` are not directly involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
