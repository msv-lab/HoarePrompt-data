Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `k` is `k - n * s`, `c` is the sum of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times. The variable `k` will be reduced by `n * s`, where `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k` at the start of each iteration. The variable `c` will hold the cumulative sum of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration, starting from `i=0` up to `i=n-1`.
