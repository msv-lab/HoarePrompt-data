Output State: **`mexsize` is 2, the first element of the list `a` (`sz`) is equal to 1, `tc` is `t - 1`, and `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `mexsize = mexsize + 1` increments the value of `mexsize` by 1. Since the initial value of `mexsize` is 1, after executing this line, `mexsize` becomes 2. The other variables (`a`, `sz`, `tc`, and `maxsize`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
