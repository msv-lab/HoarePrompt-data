Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers, `mexsize` will be incremented each time an element in `a` equals `mexsize`, the final value of `mexsize` will be the smallest positive integer not present in `a`, if the current value of `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, `mexsize` remains as the smallest positive integer not present in `a`, otherwise `mexsize` will be less than or equal to `maxsize`, `tc` is equal to the previous value of `tc` + 1, `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `n`. The other variables (`a`, `mexsize`, `maxsize`, and `tc`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The description of the conditions for `mexsize` and `tc` also remains the same.
