Output State: **`mexsize` is `sz` + 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, and `sz` is the first element of the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code increments `mexsize` by 1. Since `sz` was initially equal to `mexsize`, after the increment, `mexsize` becomes `sz` + 1. The list `a` remains unchanged, and `sz` remains the first element of the list `a`.
