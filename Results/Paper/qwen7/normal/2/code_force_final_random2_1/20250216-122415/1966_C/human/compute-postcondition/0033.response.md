Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop is iterating over the list `a` using the variable `sz`. Therefore, the objects in the loop head are `sz` and `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `sz`**: Since the loop starts with the first element of the list `a`, `sz` should be set to the first element of the list `a`.

3. **Determine the initial state of `a`**: The list `a` is already given as a sorted list of integers.

4. **Consider other variables**: The variables `maxsize`, `mexsize`, `tc`, and `n` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `sz` should be the first element of the list `a`.
- `a` should remain a sorted list of integers.

Therefore, the state after adjustment should be:

**State: **`sz` is the first element of the list `a`, `a` is a sorted list of integers**
