Let's break down the task step by step:

1. Identify the objects in the loop head: The loop head contains the variable `tc` and the integer `t`.
2. Determine the condition for the loop to execute: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0 because `range(t)` will generate numbers from 0 to `t-1`.
3. Adjust the state: Since `t` is the only variable that controls the loop execution and it is given that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to start executing.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
