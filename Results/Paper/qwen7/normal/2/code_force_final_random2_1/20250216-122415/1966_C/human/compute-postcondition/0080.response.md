Postcondition: **`a` is a sorted list of integers, `mexsize` is one more than the maximum value in the list `a`, `sz` is the last element of the list `a`, `tc` is `t - 1`, and `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`. If `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, `mexsize` is incremented. Otherwise, `mexsize` remains unchanged.**
