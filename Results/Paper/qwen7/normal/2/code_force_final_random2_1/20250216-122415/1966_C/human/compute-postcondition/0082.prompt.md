Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
Code of the loop:
for tc in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    maxsize = max(a)
    a.sort()
    mexsize = 1
    for sz in a:
        if sz == mexsize:
            mexsize = mexsize + 1
    if mexsize > maxsize:
        print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 0 else 'Bob')
    else:
        print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 1 else 'Bob')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations of the loop, `a` will still be a sorted list of integers, and `mexsize` will be incremented each time an element in `a` equals `mexsize`. The final value of `mexsize` will be the smallest positive integer not present in `a`. If the current value of `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, `mexsize` remains as the smallest positive integer not present in `a`. Otherwise, `mexsize` will be less than or equal to `maxsize`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `mexsize` is incremented for each element in the list `a` that matches its current value of `mexsize`. The final value of `mexsize` is one more than the last element in the list `a` if all elements in `a` match their respective `mexsize` values during the loop iterations. The list `a` remains a sorted list of integers, and `sz` is the last element of the list `a`. Whether `mexsize` is greater than or less than or equal to `maxsize`, the above conditions hold true.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is a sorted list of integers, `mexsize` is one more than the maximum value in the list `a`, `sz` is the last element of the list `a`, `tc` is `t - 1`, and `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`. If `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, `mexsize` is incremented. Otherwise, `mexsize` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
