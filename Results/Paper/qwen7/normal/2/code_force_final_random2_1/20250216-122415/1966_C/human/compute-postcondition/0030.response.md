Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `mexsize` remains as the smallest positive integer not present in `a`, `tc` is equal to the previous value of `tc` + 1, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code assigns the maximum value in the list `a` to the variable `maxsize`. The other variables (`mexsize`, `tc`, and `n`) remain unchanged. The list `a` is already sorted and its maximum value is now stored in `maxsize`.
