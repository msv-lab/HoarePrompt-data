Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers, `mexsize` is incremented for each element in the list `a` that matches its current value of `mexsize`, the final value of `mexsize` is one more than the last element in the list `a` if all elements in `a` match their respective `mexsize` values during the loop iterations, `sz` is the last element of the list `a`, and `tc` is `t - 1`; `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The sorting operation does not affect the values of `mexsize`, `sz`, `tc`, or `maxsize`. The conditions related to `mexsize` and `sz` remain unchanged as they are based on the original list before sorting. Therefore, the output state includes the updated list `a` which is now sorted, and the unchanged variables `mexsize`, `sz`, `tc`, and `maxsize`.
