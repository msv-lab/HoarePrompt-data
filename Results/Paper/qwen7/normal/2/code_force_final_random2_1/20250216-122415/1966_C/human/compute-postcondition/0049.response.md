Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `mexsize` is incremented for each element in the list `a` that matches its current value of `mexsize`.
   - The final value of `mexsize` is one more than the last element in the list `a` if all elements in `a` match their respective `mexsize` values during the loop iterations.
   - `sz` is the last element of the list `a`.
   - The current value of `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 0 else 'Bob')
   ```

Given the conditions:
- Since `mexsize` is incremented for each element in the list `a` that matches its current value of `mexsize`, and it ends up being one more than the last element in the list `a`, this implies that all elements in `a` matched their respective `mexsize` values during the loop iterations.
- Therefore, `mexsize` is one more than the last element in the list `a`, i.e., `mexsize = sz + 1`.
- We are also given that the current value of `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, so `mexsize > maxsize`.

To determine the output, we need to check if `mexsize % 2 == 0`:
- If `mexsize` is even, the output will be `'Alice'`.
- If `mexsize` is odd, the output will be `'Bob'`.

Since `mexsize = sz + 1` and `sz` is the last element in the list `a`, `mexsize` is always odd because it is one more than an integer (`sz`).

Therefore, `mexsize % 2 == 1` (which is equivalent to `mexsize % 2 != 0`), and the output will be `'Bob'`.

Output: **Bob**
