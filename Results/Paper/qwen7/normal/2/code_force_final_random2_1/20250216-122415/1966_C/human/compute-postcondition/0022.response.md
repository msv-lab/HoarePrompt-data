Postcondition: **After all iterations of the loop, `a` will still be a sorted list of integers, and `mexsize` will be incremented each time an element in `a` equals `mexsize`. The final value of `mexsize` will be the smallest positive integer not present in `a`. The current value of `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`.**
