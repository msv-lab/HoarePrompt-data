Postcondition: **`mexsize` will be incremented for each element in the list `a` that matches its current value of `mexsize`. The final value of `mexsize` will be one more than the last element in the list `a` if all elements in `a` match their respective `mexsize` values during the loop iterations. The list `a` remains a sorted list of integers, and `sz` will be the last element of the list `a` after the loop completes. `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`**
