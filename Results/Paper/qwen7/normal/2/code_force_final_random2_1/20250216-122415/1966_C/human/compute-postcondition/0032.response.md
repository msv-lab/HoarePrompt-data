Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `mexsize` is 1, `tc` is equal to the previous value of `tc` + 1, `n` is an input integer, and `a` is sorted.**

Explanation: The line `mexsize = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `mexsize`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
