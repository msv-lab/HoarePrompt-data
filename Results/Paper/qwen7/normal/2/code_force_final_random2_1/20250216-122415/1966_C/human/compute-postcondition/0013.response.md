Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `sz` and `a`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element `sz` in the list `a`.
3. **Determine the postcondition**: After the loop, the postcondition is that `a` must contain at least one element. Additionally, if the size of `a` is equal to `mexsize + 1`, then `mexsize` is increased by 1.

Given these points, let's analyze the state at the start of the next iteration:

- **Variable `sz`**: This variable is used to iterate over elements in `a`. It is not modified within the loop, so its value does not change from the previous iteration.
- **Variable `a`**: The size of `a` could potentially change depending on the loop body. However, the postcondition requires that `a` must contain at least one element.
- **Variable `mexsize`**: This variable is only incremented if the size of `a` is equal to `mexsize + 1`. Since the loop continues as long as `a` contains at least one element, `mexsize` remains unchanged unless the condition is met.

Since the loop continues as long as `a` contains at least one element, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the size of `a`.

**State at the start of the next iteration**:
- `a` must contain at least one element.
- `mexsize` remains unchanged unless the size of `a` is exactly `mexsize + 1`.

However, since the loop continues as long as `a` contains at least one element, we can simplify the state to just ensuring `a` contains at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` must contain at least one element**
