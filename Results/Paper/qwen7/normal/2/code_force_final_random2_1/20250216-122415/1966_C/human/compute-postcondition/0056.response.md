Output State: **`a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `mexsize` is incremented for each element in the list `a` that matches its current value of `mexsize`, the final value of `mexsize` is one more than the last element in the list `a` if all elements in `a` match their respective `mexsize` values during the loop iterations, the list `a` remains a sorted list of integers, `sz` is the last element of the list `a`, and `tc` is `t - 1`.**

Explanation: The code reads a list of integers from input using `map(int, input().split())` and assigns it to the variable `a`. This means that `a` now contains the list of integers entered by the user. The other variables (`mexsize`, `sz`, and `tc`) remain unchanged in terms of their described properties, but the value of `a` is updated. The conditions regarding `mexsize`, `sz`, and `tc` are preserved as stated in the initial state.
