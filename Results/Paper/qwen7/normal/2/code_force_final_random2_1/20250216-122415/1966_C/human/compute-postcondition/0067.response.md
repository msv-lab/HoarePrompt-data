Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for sz in a:`. The only variable in the loop head is `sz`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions**:
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element.
   - `mexsize` is 2.
   - `sz` is 1.
   - `tc` is `t - 1`.
   - `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`.

3. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `sz` is 1.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `sz` is being iterated over each element in `a`, the next value of `sz` will be the next element in the list `a`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `sz` should be an element of `a`.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `sz` will be updated to the next element in the list `a`.
   - All other variables (`a`, `mexsize`, `tc`, `maxsize`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

**State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `mexsize` is 2, `sz` is the next element in the list `a`, `tc` is `t - 1`, and `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`**.
