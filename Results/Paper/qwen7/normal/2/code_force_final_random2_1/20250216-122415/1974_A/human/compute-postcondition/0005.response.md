Output State: **`t` is now `b`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `a` is an integer from the first input split, `b` is an integer from the second input split.**

Explanation: The code `t = b` assigns the value of `b` to `t`. All other variables (`n`, `i`, `a`) remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, `t` is updated to `b`, while the conditions and values of `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` (as an input split) are preserved.
