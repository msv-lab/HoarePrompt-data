State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. For the loop to execute, the condition `n > 0` must be true because `range(n)` will generate a sequence from 0 to `n-1`.
3. At the start of the loop, the variable `i` should be set to 0, as `range(n)` starts counting from 0.
4. The variable `t` is not directly involved in the loop's execution condition and its value (within the given range) does not affect whether the loop runs or not.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be 0.
