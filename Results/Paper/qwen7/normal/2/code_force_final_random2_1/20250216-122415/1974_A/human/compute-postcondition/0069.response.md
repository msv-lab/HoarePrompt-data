Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and pairs of non-negative integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99). For each test case, it performs some unspecified operation and returns the results accordingly.**

Given the constraints and the lack of specific operation details, the function likely iterates over `t` test cases, processes each pair of `x` and `y`, and returns the outcomes of these operations. However, without more details on the operations to be performed on `x` and `y`, the exact nature of the return values cannot be specified.
