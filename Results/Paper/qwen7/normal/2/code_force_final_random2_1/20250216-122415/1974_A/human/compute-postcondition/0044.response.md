Output State: **`t1` is either 0 or 30, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is the integer value of the first word from the input split, `b` is the integer value of the variable `b`, `t` is equal to `b`, `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t2` is `a - t1`, `t` is `t + (t2 // 15) + 1**.

Explanation: 
- `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`.
- `t` is updated to `t + (t2 // 15) + 1`. Since `t2` is `a - t1`, the new value of `t` is `b + (a - t1) // 15 + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
