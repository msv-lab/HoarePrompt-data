Reasoning:
Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Initial Adjustment of `t`**: 
   - `t` is initialized to `b`, which represents the number of 2x2 icons.
   - If `t` is even, `t` is divided by 2. If `t` is odd, `t` is divided by 2 and then incremented by 1. This adjustment accounts for the space taken up by 2x2 icons on the grid.
3. **Calculation of `t1`**:
   - `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`. This formula seems to be an attempt to calculate the remaining space available after placing the 2x2 icons, but it does not seem to align with the actual problem requirements. The calculation `t * 15` suggests that each screen has 15 cells, but this is not explicitly stated in the problem description.
4. **Adjustment Based on Remaining Space**:
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, `t` remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates how many additional screens are needed to accommodate the remaining 1x1 icons (`a - t1`) and adds these to `t`.

Given the problem statement, the key points are:
- Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
- Each 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell.
- Each screen has 5 rows and 3 columns, so each screen has 15 cells.

The program's logic for calculating `t1` and adjusting `t` based on the remaining space does not correctly reflect the problem constraints. Specifically, the calculation `t * 15 - b * 4` is incorrect because it does not account for the actual number of cells available on the screen.

The correct approach would involve:
1. Calculating the total number of cells required for both types of icons.
2. Dividing this total by 15 (the number of cells per screen) to determine the minimum number of screens needed.

Since the program's logic does not correctly implement the solution, it will produce incorrect results for some test cases.

Correctness: **False**
