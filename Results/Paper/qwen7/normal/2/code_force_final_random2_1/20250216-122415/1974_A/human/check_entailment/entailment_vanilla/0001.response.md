Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, where `a` is the number of 1x1 icons and `b` is the number of 2x2 icons.

2. **Calculating Minimum Screens for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The variable `t` is initialized to `b`.
   - If `b` is even, `t` is divided by 2.
   - If `b` is odd, `t` is divided by 2 and then incremented by 1. This ensures that `t` correctly accounts for the number of 2x2 icons that need to be placed, considering they occupy 4 cells each.

3. **Calculating Remaining Space After Placing 2x2 Icons**:
   - `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`. Here, `15` is the total number of cells available on one screen, and `4` is the number of cells occupied by each 2x2 icon.
   - This calculation determines how many 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining space after placing all 2x2 icons.

4. **Checking if Remaining 1x1 Icons Fit**:
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then no additional screens are needed, and `t` remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, the remaining 1x1 icons (`a - t1`) are checked to see how many more screens are needed. Each additional screen can hold up to 15 icons.
   - The number of additional screens required is calculated as `t2 // 15 + 1` if there is any remainder (`t2 % 15 != 0`).

5. **Outputting the Result**:
   - The final value of `t` is printed, which represents the minimum number of screens needed.

### Testing with Examples

Let's test the program with the provided examples to verify its correctness.

#### Example 1:
- Input: `1 1`
- Calculation:
  - `t = 1` (since `1` is odd, `t = 1 // 2 + 1 = 1`)
  - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11`
  - `t1 >= 1` is true, so `t` remains `1`.
- Output: `1` (Correct)

#### Example 2:
- Input: `7 2`
- Calculation:
  - `t = 2` (since `2` is even, `t = 2 // 2 = 1`)
  - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 7`
  - `t1 >= 7` is true, so `t` remains `1`.
- Output: `1` (Correct)

#### Example 3:
- Input: `12 4`
- Calculation:
  - `t = 4` (since `4` is even, `t = 4 // 2 = 2`)
  - `t1 = 2 * 15 - 4 * 4 = 22`
  - `t1 >= 12` is true, so `t` remains `2`.
- Output: `2` (Correct)

#### Example 4:
- Input: `0 3`
- Calculation:
  - `t = 3` (since `3` is odd, `t = 3 // 2 + 1 = 2`)
  - `t1 = 2 * 15 - 3 * 4 = 18`
  - `t1 >= 0` is true, so `t` remains `2`.
- Output: `2` (Correct)

#### Example 5:
- Input: `1 0`
- Calculation:
  - `t = 0` (since `0` is even, `t = 0 // 2 = 0`)
  - `t1 = 0 * 15 - 0 * 4 = 0`
  - `t1 >= 1` is false, so `t2 = 1 - 0 = 1`, and `t = 0 + 1 // 15 + 1 = 1`.
- Output: `1` (Correct)
