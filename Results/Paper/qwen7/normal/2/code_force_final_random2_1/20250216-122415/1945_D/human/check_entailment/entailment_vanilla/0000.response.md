Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires us to find the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to ensure he is among the first `m` people in the queue. We need to consider the costs associated with swapping positions with people in front of him.

### Key Points to Consider

1. **Costs**: 
   - Swapping with the person at position `j` (where `j < i`) costs `a_j`.
   - For each person between `j` and `i`, it costs `b_k`.

2. **Objective**: Minimize the total cost while ensuring Kirill ends up in one of the first `m` positions.

### Given Program Analysis

#### Function `func_1()`

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - Reads `n` and `k` from input.
   - Reads lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` and reverses them.

2. **Initialization**:
   - Initializes `soma_b` and `pref` to 0.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - Iterates from `0` to `n - k - 1`:
     - If `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`, it updates `pref` and resets `soma_b`.
     - Otherwise, it adds `lista_B[i]` to `soma_b`.

4. **Result Calculation**:
   - Iterates from `n - k` to `n - 1`:
     - Updates the result with the minimum value of `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]`.
     - Adds `lista_B[i]` to `soma_b`.

5. **Output**:
   - Prints the minimum cost.

#### Function `func_2()`

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - Reads the number of test cases.

2. **Loop Over Test Cases**:
   - Calls `func_1()` for each test case.

### Correctness Check

1. **Reversing Lists**:
   - Reversing the lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` is unnecessary because the problem does not specify any specific order for processing elements.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The logic for updating `pref` and `soma_b` seems to be incorrect. It should consider the cumulative cost of swaps and the cost of moving Kirill to the desired position.

3. **Result Calculation**:
   - The result calculation part seems to be missing the cumulative cost of swaps correctly.

### Correct Solution

To correctly solve the problem, we need to maintain a cumulative cost of swaps and ensure we update the minimum cost appropriately.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    lista_A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_B = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Initialize the cost array
    cost = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        cost[i] = cost[i + 1] + lista_B[i]
    
    # Initialize the minimum cost
    min_cost = float('inf')
    
    # Calculate the minimum cost
    for i in range(n - k + 1, n + 1):
        current_cost = cost[i] + min(cost[j] + lista_A[j] for j in range(i - k, i))
        min_cost = min(min_cost, current_cost)
    
    print(min_cost)

def func_2():
    numero_testes = int(input())
    for _ in range(numero_testes):
        func_1()

# Call the main function
func_2()
```

### Conclusion

The given program has logical errors and does not correctly calculate the minimum cost. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: **False**
