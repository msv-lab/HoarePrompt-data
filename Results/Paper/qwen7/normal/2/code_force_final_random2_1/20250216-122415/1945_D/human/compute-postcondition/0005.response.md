The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` (which is typically an underscore used as a throwaway variable) and `numero_testes`. Since the underscore is just a placeholder and does not hold any state, we only need to consider `numero_testes`.

According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as `numero_testes` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `func_1()` has been called again, but this does not provide information about `numero_testes`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `numero_testes` is still greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`func_1()` has been called again, `numero_testes` must be greater than 0**
