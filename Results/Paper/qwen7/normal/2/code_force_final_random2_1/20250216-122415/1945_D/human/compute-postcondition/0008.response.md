Output State: `func_1()` has been called `numero_testes` times.

Explanation: Since the loop runs `numero_testes` times and `func_1()` is called in each iteration, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `func_1()` will have been called exactly `numero_testes` times. The value of `numero_testes` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once, as stated in the given conditions. Therefore, after all iterations, `func_1()` will have been called `numero_testes` times.
