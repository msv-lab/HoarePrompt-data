Output State: **`resultado` is the minimum of `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]`, `i` is `n - k - 1`, `n - k` is 0, `soma_b` is the sum of all elements in `lista_B`, and `i` is less than or equal to `n - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `resultado` is updated to be the minimum of its current value (`infinity`) and the expression `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]`.
- Given that `i` is `n - k - 1` and `n - k` is 0, we can deduce that `i` is `-1`.
- Since `i` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`, this condition is satisfied.
- The values of `soma_b` and `pref` remain unchanged from their initial states.
