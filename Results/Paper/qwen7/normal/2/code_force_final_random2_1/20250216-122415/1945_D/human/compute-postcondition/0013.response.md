Output State: **`i` is 0, `n - k` is a positive integer, and the element at index `i` of `lista_A` is greater than or equal to the element at index `i` of `lista_B`; `soma_b` is the sum of the element at index `i` of `lista_B`.**

Explanation: The code updates `soma_b` by adding the element at index `i` of `lista_B` to its current value. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, and the element at index `i` of `lista_A` is greater than or equal to the element at index `i` of `lista_B`. Since no other changes are made to the variables, the output state includes the updated value of `soma_b` and retains the other initial conditions.
