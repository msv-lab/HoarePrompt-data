Output State: **`i` is 1 or 2, `n - k` is a positive integer, `soma_b` is the sum of elements from `lista_B` up to the index `i-1` (0 or 1), `pref` is updated by adding `soma_b` to its current value.**

In this output state, the value of `i` remains either 1 or 2, the value of `n - k` remains a positive integer, and `soma_b` remains the sum of elements from `lista_B` up to the index `i-1` (which is 0 or 1). The variable `pref` is updated by adding `soma_b` to its current value.
