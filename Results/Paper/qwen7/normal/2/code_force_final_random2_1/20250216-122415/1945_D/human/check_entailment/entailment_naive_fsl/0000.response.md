Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not properly handle the conditions specified in the problem description.

The problem requires finding the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` positions in the queue. However, the current implementation does not correctly calculate the costs for moving Kirill to different positions. Instead, it seems to be attempting to reverse the lists and then calculate some form of prefix sums, which is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following example:

### Example:
- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  4 2
  7 3 6 9
  4 3 8 5
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  - The minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first 2 positions is calculated as follows:
    - Moving from position 4 to position 3: Cost = 5 (b_3)
    - Moving from position 3 to position 2: Cost = 3 (b_2)
    - Moving from position 2 to position 1: Cost = 3 (a_1)
    - Total cost = 5 + 3 + 3 = 11

- **Actual Output:**
  - The provided solution outputs 14, which is incorrect.

The provided solution does not correctly account for the costs associated with each move and does not ensure that the minimum cost is calculated accurately. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
