Output State: `func_1()` has been called `numero_testes` times.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `func_1()` will have been called exactly `numero_testes` times. This means that the function `func_1()` is called once for each value of `numero_testes`, which is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
