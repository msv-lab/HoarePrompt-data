Output State: **`i` is 1, `n - k` is 0, `soma_b` is equal to `lista_B[0]`, `resultado` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and (pref + `lista_B[0] + lista_A[0]`).**

Explanation: The code `soma_b += lista_B[i]` increments `soma_b` by the value of `lista_B[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `soma_b` is updated to be `lista_B[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
