### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the given program has logical errors and does not correctly calculate the minimum cost. Let's break down the issues and provide a more detailed explanation:

1. **Reversing Lists**:
   - The original program reverses the lists `lista_A` and `lista_B`. This is unnecessary because the problem does not specify any specific order for processing elements. Reversing the lists complicates the logic without providing any benefit.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The original program incorrectly accumulates the costs. Specifically, the logic for updating `pref` and `soma_b` is flawed. It does not properly account for the cumulative cost of swaps and the cost of moving Kirill to the desired position.

3. **Result Calculation**:
   - The original program's result calculation part is missing the cumulative cost of swaps correctly. It does not properly handle the cumulative cost of swaps and the cost of moving Kirill to the desired position.

### Correct Solution

To correctly solve the problem, we need to maintain a cumulative cost of swaps and ensure we update the minimum cost appropriately. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    lista_A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_B = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Initialize the cost array
    cost = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        cost[i] = cost[i + 1] + lista_B[i]

    # Initialize the minimum cost
    min_cost = float('inf')

    # Calculate the minimum cost
    for i in range(n - k + 1, n + 1):
        current_cost = cost[i] + min(cost[j] + lista_A[j] for j in range(i - k, i))
        min_cost = min(min_cost, current_cost)

    print(min_cost)

def func_2():
    numero_testes = int(input())
    for _ in range(numero_testes):
        func_1()

# Call the main function
func_2()
```

### Explanation

1. **Cost Array Initialization**:
   - We initialize a cost array `cost` where `cost[i]` represents the cumulative cost of moving Kirill from position `i` to the end of the queue. This is calculated by iterating from the end of the queue to the beginning and adding the values of `lista_B`.

2. **Minimum Cost Calculation**:
   - We iterate from `n - k + 1` to `n` to find the minimum cost of moving Kirill to the desired position. For each position `i`, we calculate the cost of moving Kirill from position `i` to the end of the queue and add the minimum cost of moving Kirill from positions `i - k` to `i - 1` to the current position `i`.

3. **Result**:
   - We keep track of the minimum cost encountered during the iteration and print it at the end.

### Conclusion

The original program has logical errors and does not correctly calculate the minimum cost. The corrected solution maintains a cumulative cost of swaps and ensures the minimum cost is calculated correctly.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: **False**

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
