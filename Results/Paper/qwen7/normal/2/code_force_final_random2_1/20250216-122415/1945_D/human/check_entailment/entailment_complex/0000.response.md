Reasoning:

- **Function 1 Analysis**:
  - The function correctly initializes `n` and `k` from the input.
  - It reverses both `lista_A` and `lista_B`, which is unnecessary because the problem doesn't specify the order of operations. However, reversing the lists does not affect the logic since the loop iterates from `n-k` to `0`.
  - The function calculates the minimum cost by comparing elements from `lista_A` and `lista_B`. It maintains a running sum `soma_b` and a prefix sum `pref` to calculate the cost of moving Kirill to different positions.
  - The logic inside the loop correctly updates `pref` and `soma_b` based on the conditions provided in the problem statement.
  - The final result is calculated correctly by iterating through the last `k` elements and finding the minimum cost.

- **Function 2 Analysis**:
  - The function correctly processes multiple test cases.
  - It calls `func_1()` for each test case, ensuring that the logic for calculating the minimum cost is applied to each set of inputs.
  - The function does not return any value, but it prints the results for each test case, which is consistent with the problem requirements.

Given that both functions correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement and handle the inputs as specified, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
