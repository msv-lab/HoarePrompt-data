Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head defines the variables `j` and `lex` as well as the list `arr`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range of 2, meaning `j` can take values 0 or 1.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is either 0 or 1.
   - `lex` is between 1 and 52 (inclusive).
   - `arr` is a list containing the elements 1, 26, and 26.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `j` can be either 0 or 1, the loop will continue if `j` is 0 and it needs to become 1 for the next iteration.
   - `lex` does not change within the loop, so its value remains the same.
   - `arr` does not change within the loop, so its value remains the same.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `j` needs to be 1 for the next iteration.
   - `lex` and `arr` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`j` is 1, `lex` is between 1 and 52 (inclusive), `arr` is a list containing the elements 1, 26, and 26**.
