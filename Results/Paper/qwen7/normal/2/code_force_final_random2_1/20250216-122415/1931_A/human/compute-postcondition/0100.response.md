Output State: **j is 1, lex is between -25 and 26 (inclusive), and arr is a list containing the elements 1, 26, 26, and 26.**

Explanation: The loop runs twice based on the value of `j` (which can be either 0 or 1). Given the conditions inside the loop, `lex` will be reduced by 1 or 26 each time, and `arr` will append 1 or 26 accordingly. After the loop runs 3 times, `lex` will be within the range of -25 to 26 (inclusive) because it starts from a value between 27 and 78 and is reduced by a total of 78 units (3 times 26) over three iterations. Since the loop runs exactly 3 times, `arr` will contain the elements 1, 26, 26, and 26.
