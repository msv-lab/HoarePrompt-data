Output State: **`i` is 7, `cases` must be greater than 0, `temp` is equal to `chr(info[6][3] + 96) + chr(info[7][3] + 96)`, `j` is 3**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `temp` by concatenating `temp` with `chr(info[i][j] + 96)`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is 7 and `j` is 3. So, `temp` is updated to `chr(info[6][3] + 96) + chr(info[7][3] + 96)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
