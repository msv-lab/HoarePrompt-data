Output State: **`j` is 0; `lex` is either -26 or within the range [-52, -27]; `arr` is a list containing the elements 26, 26, 26.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decreased by 26. Given that `lex` was initially either 0 or within the range [-26, 52], subtracting 26 from these values results in `lex` being either -26 (if it was 0) or within the range [-52, -27] (if it was within the original range). The values of `j` and `arr` remain unchanged.
