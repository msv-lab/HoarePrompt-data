### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `cases`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `lex` which represents the encoded value.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `arr` for each test case.
   - It then attempts to fill `arr` with values based on the conditions:
     - If `lex < 28`, it appends `1` and subtracts `1` from `lex`.
     - If `28 <= lex < 52`, it appends `26` and subtracts `26` from `lex`.
     - If `52 <= lex <= 78`, it appends `26` and subtracts `26` from `lex`.
   - After filling `arr`, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr` and sorts `arr`.

3. **Generating the Word:**
   - For each processed list `arr`, the program constructs a string `temp` by converting the first three elements of `arr` to their corresponding characters using `chr(info[i][j] + 96)` and prints it.

#### Key Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Value:**
   - The program always appends the remaining value to the end of `arr` without considering the lexicographical order.
   - For example, for `n = 24`, the correct word is `aav` (1 + 1 + 22), but the program incorrectly generates `aaa` (1 + 1 + 21).

2. **Sorting Logic:**
   - The sorting logic is applied to the entire list `arr`, which may not necessarily produce the lexicographically smallest word. For instance, sorting `[1, 26, 1]` results in `[1, 1, 26]`, which is not the lexicographically smallest word for the input `24`.

3. **Lack of Proper Distribution:**
   - The program does not ensure that the smallest possible values are distributed among the first two characters before assigning the remaining value to the third character.

#### Correct Approach:

To fix the issues, the program should:
- Ensure the first two characters are assigned the smallest possible values.
- Distribute the remaining value to the third character.
- Construct the word based on these assignments.

#### Example Fix:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    info = []
    for i in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        arr = [1, 1, lex - 2]
        arr.sort()
        info.append(arr)
    for i in range(cases):
        temp = ''
        for j in range(3):
            temp += chr(info[i][j] + 96)
        print(temp)
```

This approach ensures that the first two characters are assigned the smallest possible values (1 and 1) and the remaining value is distributed to the third character, ensuring the lexicographically smallest word is generated.

### Final Evaluation:

Given the analysis, the original assessment was accurate. The provided program does not correctly handle all cases and fails to generate the lexicographically smallest word for certain inputs.

**Final: False**
