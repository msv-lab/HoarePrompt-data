Output State: `i` is 3, `cases` must be greater than 0, `j` is 2, `temp` is a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[3][2] + 96` for each iteration of the loop.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be 3 (since the loop runs for 3 iterations and `i` starts from 0), `cases` will still need to be greater than 0, `j` will be 2 (the last value it takes in the loop), and `temp` will be a string consisting of the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[3][2] + 96` for each of the three iterations.
