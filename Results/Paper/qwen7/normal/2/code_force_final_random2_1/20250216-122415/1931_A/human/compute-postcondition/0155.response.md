Output State: `arr` is a list of length `cases` filled with lists of integers, where each inner list contains 5 elements. The first two elements of each inner list are always 0s or 1s, the next two elements are always 26s, and the last element is the remaining value of `lex` after all operations. `info` is a list containing the sorted `arr` from all iterations. `j` is 2 after the loop completes, and `i` is equal to `cases` (the total number of test cases).

In more detail, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- `arr` will contain a list for each test case, with the structure `[0/1, 0/1, 26, 26, remaining_lex_value]`.
- `info` will be a list of all these `arr` lists combined and then sorted.
- `j` will be 2 since it increments by 1 in each iteration of the inner loop and the inner loop runs twice.
- `i` will be equal to `cases` because the outer loop runs `cases` times.
