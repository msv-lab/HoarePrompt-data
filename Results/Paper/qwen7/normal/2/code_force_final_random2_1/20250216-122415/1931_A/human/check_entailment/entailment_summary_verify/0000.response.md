### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the requirements and the given function summary.

#### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `lex` which represents the encoded value.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program attempts to break down `lex` into three parts by assigning values to the first two characters and then determining the third character.
   - It uses a series of `if` statements to determine the values for the first two characters:
     - If `lex < 28`, it assigns `1` to both the first and second characters and subtracts `1` from `lex`.
     - If `28 <= lex < 52`, it assigns `26` to the second character and subtracts `26` from `lex`.
     - If `52 <= lex <= 78`, it again assigns `26` to the second character and subtracts `26` from `lex`.
   - After processing the first two characters, it directly appends the remaining value to the list and sorts the list.
   - It then constructs a string from the sorted list and prints it.

#### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Value:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the distribution of the remaining value after assigning the minimum possible values to the first two characters.
   - For example, for `n = 24`, the program assigns `1` to both the first and second characters, resulting in `1 + 1 + 22 = 24`, which should give `aav`. However, the program incorrectly generates `aaa` because it does not properly distribute the remaining value.

2. **Sorting and Construction:**
   - The program sorts the list before constructing the string, which is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results if the order of assignment is not handled correctly.

#### Correct Approach:
- To find the lexicographically smallest word, we need to assign the smallest possible values to the first two characters and then determine the third character.
- We should ensure that the smallest possible values are assigned to the first two characters and then correctly distribute the remaining value to the third character.

#### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        # Assign the smallest possible values to the first two characters
        char1 = 1
        char2 = 1
        if lex >= 28:
            char1 = 1
            char2 = 26
            lex -= 27
        else:
            char1 = 1
            char2 = lex - 1
            lex = 1
        
        # Determine the third character
        char3 = lex
        
        # Construct the lexicographically smallest word
        word = chr(char1 + 96) + chr(char2 + 96) + chr(char3 + 96)
        print(word)
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was accurate. The provided program does not correctly handle all cases and fails to generate the lexicographically smallest word for certain inputs. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

**Final: False**
