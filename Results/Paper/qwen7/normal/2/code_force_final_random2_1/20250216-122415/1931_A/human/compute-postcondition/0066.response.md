Output State: **`j` is 0 or 1, the value of `lex` is greater than or equal to 28 and less than or equal to 78, and lex is greater than or equal to 52; `arr` is a list containing the element 26.**

The code `arr.append(26)` adds the element `26` to the list `arr`. Since `j` and `lex` are not affected by this operation, their states remain unchanged.
