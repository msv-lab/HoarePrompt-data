Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(3)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j`.

2. **Determine the current state of `j`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than 3.

4. **Update the state of `j`**: Since the loop increments `j` by 1 each time it iterates, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 1.

5. **Check if the loop should continue**: With `j` now being 1, the loop will continue as long as `j < 3`, which is true.

6. **Adjust the other variables**: The other variables (`i`, `cases`, and `temp`) are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop.

Based on these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 1, `cases` must be greater than 0, `j` is 1, `temp` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `info[0][0] + 96`**
