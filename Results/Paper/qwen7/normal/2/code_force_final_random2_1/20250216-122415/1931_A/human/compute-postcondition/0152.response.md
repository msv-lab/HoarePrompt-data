Output State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is an integer, `arr` is either [1, 1, 0, 0, lex] or [1, 0, 0, 0, lex] depending on the value of `lex`, `info` is a list containing the list [1, 26, 26, 26, 26], and `i` is 1 or 2.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(lex)` appends the value of `lex` to the list `arr`. Since `arr` was either `[1, 1, 0, 0]` or `[1, 0, 0, 0]` depending on the value of `lex`, after appending `lex`, `arr` becomes either `[1, 1, 0, 0, lex]` or `[1, 0, 0, 0, lex]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
