Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(3)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j`.

2. **Determine the current state of `j`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` must be 2.

3. **Understand the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be less than 3 (since `range(3)` generates values from 0 to 2).

4. **Adjust the state**: Since `j` is currently 2, it will increment to 3 in the next iteration, and the loop will terminate because 3 is not less than 3. Therefore, we need to ensure that `j` is set to 3 for the next iteration.

5. **Check other variables**: The other variables (`i`, `cases`, and `temp`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted based on the loop condition.

Based on the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 5, `cases` must be greater than 0, `temp` is 'aa', `j` is 3**
