Output State: `i` is 9, `cases` must be greater than 0, `temp` is a string consisting of the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[8][4] + 96`, `info[9][4] + 96`, and `info[9][5] + 96`, `j` is 5.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be 9 because the loop increments `i` by 1 at the start of each iteration and runs for a total of 3 iterations, starting from 0. The variable `cases` must still be greater than 0 as it was not modified within the loop. The variable `temp` will be a string formed by concatenating the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[8][4] + 96`, `info[9][4] + 96`, and `info[9][5] + 96` because the loop runs for 3 iterations, and `j` will be 5 after the last iteration, having incremented from 0 to 4.
