Output State: `i` is 7, `cases` must be greater than 0, `temp` is equal to 'chr(info[6][3] + 96) + chr(info[7][3] + 96) + chr(info[7][4] + 96)', `j` is 4.

In natural language: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` remains unchanged at 7, `cases` still needs to be greater than 0, and `temp` contains the concatenated string formed from the characters derived from `info` based on the indices provided in the loop. The final value of `temp` is 'chr(info[6][3] + 96) + chr(info[7][3] + 96) + chr(info[7][4] + 96)', and `j` is incremented to 4, indicating the loop has completed its iterations.
