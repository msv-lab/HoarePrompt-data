Output State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is an integer, `arr` is either [0, 0, 1, 1, lex] or [0, 0, 0, 1, lex] depending on the value of `lex`, `info` is a list containing the list [1, 26, 26, 26, 26], and `i` is 1 or 2.**

Explanation: The `sort()` method sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. Initially, `arr` can be either `[1, 1, 0, 0, lex]` or `[1, 0, 0, 0, lex]`. After sorting, both cases become `[0, 0, 1, 1, lex]` or `[0, 0, 0, 1, lex]`, respectively. The values of `j`, `lex`, `info`, and `i` remain unchanged.
