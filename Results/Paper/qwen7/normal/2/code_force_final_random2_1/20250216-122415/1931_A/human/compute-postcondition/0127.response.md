Output State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is an input integer - 1, `arr` is either [1, 1] or [26, 1] depending on whether `lex` is less than 27, `info` is a list containing the list [1, 26, 26, 26, 26], and `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `lex` was an input integer, so now it is `lex - 1`. The conditions for `arr` depend on the value of `lex`, which has changed, thus `arr` will now be [1, 1] if `lex - 1` is less than 28, or [26, 1] otherwise. All other variables remain unchanged.
