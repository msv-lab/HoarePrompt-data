Output State: **`j` is 1; `lex` is between -25 and 26 (inclusive); `arr` is a list containing the elements 1, 26, 26, and 26.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decremented by 26. Since `lex` was originally between 1 and 52 (inclusive), subtracting 26 from it results in a new range of `-25` to `26` (inclusive). The values of `j` and `arr` remain unchanged.
