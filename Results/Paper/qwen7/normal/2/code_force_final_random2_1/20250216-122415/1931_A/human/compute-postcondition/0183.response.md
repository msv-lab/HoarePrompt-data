Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `j` and `cases`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `j` is less than 3.
   - The loop also requires that `cases` must be greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 7 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted).
   - `cases` must be greater than 0 (this condition needs to be maintained).
   - `temp` is equal to `chr(info[6][j] + 96)` (this value is computed within the loop and does not affect the loop continuation condition).
   - `j` must be less than 3 (at the end of the previous iteration, `j` was 2 because the loop ran from 0 to 2).

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` must be less than 3, for the loop to continue, `j` should be incremented by 1 from its current value of 2 to 3.
   - `cases` must still be greater than 0 to allow the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 7, `cases` must be greater than 0, `temp` is equal to `chr(info[6][j] + 96)`, `j` must be less than 3 (now `j` is 3)**
