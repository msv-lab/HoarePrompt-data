Output State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is an integer - 26, `arr` is either [1, 1, 0] or [1, 0, 0] depending on the value of `lex`, `info` is a list containing the list [1, 26, 26, 26, 26], and `i` is 1 or 2.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decreased by 26. Since `lex` was initially an integer, now it is `lex - 26`. The value of `arr` depends on the value of `lex`. If `lex` was 26, then `arr` was [1, 1, 26]; now it becomes [1, 1, 0]. If `lex` was 52 (26 * 2), then `arr` was [1, 26, 26]; now it becomes [1, 0, 0]. The values of `j`, `info`, and `i` remain unchanged.
