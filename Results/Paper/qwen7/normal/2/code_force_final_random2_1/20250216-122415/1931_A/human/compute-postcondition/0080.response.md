Output State: **`j` is either 0 or 1; `lex` is between 1 and 52 (inclusive); `arr` is a list containing the elements 1, 26, and 26.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decreased by 26. Since `lex` was originally between 27 and 78 (inclusive), subtracting 26 from it results in a new value for `lex` that is between 1 and 52 (inclusive). The values of `j` and `arr` remain unchanged.
