Postcondition: `j` is 2, `lex` is an integer, `arr` is either [1, 1] or [1, 26] depending on the value of `lex`, `info` is a list containing the list [1, 26, 26, 26, 26], and `i` is 1 or 2. If `lex` is less than 28, `lex` is adjusted to either `lex` - 1 or `lex` - 26, and `arr` is updated accordingly. If `lex` is 27 or more, `lex` is adjusted to either `lex` - 26 or `lex` - 52, and `arr` remains [1, 26].
