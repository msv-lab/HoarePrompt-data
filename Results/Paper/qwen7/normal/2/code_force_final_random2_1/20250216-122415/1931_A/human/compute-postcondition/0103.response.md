Output State: **j is 1, lex is between -25 and 26 (inclusive), and arr is a list containing the elements 1, 26, 26, 26, 26; info is a list containing the list [1, 26, 26, 26, 26]**.

The code appends the list `arr` to the list `info`. Since `arr` contains the elements [1, 26, 26, 26, 26], after appending, `info` becomes a list containing this single list. All other variables (`j` and `lex`) remain unchanged.
