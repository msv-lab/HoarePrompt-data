Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `cases`. These are the only variables that can be adjusted.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 0 because the `range(cases)` function generates numbers from 0 to `cases-1`.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `cases`. Therefore, `i` should start at 0 and `cases` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Adjust the States**: Based on the above points, we need to adjust the initial state of `i` to 0 and ensure that `cases` is greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers where the last element is `lex` and the rest of the elements are either 0 or 1, with the total count of 1s being equal to the number of cases.
- `j` is 1 for all sublists in `arr`.
- `info` is a list containing the results of all iterations, with each sublist sorted and having the same structure as described above. The length of `info` is equal to the value of `cases`.

The only variables that need adjustment are `i` and `cases`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 0, `cases` must be greater than 0**
