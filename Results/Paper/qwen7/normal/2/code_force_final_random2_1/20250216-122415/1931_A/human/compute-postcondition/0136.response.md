Postcondition: `j` is 2, `lex` is an integer, `arr` is either [1, 1], [26, 1], or [1, 26] depending on the value of `lex`, `info` is a list containing the list [1, 26, 26, 26, 26], and `i` is 2 if `lex` is less than 27 or 1 otherwise. If `lex` is less than 28, `lex` is adjusted to either `lex` - 1, `lex` - 26, or `lex` - 52 accordingly.
