Output State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is an integer, `arr` is either [1, 1, 26] or [1, 26, 26] depending on the value of `lex`, `info` is a list containing the list [1, 26, 26, 26, 26], and `i` is 1 or 2.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(26)` adds the value `26` to the end of the list `arr`. Since `arr` was either `[1, 1]` or `[1, 26]` depending on the value of `lex`, after appending `26`, `arr` becomes either `[1, 1, 26]` or `[1, 26, 26]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
