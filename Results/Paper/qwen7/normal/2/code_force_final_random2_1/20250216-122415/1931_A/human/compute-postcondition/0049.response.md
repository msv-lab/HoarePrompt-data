Output State: **The loop will execute twice since the range is specified as 2. After the loop completes, `j` will be 1, `lex` will be either 0 or within the range [-26, 52], and `arr` will be a list containing the elements 26, 26.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations (which is twice in this case), the variable `j` will have incremented to 1. The value of `lex` will be adjusted based on the conditions inside the loop, ending up being either 0 or within the range from -26 to 52. The list `arr` will contain two elements, both of which are 26, as per the conditions specified in the loop body.
