Output State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is an integer, `arr` is either [1, 1, 0, 0] or [1, 0, 0, 0] depending on the value of `lex`, `info` is a list containing the list [1, 26, 26, 26, 26], and `i` is 1 or 2.**

In this final state after all iterations of the loop, `j` will still be 2 since the loop runs a fixed number of times (2 times) regardless of the value of `lex`. The variable `lex` will be reduced according to the conditions within the loop until it is no longer less than 52. The list `arr` will contain up to four elements, each being either 1 or 26, depending on how many times the corresponding conditions were met during the loop's execution. The list `info` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. The variable `i` will be either 1 or 2, indicating the maximum number of times the loop could have executed based on the initial value of `lex`.
