Output State: `i` is 7, `cases` must be greater than 0, `temp` is equal to 'chr(info[6][3] + 96) + chr(info[7][3] + 96) + chr(info[7][4] + 96)', `j` is 4.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` remains 7 because the loop does not change the value of `i`. The variable `cases` must still be greater than 0 as it was not modified within the loop. The variable `temp` contains the concatenated result of converting characters from the `info` list based on the specified indices and additions, and `j` is now 4 because the loop ran for 3 iterations, incrementing `j` from 0 to 3.
