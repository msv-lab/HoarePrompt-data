Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `j` is 1, `lex` is an input integer, `arr` is an empty list, `info` is a list containing the list [1, 26, 26, 26, 26], `i` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex < 28:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    elif lex <= 78:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `j` is 1, `lex` is an input integer, `arr` is either [1] or [26] depending on whether `lex` is less than 28, `info` is a list containing the list [1, 26, 26, 26, 26], and `i` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 2, `lex` is an integer, `arr` is either [1, 1] or [1, 26] depending on the value of `lex`, `info` is a list containing the list [1, 26, 26, 26, 26], and `i` is 1 or 2. If `lex` is less than 28, `lex` is adjusted to either `lex` - 1 or `lex` - 26, and `arr` is updated accordingly. If `lex` is 27 or more, `lex` is adjusted to either `lex` - 26 or `lex` - 52, and `arr` remains [1, 26].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 2, `lex` is an integer, `arr` is either [1, 1, 0] or [1, 0, 0] depending on the value of `lex`, `info` is a list containing the list [1, 26, 26, 26, 26], and `i` is 1 or 2. If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` is updated to either [1, 1, 1] or [1, 25, 1] depending on the value of `lex`. If `lex` is less than 52, `arr` is updated to either [1, 1, 0] or [1, 0, 0] based on the value of `lex`. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
