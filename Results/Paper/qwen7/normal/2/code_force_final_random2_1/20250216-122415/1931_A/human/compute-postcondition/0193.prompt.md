You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78.
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    info = []
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        
        lex = int(input())
        
        for j in range(2):
            if lex < 28:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            elif lex <= 78:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        
        arr.append(lex)
        
        arr.sort()
        
        info.append(arr)
        
    #State: Output State: `arr` is a sorted list of integers where the last element is `lex` and the rest of the elements are either 0 or 1, with the total count of 1s being equal to the number of cases. `j` is 1 for all sublists in `arr`. `info` is a list containing the results of all iterations, with each sublist sorted and having the same structure as described above. The length of `info` is equal to the value of `cases`.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop, `arr` will contain a series of lists, each sorted, with the last element being the final value of `lex` for that iteration, and the preceding elements being either 0s or 1s based on the logic inside the loop. The `info` list will hold all these results, maintaining the order of the iterations.
    for i in range(cases):
        temp = ''
        
        for j in range(3):
            temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)
        
        print(temp)
        
    #State: `i` is 9, `cases` must be greater than 0, `temp` is a string consisting of the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[8][4] + 96`, `j` is 5.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns a value based on predefined constraints where t is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and for each test case, n is an integer between 3 and 78.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
