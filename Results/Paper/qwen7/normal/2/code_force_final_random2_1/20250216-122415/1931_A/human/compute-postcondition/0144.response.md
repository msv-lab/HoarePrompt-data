Output State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is an integer - 26, `arr` is either [1, 1, 0] or [1, 0, 0] depending on the value of `lex`, `info` is a list containing the list [1, 26, 26, 26, 26], and `i` is 1 or 2.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decremented by 26. Since `lex` was an integer, now it is `lex - 26`. The value of `arr` changes based on the value of `lex`. If `lex` was 26, `arr` becomes [1, 1, 0]; if `lex` was 52, `arr` becomes [1, 0, 0]. All other variables remain unchanged.
