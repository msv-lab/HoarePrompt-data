Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `j` which ranges from `0` to `1`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range `0` to `1`. Since `j` is either `0` or `1` at the end of the previous iteration, it means the loop can still execute if `j` remains within this range.

3. **Adjust the State**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must remain within the range `0` to `1`. The other variables (`lex` and `arr`) do not change based on the loop condition and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `j` must be either `0` or `1`.
- `lex` must be between `27` and `78` (inclusive).
- `arr` must be a list containing either the element `1` or the element `26`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`j` is either 0 or 1, `lex` is between 27 and 78 (inclusive), and `arr` is a list containing either the element 1 or the element 26**.
