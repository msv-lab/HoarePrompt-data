Postcondition: `j` is 0, `lex` is either -26 or within the range [-52, -27], and `arr` is a list containing the elements 26, 26, 26. If `lex` is less than 52, `lex` remains unchanged and `arr` becomes a list containing the elements 26, 26, 26. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `lex` remains unchanged and `arr` becomes a list containing the elements 26, 26, 26.
