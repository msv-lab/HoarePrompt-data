Output State: **`j` is 0 or 1; `lex` is less than 27; `arr` contains the element 1**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decremented by 1, so `lex` is now `lex - 1`. Since `lex` was originally less than 28, after decrementing by 1, `lex` is now less than 27. The values of `j` and `arr` remain unchanged.
