Output State: **`j` is 1; `lex` is either 0 or within the range [-25, 52]; `arr` is a list containing the elements 26, 26**

Explanation: The variable `lex` is decremented by 26. Given the initial conditions, if `lex` was less than 27, it would now be `lex - 26`, which could be 0 (if `lex` was 26) or a negative number between -25 and -1 (if `lex` was between 27 and 52). If `lex` was within the range [26, 78], subtracting 26 would result in a value within the range [0, 52]. The values of `j` and `arr` remain unchanged.
