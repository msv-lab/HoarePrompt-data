Postcondition: `j` is 1, `lex` is between -25 and 51 (inclusive), and `arr` is a list containing the elements 1, 26, 26, and 26. If `lex` is less than 28, `lex` remains unchanged and `arr` is updated to contain four elements 1, 26, 26, and 26. Otherwise, `lex` remains between -25 and 26 (inclusive).
