Output State: **`sumo` is increased by int(a[1]) + int(a[2]), `i` is 2, `bets` is a positive integer, `a[1]` is equal to `prod // a[1]`**

Explanation: The code `sumo += int(a[i])` adds the value of `int(a[i])` to `sumo`. Given that `i` is 2, it means `sumo` is now increased by `int(a[2])`. The value of `a[1]` remains unchanged and is still equal to `prod // a[1]`. The other variables (`i` and `bets`) remain unaffected by this operation.
