You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

    3
    
    6 3 2
    
    5
    
    9 4 6 8 3

Output

    27 41 12 
    1 1 
    -1
    1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, then `sumo` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ans` will contain the string representations of all elements in `a` separated by spaces, and `ans` will be printed. The variable `prod` will hold the product of the first `bets` elements in the list `a`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to the number of bets (`bets`), `sumo` will be the sum of the modified elements in the list `a` (each element divided by the product of all elements in the list), and `ans` will contain the final modified elements of `a` as a space-separated string. If the sum of these modified elements is greater than or equal to the initial product, `sumo` will retain its value; otherwise, `ans` will be printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
- There are \( n \) outcomes.
- For each outcome \( i \), there is a multiplier \( k_i \).
- We need to distribute coins such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome.

### Given Program Analysis
1. **Reading Input:**
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `bets` is the number of outcomes.
   - `a` is a list of multipliers for each outcome.

2. **Calculating Total Multiplier Product:**
   - `prod = 1`
   - `for i in range(bets):`
     - `prod *= a[i]`
   This calculates the product of all multipliers.

3. **Calculating Individual Bets:**
   - `for i in range(bets):`
     - `a[i] = prod // a[i]`
     - `sumo += int(a[i])`
   This calculates the individual bets as the product divided by the multiplier for each outcome and sums these bets.

4. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - If `sumo >= prod`, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it constructs and prints the list of bets.

### Correctness Analysis
1. **Feasibility Check:**
   - The program correctly checks if the sum of the bets is greater than or equal to the product of the multipliers.
   - If `sumo >= prod`, it correctly prints `-1`.

2. **Betting Calculation:**
   - The betting strategy used (`a[i] = prod // a[i]`) ensures that the total bet is minimized while still being less than the product of the multipliers.
   - However, this approach might not always result in a feasible solution where the total bet is strictly less than the product of the multipliers.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Consider a scenario where all multipliers are the same, e.g., \( k_1 = k_2 = \ldots = k_n = k \). In this case, `prod = k^n` and `a[i] = k^(n-1)` for all \( i \). The sum of these bets would be \( n \cdot k^{n-1} \), which is not necessarily less than \( k^n \).

### Example Counterexample
Consider the following input:
```
1
3
3 3 3
```
- `prod = 3 * 3 * 3 = 27`
- `a[0] = 27 // 3 = 9`, `a[1] = 27 // 3 = 9`, `a[2] = 27 // 3 = 9`
- `sumo = 9 + 9 + 9 = 27`
- Since `sumo == prod`, the program prints `-1`, but a feasible solution exists (e.g., 1, 1, 26).

### Conclusion
The given program does not always produce a correct solution. It fails to handle cases where a feasible distribution of bets exists but the calculated bets do not meet the strict inequality condition.
