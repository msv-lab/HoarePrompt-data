Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` and `bets`.
2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i < bets`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `i` is 2
   - `bets` is a positive integer greater than 1
   - `ans` is 'a[0]' + str(a[1]) + ' '

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented to 3.
   - `bets` remains the same as it is a loop control variable and does not change within the loop body unless explicitly modified.
   - The value of `ans` is not directly affected by the loop head, so it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `bets` is a positive integer greater than 1, `ans` is 'a[0]' + str(a[1]) + ' '`**
