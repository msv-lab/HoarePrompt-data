Output State: **`i` is equal to `bets`, `sumo` is increased by the integer value of `a[0]` + the integer value of `a[1]` + ... + the integer value of `a[bets-1]`, `bets` is greater than 0, `a[i]` is assigned the value of `prod // a[i]` for each `i` in the range of `bets`, and `ans` is the string containing the values of `a[i]` concatenated with a space.**

Explanation: The code appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to the variable `ans`. Since `i` is equal to `bets`, the loop will not execute because the range of `i` is from `0` to `bets-1`. Therefore, `ans` remains an empty string. All other variables remain unchanged.
