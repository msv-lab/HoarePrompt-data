Output State: **`T` is equal to `T + 1`, `t` is the same as before, `i` is equal to `bets`, `bets` must be a positive integer, `sumo` is increased by the sum of `int(a[i])` for all `i` from `0` to `bets-1`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `prod` is multiplied by `a[i]`, `ans` is the concatenation of 'a[0]', 'a[1]', and 'a[3]' with spaces in between if `sumo` is less than `prod`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.**

This means that the value of `prod` is updated by multiplying its current value with `a[i]`. The other variables remain in their previous states as described.
