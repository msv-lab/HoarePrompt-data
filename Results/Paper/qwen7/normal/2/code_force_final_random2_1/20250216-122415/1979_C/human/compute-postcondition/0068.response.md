Output State: **`i` is 0; `bets` is a positive integer; `ans` is 'a[0] '**

Explanation: The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string representation of `a[i]` (where `i` is 0) to the variable `ans`. Since `i` is 0, `a[i]` is `a[0]`. The value of `bets` remains unchanged, and `i` remains 0 as no operation changes its value.
