Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(bets):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `bets`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is not explicitly initialized in the loop head, but it will start from 0 in the first iteration.
   - `bets` is given as an input integer.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < bets`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` will start from 0 in the first iteration, we can assume `i` is 0 initially.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `bets` must be greater than 0.

5. **Consider the other given variables**:
   - `t` is 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers from the input split and converted to integers.
   - `prod` is 1.
   - These variables are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution directly based on the given information.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `i` being 0 and `bets` being greater than 0.

**State: **`t` is 0, `bets` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
