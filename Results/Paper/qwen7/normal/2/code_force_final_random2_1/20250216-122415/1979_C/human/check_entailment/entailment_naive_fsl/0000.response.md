Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly distribute the coins according to the problem description. Specifically, the program calculates the product of all multipliers (`prod`) and then divides this product by each multiplier to determine the bet amounts. However, this approach does not guarantee that the total bet amount will be strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
3 2 7
```

The program calculates `prod` as \(3 \times 2 \times 7 = 42\). Then it sets the bets as follows:
- Bet on the first outcome: \(42 / 3 = 14\)
- Bet on the second outcome: \(42 / 2 = 21\)
- Bet on the third outcome: \(42 / 7 = 6\)

The total bet amount is \(14 + 21 + 6 = 41\), which is less than the amount received back for the first and second outcomes (42 and 42 respectively). However, for the third outcome, the total bet amount (41) is not strictly less than the amount received back (42).

A correct approach would involve finding a way to distribute the coins such that the total bet amount is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. The current implementation does not ensure this condition is met in all cases.
