Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires distributing coins across different outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes and the multipliers \(k_i\).
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers, which represents the minimum total amount of coins that would need to be returned if any one of the outcomes wins.
   - It then divides this product by each multiplier to get the amount to bet on each outcome, ensuring that the total bet is less than the return for any winning outcome.
   - Finally, it checks if the sum of these bets is less than the product. If so, it prints the bets; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program handles the constraints correctly, including the upper limit of 10^9 for the bets and the product calculation.
   - The logic ensures that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the product, meeting the problem's requirements.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The program logic is sound and aligns with the problem statement.
   - It correctly identifies when a solution is impossible (when the sum of the bets is not less than the product).
   - The solution provided in the example matches the expected behavior of the program.

Given the above analysis, the program is correctly implemented to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
