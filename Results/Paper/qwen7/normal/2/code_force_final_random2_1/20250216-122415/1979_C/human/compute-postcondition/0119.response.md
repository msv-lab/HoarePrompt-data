Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`. For each test case, it calculates the product of the first `n` integers, modifies each integer in the list by dividing the product by the respective integer, and computes the sum of these modified integers. If the sum is greater than or equal to the initial product, it prints `-1`; otherwise, it prints the modified integers as a space-separated string.**
