Output State: **`i` is 2; `sumo` is increased by the integer value of `a[0]` + the integer value of `a[1]` + the integer value of `a[2]`; `bets` must be greater than 1; `a[i]` is assigned the value of `prod // a[i]`**

Explanation: The code `sumo += int(a[i])` increments `sumo` by the integer value of `a[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 2, `a[i]` refers to `a[2]`. Therefore, `sumo` is updated by adding the integer value of `a[2]` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
