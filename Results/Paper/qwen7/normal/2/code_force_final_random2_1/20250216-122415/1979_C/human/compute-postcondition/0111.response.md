Output State: `i` is `bets`, `ans` is a space-separated string containing all elements of `a` from `a[0]` to `a[bets-1]`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations (from `i=0` to `i=bets-1`), the variable `i` will be equal to `bets`. The variable `ans` will contain a string with all elements of the list `a` from index `0` to `index bets-1`, each element converted to a string and separated by spaces.
