Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `bets`, `bets` is a positive integer greater than 2, `sumo` is increased by the sum of `int(a[i])` for all `i` from `0` to `bets-1` if `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, otherwise `ans` is the concatenation of 'a[0]', 'a[1]', and 'a[3]' with spaces in between.**
