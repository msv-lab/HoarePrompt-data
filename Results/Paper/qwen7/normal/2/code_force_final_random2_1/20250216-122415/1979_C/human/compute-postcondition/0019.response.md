Output State: **`i` is 1, `sumo` is increased by the integer value of `a[0]` + the integer value of `a[1]`, `bets` must be greater than 1, `a[i]` is assigned the value of `prod // a[i]`**.

Explanation: The code `sumo += int(a[i])` increments `sumo` by the integer value of `a[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `a[i]` refers to `a[1]`. So, `sumo` is increased by the integer value of `a[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
