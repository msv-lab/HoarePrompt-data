Output State: **`i` is 0, `sumo` is increased by the integer value of `a[0]` + the integer value of `a[1]` + ... + the integer value of `a[bets-1]`, `bets` is greater than 0, `a[i]` is assigned the value of `prod // a[i]` for each `i` in the range of `bets`, and `ans` is the string containing the values of `a[i]` concatenated with a space, and `ans` has an additional space added to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space to the string `ans`. Since `i` is initially 0, the first element of the list `a` is appended to `ans`. Therefore, `ans` now contains the first element of `a` followed by a space. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
