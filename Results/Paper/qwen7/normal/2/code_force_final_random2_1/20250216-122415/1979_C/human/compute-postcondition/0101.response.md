Based on the initial state provided:

- `a[i]` is updated to `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `bets-1`.
- `i` is equal to `bets`.
- `sumo` is the sum of `int(a[j])` for all `j` where `0 <= j < bets`, and `sumo` is increased by `int(a[bets-1])`.
- The current value of `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`.

Given this information, the print statement `print(-1)` will simply print the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
