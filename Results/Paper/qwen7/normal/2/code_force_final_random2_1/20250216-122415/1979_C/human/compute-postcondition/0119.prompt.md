You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each test case contains a positive integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a list of n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Additionally, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        bets = int(input())
        
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        prod = 1
        
        for i in range(bets):
            prod *= a[i]
        
        sumo = 0
        
        for i in range(bets):
            a[i] = prod // a[i]
            sumo += int(a[i])
        
        if sumo >= prod:
            print(-1)
        else:
            ans = ''
            for i in range(bets):
                ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
            print(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `bets`, `sumo` will be the sum of `int(a[j])` for all `j` where `0 <= j < bets`, `bets` will be the number of bets entered, and `a[i]` will be updated to `prod // a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `bets-1`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, then `sumo` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `ans` will contain the string representations of all elements in `a` separated by spaces, and `ans` will be printed. The variable `prod` will hold the product of the first `bets` elements in the list `a`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to the number of bets (`bets`), `sumo` will be the sum of the modified elements in the list `a` (each element divided by the product of all elements in the list), and `ans` will contain the final modified elements of `a` as a space-separated string. If the sum of these modified elements is greater than or equal to the initial product, `sumo` will retain its value; otherwise, `ans` will be printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`. The function returns different outputs based on the conditions specified for `t`, `n`, and the list `k_i`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
