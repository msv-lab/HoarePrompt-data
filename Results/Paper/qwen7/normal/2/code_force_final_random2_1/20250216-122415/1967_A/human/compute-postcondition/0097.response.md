Output State: **`ii` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `r` is `a[n-1]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The values of `ii`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `r`, `rem`, and `y` remain unchanged. The list `a` is updated to be sorted.
