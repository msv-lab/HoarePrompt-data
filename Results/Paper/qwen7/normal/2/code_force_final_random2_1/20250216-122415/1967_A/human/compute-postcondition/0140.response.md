Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `ii` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `r` is the last value of `a` in the list. Since `a` is not explicitly defined, we cannot determine `r` directly from the given information.
   - `rem` is 0.
   - `y` is `n - 1 - i` where `i` is `n - 1`. Given `i = n - 1`, we substitute to get `y = n - 1 - (n - 1) = 0`.
   - The condition `k != 0` is false, which means `k` is indeed 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)
   ```

3. **Substitute Values:**
   - `r` is the last value of `a` in the list, but since `a` is not defined, we cannot determine its exact value.
   - `n` is greater than 1, so let's denote it as `n > 1`.
   - `rem` is 0.
   - `y` is 0.

4. **Expression Simplification:**
   The expression inside the `print` function simplifies to:
   \[
   (r - 1) \times n + 1 + 0 + 0 = (r - 1) \times n + 1
   \]

Given the above, the exact value of `r` is unknown, but we know the rest of the expression. Therefore, the output will be in terms of `r` and `n`.

**Final Output:**
Output: **(r - 1) * n + 1 (where r is the last value of a in the list and n is greater than 1)**
