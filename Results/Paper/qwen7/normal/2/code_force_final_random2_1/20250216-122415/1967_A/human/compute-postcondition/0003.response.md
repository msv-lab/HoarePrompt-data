Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained by mapping each element from the input split by spaces to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and the list `a` (which is initially a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer) are updated to reflect the sorted list. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged.
