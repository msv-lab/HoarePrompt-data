Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained by mapping each element from the input split by spaces to an integer, `r` is the first element of the list `a`, `rem` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `rem` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, or `r`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
