Output State: **`ii` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is `k - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])`, `r` is `a[0] + a[1]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 3, `r` is `a[i + 1]`**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `r` to be equal to `a[i + 1]`. Given that `i` is 2, `r` becomes `a[3]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
