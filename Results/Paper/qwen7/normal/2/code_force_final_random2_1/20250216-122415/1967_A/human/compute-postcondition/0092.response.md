Let's break down the initial state and the expression to be printed step by step:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `ii` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `r` is the last element of the list `a` (`a[n-1]`).
   - `rem` is 0.
   - `y` is 1.

2. **Expression to Evaluate:**
   \[
   (r - 1) \times n + 1 + rem + y
   \]

3. **Substitute Known Values:**
   - `r` is the last element of the list `a` (`a[n-1]`). Since `n` is greater than 1, `r` is the last element of the list `a`.
   - `rem` is 0.
   - `y` is 1.

4. **Simplify the Expression:**
   \[
   (r - 1) \times n + 1 + 0 + 1 = (r - 1) \times n + 2
   \]

5. **Final Expression:**
   \[
   (r - 1) \times n + 2
   \]

Given that `r` is the last element of the list `a`, and `n` is greater than 1, the expression will evaluate to `(last_element_of_a - 1) * n + 2`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **(last_element_of_a - 1) * n + 2**
