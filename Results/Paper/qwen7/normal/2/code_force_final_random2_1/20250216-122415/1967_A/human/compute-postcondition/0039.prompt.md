Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained by mapping each element from the input split by spaces to an integer, `r` is the first element of the list `a`, `y` is 0, `rem` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, n - 1):
    if (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k:
        r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
        rem = k % (i + 1)
        y = n - 1 - i
        k = 0
        break
    else:
        k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])
        r = a[i + 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `r` is either `a[0] + k // (0 + 1)` or `a[i + 1]` depending on the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, and `k` is adjusted accordingly (either 0 or `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is either 3 or 2, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `r` is either `a[2]` when `i` is 2 or `a[3]` when `i` is 3, `rem` is 0 when `i` is 2 or `k % 3` when `i` is 3, `y` is `n - 2` when `i` is 2 or `n - 3` when `i` is 3, and `k` is adjusted to either 0 or `k - 4 * (a[3] - a[2])` based on the condition in the if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 4, `k` is adjusted based on the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` being true or false. If the condition is true, `r` is `a[3] + 0 // 4`, `rem` is `0 % 4`, `y` is `n - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is false, `k` is decreased by the value `(3 + 1) * (a[4] - a[3])`, and `r` is equal to `a[4]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
