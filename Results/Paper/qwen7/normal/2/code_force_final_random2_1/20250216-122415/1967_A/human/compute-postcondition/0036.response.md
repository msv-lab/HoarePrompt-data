Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is decreased by the value `(3 + 1) * (a[4] - a[3])`, `r` is equal to `a[4]`**.

Explanation: The variable `r` is assigned the value of `a[i + 1]`. Since `i` is 3, `i + 1` equals 4, so `r` is set to `a[4]`. The value of `k` is decreased by the value of `(3 + 1) * (a[4] - a[3])`, but the specific value of `k` after this operation is not provided, so we only note the decrease. The initial value of `i` remains unchanged.
