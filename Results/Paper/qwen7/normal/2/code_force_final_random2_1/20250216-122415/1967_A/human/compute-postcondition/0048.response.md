Output State: **`ii` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input from the user, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to the variables `n` and `k`. The variable `ii` was initially set to 1 and remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated states are that `ii` is 1, `n` is an input integer, and `k` is an input integer.
