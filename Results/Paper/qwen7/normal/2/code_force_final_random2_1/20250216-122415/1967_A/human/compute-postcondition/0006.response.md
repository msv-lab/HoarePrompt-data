Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained by mapping each element from the input split by spaces to an integer, `r` is the first element of the list `a`, `y` is 0, `rem` is 0.**

The code simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `y`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `r`, and `rem`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
