Output State: **`ii` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is either `k - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])` if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) <= k`, or 0 if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, `r` is `a[0] + a[1]` in both cases, `rem` is `k % 5`, `y` is 0, `i` is 4, `r` is `a[4] + k // 5`**.

Explanation: The code calculates the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1`, which is 5. So, `rem` is updated to `k % 5`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
