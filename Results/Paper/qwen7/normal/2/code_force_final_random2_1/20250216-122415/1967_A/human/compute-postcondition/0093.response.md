Postcondition: **`ii` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `k` is 0, `r` is the last element of the list `a` (`a[n-1]`), `rem` is 0, `y` is 1.**

Explanation: If `k` is not 0, the loop continues to decrement `k` by the difference between consecutive elements until `k` becomes 0 or the loop condition is no longer met. At this point, `i` will be `n - 2`, `k` will be adjusted to `a[n-1] + k // n`, and other variables will be set accordingly. If `k` is already 0, the loop does not execute, and `i` remains `n - 1`, `k` is 0, `r` is the last element of the list `a`, and other variables remain unchanged.
