Output State: **`ii` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `rem` is `k % 3`**

Explanation: The code `rem = k % (i + 1)` calculates the remainder when `k` is divided by `(i + 1)`. Given that `i` is 2, `(i + 1)` is 3. So, `rem` is assigned the value of `k % 3`. The values of `ii`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
