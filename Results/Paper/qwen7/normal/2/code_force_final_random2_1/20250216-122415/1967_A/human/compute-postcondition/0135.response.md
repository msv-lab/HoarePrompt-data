Output State: `ii` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is 0, `r` is the last value of `a` in the list, `rem` is 0, `y` is `n - 1 - i` where `i` is `n - 1`, and `i` is `n - 1`.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `ii` remains unchanged at 2. The variable `n` must initially be greater than 1. The variable `k` is reduced to 0 after processing all elements in the list `a`. The variable `r` will hold the value of the last element in the list `a`. The variable `rem` remains 0 as it is only set based on the value of `k` which becomes 0 eventually. The variable `y` is calculated as `n - 1 - i` with `i` being the last index processed, which is `n - 1`. The variable `i` reaches the value `n - 1` after the loop completes.
