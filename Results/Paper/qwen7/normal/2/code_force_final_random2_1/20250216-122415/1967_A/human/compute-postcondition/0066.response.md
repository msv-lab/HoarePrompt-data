Postcondition: **`ii` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is adjusted according to whether `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` holds true. If it does, `k` becomes 0 and `r` is set to `a[0]`. Otherwise, `k` is reduced by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is updated to `a[i + 1]`, and `rem` remains 0 while `y` and `i` reset to 0.**
