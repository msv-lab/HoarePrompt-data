Output State: **`ii` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is either `k - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])` if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) <= k`, or 0 if `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, `r` is `a[0] + a[1]` in both cases, `rem` is `k % 5`, `y` is 3, `i` is 4, `r` is `a[4] + k // 5`**

Explanation: The code `y = n - 1 - i` updates the value of `y` by subtracting 1 from `i` and then subtracting that result from `n`. Given the initial state where `i` is 4, `y` is updated to `n - 1 - 4` which simplifies to `n - 5`. Since `n` must be greater than 1, `y` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
