Output State: **`ii` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `r` is `a[n-1]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to a string, and then maps them to integers, storing the resulting list in the variable `a`. The values of `ii`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `r`, `rem`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
