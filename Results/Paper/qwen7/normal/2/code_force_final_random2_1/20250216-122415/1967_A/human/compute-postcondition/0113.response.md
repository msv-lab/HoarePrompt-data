Postcondition: **`ii` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is adjusted based on the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` being greater than or equal to `k`. If the condition is true, `i` is 2, `r` is `a[1]`, `rem` is `k % 2`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `n - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `i` is 0, `r` is `a[0] + a[1]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, and we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
