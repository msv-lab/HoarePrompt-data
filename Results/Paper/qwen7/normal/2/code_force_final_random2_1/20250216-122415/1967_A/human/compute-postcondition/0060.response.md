Output State: **`ii` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, the first element of `a` is `r`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, `i` is 0, `r` is `a[0] + k // (i + 1)`**.

Explanation: The line `k = 0` sets the value of `k` to 0. All other variables retain their previous values as no other assignments or operations are performed on them. Therefore, the updated values are as stated above.
