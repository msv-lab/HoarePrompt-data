The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it sorts the list `a` and then iterates through it to find the maximum possible value `r` that can be achieved by distributing `k` among the elements of `a`. If `k` cannot be fully distributed, it calculates the remaining value `rem` and the count `y` of elements that can still receive additional values. Finally, it prints the result based on the distribution of `k` and the values of `r`, `rem`, and `y`.
