Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `0` to `n-1`, so `i` ranges from `0` to `n-2`.
3. **Initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ii` is 1
   - `n` is greater than 1
4. **Loop body**:
   - If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `k` is set to 0 and `r` is set to `a[0]`.
   - Otherwise, `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is set to `a[i + 1]`, `rem` is set to 0, `y` is set to 0, and `i` is set to 0.

5. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`, if the loop is to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Given that `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` would be `2`.
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`ii` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2**
