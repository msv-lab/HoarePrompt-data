Postcondition: **After the if-else block executes, `i` is equal to `n-2`. The variable `r` is set to `a[n-1] + k // n` if the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` is never met for any `i`, otherwise `r` is set to `a[i+1]` where the condition is first met. The variable `rem` is 0, and `y` is `2` if the loop does not break, otherwise it is `n-1-i`. The variable `k` is 0 if the loop breaks due to the condition being met, otherwise it is reduced by the sum of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` for all iterations where the condition is not met.**
