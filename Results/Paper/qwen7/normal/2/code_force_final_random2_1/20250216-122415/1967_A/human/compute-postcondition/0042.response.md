Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is equal to `n-2`.
   - `r` is set to `a[n-1]` if the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` is never met for any `i`, otherwise `r` is set to `a[i+1]` where the condition is first met.
   - `rem` is 0.
   - `y` is `2` if the loop does not break, otherwise it is `n-1-i`.
   - `k` is 0 if the loop breaks due to the condition being met, otherwise it is reduced by the sum of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` for all iterations where the condition is not met.
   - `r` is now equal to `a[n-1] + k // n`.

2. **Code to Analyze:**
   ```python
   print((r - 1) * n + 1)
   ```

Given the initial conditions, let's analyze the possible scenarios for `r`:

- If the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` is never met for any `i`, then `r` is set to `a[n-1]`.
- Otherwise, `r` is set to `a[i+1]` where the condition is first met.

Since `i` is `n-2`, the only possible values for `i+1` are `n-1`. Therefore, the condition simplifies to checking if `(n-1) * (a[n-1] - a[n-2]) > k`.

However, since `k` is initially 0 and `rem` is 0, the condition will always be checked starting from the last element. If the condition is never met, `r` will be `a[n-1]`. If the condition is met, `r` will be set to `a[n-1]` because the condition will be checked only once (at `i = n-2`).

In both cases, `r` will be `a[n-1]`.

Next, let's consider the value of `k`:
- If the condition is never met, `k` remains 0.
- If the condition is met, `k` will be reduced by the sum of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` for all iterations where the condition is not met. Since the condition is met only once, `k` will be reduced by `(n-1) * (a[n-1] - a[n-2])`.

Finally, `r` is updated to `a[n-1] + k // n`.

Since `k` is either 0 or reduced by `(n-1) * (a[n-1] - a[n-2])`, `k // n` will be 0 if `k` is 0 or a small integer if `k` is non-zero.

Therefore, `r` will be `a[n-1]` plus 0 or a small integer, but the exact value of `r` depends on the specific values of `a[n-1]` and `k`.

Given this, the expression `(r - 1) * n + 1` will be:
- `(a[n-1] - 1) * n + 1` if `k` is 0.
- `(a[n-1] + (k // n) - 1) * n + 1` if `k` is non-zero.

Since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we can only say that `r` is `a[n-1]` plus a small integer, and the final expression will be slightly more than `(a[n-1] - 1) * n + 1`.

Output: **(a[n-1] - 1) * n + 1**
