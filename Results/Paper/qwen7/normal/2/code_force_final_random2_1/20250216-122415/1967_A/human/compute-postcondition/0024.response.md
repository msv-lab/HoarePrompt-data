Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` is greater than 2; `a` is a list of integers; `r` is `a[2]`; `rem` is 0; `y` is `n - 2`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. All the other variables retain their initial or previously calculated values.
