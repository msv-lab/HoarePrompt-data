Output State: **`ii` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is 0, `r` is `a[4]`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 3, `i` is 4 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block immediately surrounding the `break` statement, it implies that the `break` is part of a larger context that is not shown. However, based on the given variables and their values, none of them are directly affected by the `break` statement. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged, and the only effect is that we break out of the implied loop or conditional block.
