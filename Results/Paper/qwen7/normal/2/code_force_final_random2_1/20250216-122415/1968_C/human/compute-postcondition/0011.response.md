Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be at least 2
   - `a` contains two elements where `a[0]` is `a[0] - T[0]` and `a[1]` is `a[0] - T[0] - T[1]`

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n):`
   - This means `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`.

3. **Current State of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.

4. **Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently 2, the loop can execute one more time if `n` is greater than 2.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration, so `i` will become 3.
   - `n` must remain at least 2 for the loop to continue.

6. **State Adjustment:**
   - `i` changes to 3.
   - `n` must still be at least 2.
   - The value of `a` does not change within the loop head, so it remains the same.

Therefore, the adjusted states for the start of the next iteration are:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be at least 2, `a` contains two elements where `a[0]` is `a[0] - T[0]` and `a[1]` is `a[0] - T[0] - T[1]`**
