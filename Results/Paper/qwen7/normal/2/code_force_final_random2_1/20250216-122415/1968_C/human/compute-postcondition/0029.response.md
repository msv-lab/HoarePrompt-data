Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values and conditions**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is `t - 1`.
   - `result` is `'1000'`.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
   - `line` is the input provided by the user.
   - `T` is a list of integers obtained by converting each element of `line.split()` to an integer.
   - `a` is `[1000, a[1] - T[1], a[1] - T[1] - T[0]]`.

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - The loop condition is `for i in range(1, n)`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was in the range `[1, n-1]`. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be `2` (since it starts from `1` and increments by `1`).
   - `n` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration because the loop condition does not change `n`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**State:**
- `t` remains the same (`t - 1`).
- `result` remains `'1000'`.
- `i` is now `2`.
- `n` must still be greater than or equal to 2.
- `line` remains the same.
- `T` remains the same.
- `a` remains the same.

So, the final state is:
State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `result` is `'1000'`, `i` is `2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `line` is the input provided by the user, `T` is a list of integers obtained by converting each element of `line.split()` to an integer, `a` is `[1000, a[1] - T[1], a[1] - T[1] - T[0]]`**
