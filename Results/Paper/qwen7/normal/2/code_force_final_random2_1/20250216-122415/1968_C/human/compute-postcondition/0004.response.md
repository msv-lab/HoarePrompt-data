Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10000 - 1, `n` is an input integer, a new variable `line` is assigned the value of the input provided by the user.**

The code `line = input('')` reads a line of input from the user and assigns it to the variable `line`. Since `t` and `n` are not affected by this operation, their states remain unchanged.
