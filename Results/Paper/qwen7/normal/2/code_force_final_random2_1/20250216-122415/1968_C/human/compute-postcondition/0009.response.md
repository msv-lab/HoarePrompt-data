Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be at least 2
   - `a` contains an element which is equal to `a[0] - T[0]`

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and the loop continues as long as `i < n`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged and must still be at least 2.
   - The state of `a` does not change because it is not mentioned as being affected by the loop.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `n` must still be at least 2.
   - The state of `a` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `a` contains an element which is equal to `a[0] - T[0]`**
