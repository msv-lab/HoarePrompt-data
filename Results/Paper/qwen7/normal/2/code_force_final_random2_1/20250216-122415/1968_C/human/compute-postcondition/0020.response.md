Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `result` is a string containing the string representations of all elements of `a` separated by spaces, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of the integer input from the user. The values of `t` and `result` remain unchanged except for the decrement of `t` by 1 as per the initial state description. Therefore, `t` becomes `t - 1`. The value of `result` remains as described in the initial state.
