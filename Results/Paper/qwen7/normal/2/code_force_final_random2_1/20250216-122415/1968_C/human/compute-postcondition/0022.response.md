Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `result` is a string containing the string representations of all elements of `a` separated by spaces, `n` is an input integer, `line` is the input provided by the user, `T` is a list of integers obtained by converting each element of `line.split()` to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `T = list(map(int, line.split()))` converts each element of the string `line` (which is the input provided by the user) into an integer and stores these integers in a list called `T`. The variables `t`, `result`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
