Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-2`, `n` must be at least 2, `a` contains `n` elements where `a[0]` is `a[0] - T[0]`, `a[1]` is `a[0] - T[0] - T[1]`, and so on until `a[n-1]` which is `a[n-2] - T[n-2]`, and `a` is reversed.**

Explanation: The code `a = a[::-1]` reverses the list `a`. Since the original list `a` had elements calculated based on the formula given, reversing it means the first element now corresponds to what was originally the last element, the second element to what was originally the second last, and so on. The value of `i` is updated to `n-2` because the loop has run `n-1` times, and after the reversal, the next operation would start from the second last element.
