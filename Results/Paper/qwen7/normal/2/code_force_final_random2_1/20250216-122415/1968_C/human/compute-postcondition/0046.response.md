Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - `a` is updated such that its last element is now the value of the element before the last one minus the value of `T` at the index before the last one.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n):`.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 until `i < n`.
   - Since `n` must be greater than 2, the loop will run at least once (when `i = 1`).

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been incremented from `1` to `2` (since it starts at `1` and increments by `1`).
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 2.

5. **Updated State:**
   - `i` is now `2`.
   - `n` must still be greater than 2.

Given these points, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2**
