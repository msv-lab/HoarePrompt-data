Output State: **`t` is 0, `result` is '1000', `n` must be at least 2, `line` remains as the initial input provided by the user, `T` remains as the list of integers obtained by converting each element of `line.split()` to an integer, `a` is a list starting with 1000, followed by `n-1` elements, each computed as the previous element minus the corresponding value in `T`, and `result` is now a string containing the elements of the list `a` joined by spaces.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is decremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 0. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
