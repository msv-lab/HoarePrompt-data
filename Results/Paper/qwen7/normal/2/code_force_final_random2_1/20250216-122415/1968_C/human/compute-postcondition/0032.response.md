Output State: `t` is `t - 1`, `result` is '1000', `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `line` is the input provided by the user, `T` is a list of integers obtained by converting each element of `line.split()` to an integer, `a` is a list starting with 1000 followed by `n-1` elements where each element is calculated as `a[i-1] - T[i-1]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be `t - 1`, `result` will still be '1000', `n` must be at least 2, `line` and `T` will remain as they were initially, and `a` will be a list starting with 1000, followed by `n-1` elements, each computed as the previous element minus the corresponding value in `T`.
