Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - `i` starts from 1 because `range(1, n)` means `i` will take values from 1 up to (but not including) `n`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2 (since `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`).

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 so that the loop can start executing.
   - `i` should be set to 1 as per the loop initialization.

5. **Consider Other Variables**:
   - `t`, `line`, `T`, and `a` are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `i`.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2**
