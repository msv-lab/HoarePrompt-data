Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i`, `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive), meaning `i` starts at `1` and increments by `1` until it reaches `n-1`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is `t - 1`
   - `result` is `'1000'`
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to `2`
   - `line` is the input provided by the user
   - `T` is a list of integers obtained by converting each element of `line.split()` to an integer
   - `a` is `[1000, a[i-1] - T[i-1]]`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop starts from `1` and increments by `1`, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be `1`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be `2`.
   - The value of `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `t` is updated to `t - 1` (from the previous iteration).
   - `result` remains `'1000'` (no change in the loop head).
   - `n` remains the same (greater than or equal to `2`).
   - `line` remains the same (input provided by the user).
   - `T` remains the same (list of integers obtained by splitting `line`).
   - `a` is updated to `[1000, a[1] - T[1]]` because `i` is now `2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `result` is `'1000'`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `2`, `line` is the input provided by the user, `T` is a list of integers obtained by converting each element of `line.split()` to an integer, `a` is `[1000, a[1] - T[1]]`**
