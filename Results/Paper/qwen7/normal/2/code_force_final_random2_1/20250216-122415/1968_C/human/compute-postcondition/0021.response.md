Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `result` is a string containing the string representations of all elements of `a` separated by spaces, `n` is an input integer, `line` is the input provided by the user.**

Explanation: The code `line = input('')` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `line`. The other variables (`t`, `result`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
