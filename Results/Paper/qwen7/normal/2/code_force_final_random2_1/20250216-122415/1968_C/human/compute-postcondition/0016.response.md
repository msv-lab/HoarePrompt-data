The code `result = ' '.join(map(str, a))` does the following:

1. It maps each element of the list `a` to a string using `map(str, a)`.
2. It joins these string representations of the elements with a space `' '` as the separator.

Since the initial state of `a` is defined such that `a[i]` is `a[i-1] - T[i-1]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1`, and `a[0]` is `a[0] - T[0]`, and `a` is reversed, let's denote the elements of `a` as follows:

- `a[0] = a[0] - T[0]`
- `a[1] = a[0] - T[0] - T[1]`
- ...
- `a[n-1] = a[n-2] - T[n-2]`

After applying `map(str, a)` and joining them with spaces, the resulting string `result` will contain the string representations of all elements of `a` separated by spaces.

Output State: **`result` is a string containing the string representations of all elements of `a` separated by spaces.**
