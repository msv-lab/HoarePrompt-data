Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `result` is '1000', `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `line` is the input provided by the user, `T` is a list of integers obtained by converting each element of `line.split()` to an integer, `a` is `[1000, a[1] - T[1], a[1] - T[1] - T[0]]`**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `a`. The new element is calculated as `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`, where `i` is the length of the list `a`. Initially, `a` is `[1000, a[1] - T[1]]`. After appending, `a` becomes `[1000, a[1] - T[1], a[1] - T[1] - T[0]]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
