Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `a` is updated such that its last element is now the value of the element before the last one minus the value of `T` at the index before the last one.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])` appends to the list `a` a new element which is the result of subtracting the value of `T` at index `i-1` from the value of `a` at index `i-1`. However, since the indices `i` and `T` are not defined in the given context, we can only infer that `a` is updated in this manner while keeping the condition that `n` must be greater than 1.
