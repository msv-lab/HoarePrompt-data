Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (number of elements in the list `x` + 1), and a list `x` of `n-1` integers. For each test case, it calculates a new list `a` based on the input values and prints a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.**
