Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains `_` and `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `int(input())` returns a value. This means that the loop will run once for each integer input provided by the user.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `n` is the first integer input by the user.
   - `k` is the second integer input by the user.

4. **Determine the next input**: After the previous iteration, the user has already provided two inputs (`n` and `k`). For the loop to execute one more time, the user must provide another integer input.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - The variable `t` remains unchanged because it was not used in the loop.
   - The variable `n` remains unchanged because it was not used in the loop.
   - The variable `k` remains unchanged because it was not used in the loop.
   - The loop will now wait for the next input from the user, which will be assigned to the variable defined in the loop (which is `_` in this case, but since it is an underscore, it is typically ignored).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is the first integer input by the user, `k` is the second integer input by the user**.
