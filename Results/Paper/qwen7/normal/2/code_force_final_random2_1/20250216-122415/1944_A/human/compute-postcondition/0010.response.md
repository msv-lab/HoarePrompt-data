Output State: The loop will continue to execute as many times as specified by the user through the input. After all iterations, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), and for each iteration, there are corresponding values of `n` and `k` provided by the user, where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(0 \leq k \leq \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2}\). The final output state will include all these inputs and their respective processed results from the loop.

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes all its iterations, `t` will still be within the range of 1 to 1000, and for each iteration, there will be a pair of integers `n` and `k` that were input by the user, along with the result of the loop's processing for those pairs.
