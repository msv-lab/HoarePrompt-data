Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `k` is greater than or equal to `n-1`. In such cases, destroying `n-1` bridges would isolate island 1 from all other islands. However, the current implementation always prints 1 if `n - k > 1`, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the input:
```
4 3
```
Here, `n = 4` and `k = 3`. Destroying 3 bridges can isolate island 1 from all other islands, so the correct output should be 1. However, the program incorrectly outputs 4 because `n - k` is not less than or equal to 1.

To fix this, the condition should be adjusted to ensure that if `k >= n - 1`, the output is 1. The corrected code would look like this:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)
```

This ensures that the program handles all potential cases correctly.
