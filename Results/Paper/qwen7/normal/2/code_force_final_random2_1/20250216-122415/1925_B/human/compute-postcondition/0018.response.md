Postcondition: **`x` is an integer, `i` is a divisor of `x` and `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is the maximum value between the previous value of `ans` and `x // i`, and `n` must be greater than `x // (i + 1)` if `i + 1` is a divisor of `x`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same as the if part.**
