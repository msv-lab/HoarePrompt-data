Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the maximum balance of a problemset, which is defined as the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the difficulties of all sub-problems.
2. The annotated program initializes the number of test cases (`tc`) and iterates through each test case.
3. For each test case, it reads `x` and `n` from input.
4. The function `func_1()` calculates the maximum balance as follows:
   - It initializes `ans` to 0.
   - It iterates over all integers `i` from 1 to the square root of `x` (inclusive).
   - If `x` is divisible by `i`, it checks two conditions:
     - If `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, it updates `ans` to be the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
     - If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, it updates `ans` to be the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

To verify correctness, we need to check if this approach correctly finds the maximum GCD for any given `x` and `n`.

### Verification:

- **Divisors and GCD**: The GCD of a set of numbers is the largest number that divides all of them without leaving a remainder. By iterating over all divisors of `x` and checking the conditions, the program effectively finds the largest divisor that can be used to split `x` into `n` parts while maximizing the GCD.
- **Conditions**: 
  - `n <= x // i`: This ensures that we can split `x` into at least `n` parts, each with a difficulty of `i`.
  - `n <= i`: This ensures that we can split `x` into exactly `n` parts, each with a difficulty of `x // i`.

Given these points, the logic in the code is sound and should correctly find the maximum balance.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance of the problemset. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
