Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), and for each `t`, two positive integers `x` and `n` (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x). The function processes these inputs and returns different outputs based on the values of `x` and `n` for each test case.**

Given the constraints, the function likely iterates over a series of test cases defined by `t`, and for each test case, it processes `x` and `n` to produce some form of output, though the specific output is not detailed in the given information.
