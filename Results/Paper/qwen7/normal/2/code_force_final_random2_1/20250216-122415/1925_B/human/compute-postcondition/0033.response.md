To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **x**: An integer.
2. **i**: Defined as `isqrt(x) + 1`. Here, `isqrt(x)` is the integer square root of `x`, which is the greatest integer less than or equal to the square root of `x`.
3. **ans**: The maximum value of `i` or `x // i` for all divisors `i` of `x` such that `n` is less than or equal to `x // i` or `i`.

Given the expression for `ans`, it means that `ans` will be the maximum value between `i` and `x // i` for all valid divisors `i` of `x`.

However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `x` or `n`. Therefore, we need to consider the general form of the expression for `ans`.

- If `x` is a perfect square, then `isqrt(x) = sqrt(x)`, and `i = sqrt(x) + 1`.
- For any divisor `i` of `x`, `x // i` will be another divisor of `x`.

Given that `ans` is the maximum value of `i` or `x // i` for all valid divisors, and considering the properties of divisors, `ans` will be the largest divisor of `x` that satisfies the condition `n <= x // i` or `i`.

Since the exact value of `x` and `n` are not specified, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `ans`. However, we can describe the value of `ans` in terms of the properties of `x` and `n`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the maximum value of i or x // i for all divisors i of x such that n is less than or equal to x // i or i)**
