Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `c` will be equal to `casos - 1`, `casos` will still be the initial input integer (which must be a positive integer), and `n` will be the last input integer that was processed within the loop. The values printed during each iteration depend on the value of `n` for that specific iteration, but all such prints will have occurred by the end of the loop's execution.

This means that the final state of the variables will reflect the completion of the loop where `c` has reached its maximum possible value (`casos - 1`), and `n` holds the value of the last input provided to the loop.
