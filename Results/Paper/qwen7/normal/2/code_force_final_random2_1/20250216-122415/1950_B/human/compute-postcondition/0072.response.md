Postcondition: **`c` is 1, `casos` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is an input integer that is either equal to 1 or not equal to 2, and `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition `n == 1` is true or false, the values of `c`, `casos`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states as specified in the precondition.
