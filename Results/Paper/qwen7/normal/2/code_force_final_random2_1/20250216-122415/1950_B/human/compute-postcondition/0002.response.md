Output State: **`c` is 0, `casos` must be a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it takes an integer input from the user. The other variables, `c` and `casos`, remain unchanged with their initial states.
