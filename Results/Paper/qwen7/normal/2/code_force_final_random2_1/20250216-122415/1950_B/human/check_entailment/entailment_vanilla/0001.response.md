### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to generate a 2n x 2n checkerboard where each 2x2 block alternates between `#` and `.`. The top-left cell should be `#`.

2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`casos`) and processes each test case individually.

3. **Checkerboard Generation**:
   - For `n = 1`, the output is correct.
   - For `n = 2`, the output is correct.
   - For `n = 3`, the output is correct.
   - For `n = 4`, the output is correct.
   
4. **Handling Larger Values**: The program incorrectly handles values of `n` greater than 4 by printing "No esta en el rango" (which translates to "Not in the range"). However, the problem description does not specify how to handle values outside the range [1, 4]. Since the problem asks for a 2n x 2n checkerboard and provides examples for `n = 1, 2, 3, 4`, we can assume that the checkerboard pattern should be extended logically for larger `n`.

5. **Pattern Extension for Larger `n`**:
   - For `n > 4`, the checkerboard pattern should repeat the 4x4 pattern in a consistent manner. The existing code does not extend this pattern correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not provide a generalized solution for `n > 4`. It only handles specific cases up to `n = 4` and fails to extend the pattern logically for larger values of `n`.

### Response:
Correctness: **False**
