### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the problem description step-by-step to verify the correctness of the provided solution.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find a sequence \(a\) of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
- The sequence must not have any subsequence with a sum of \(k\).
- For all \(1 \le v \le n\) where \(v \ne k\), there must be a subsequence of \(a\) with a sum of \(v\).

#### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(k\).

2. **Sequence Construction:**
   - The program initializes a list `nums` with the first 21 powers of 2: \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]\).
   - It finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \(k\) and stores its index in `idx`.
   - It appends \(k - 2^{idx}\) and \(k + 1\) to the list.
   - It removes \(2^{idx}\) from the list.
   - Finally, it prints the length of the list and the list itself.

3. **Function Summary Recap:**
   - The function processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it constructs a specific list of numbers and prints its length and contents.
   - The function does not return any value but prints the list for each test case.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- **Condition 1: No Subsequence Summing to \(k\):**
  - The sequence constructed by the program ensures that no subsequence sums to \(k\). This is because \(k - 2^{idx}\) and \(k + 1\) are added, and \(2^{idx}\) is removed. The remaining elements in the list do not include \(k\), and the newly added elements ensure that no subsequence sums to \(k\).

- **Condition 2: Subsequences Summing to All \(1 \le v \le n\) where \(v \ne k\):**
  - The sequence includes all powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\), which covers a wide range of sums. By removing \(2^{idx}\) and adding \(k - 2^{idx}\) and \(k + 1\), the program ensures that all sums from 1 to \(n\) (except \(k\)) can be formed using the remaining elements.
  - The elements \(2^{idx}\), \(k - 2^{idx}\), and \(k + 1\) are carefully chosen to ensure that all required sums are possible.

Given the analysis, the program correctly constructs a sequence that meets both conditions specified in the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the given function summary.
