Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly address the problem requirements. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Constraints and Requirements**:
   - The solution generates a list of powers of 2 (`[1 << i for i in range(21)]`), which means it creates a list of numbers `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^20]`. This approach doesn't ensure that no subsequence sums to `k` while still allowing all sums from `1` to `n` (excluding `k`) to be formed.
   
2. **Logic Flaw**:
   - The logic of finding an index `idx` where `nums[idx] > k` and then appending `k - nums[idx]` and `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` is flawed. It does not guarantee that no subsequence will sum to `k` and also does not ensure that all sums from `1` to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed.

3. **Removing Elements**:
   - Removing `(1 << idx)` from the list after appending other values is unnecessary and does not solve the problem.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to construct a sequence that meets both conditions:
- No subsequence should sum to `k`.
- All other sums from `1` to `n` (excluding `k`) should be possible.

One correct approach could involve using a combination of powers of 2 and ensuring that `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence. Here's a revised version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        # Generate a sequence that avoids k and includes all other sums
        nums = []
        for i in range(1, 21):
            num = 1 << i
            if num != k:
                nums.append(num)
        # Ensure all sums from 1 to n (excluding k) can be formed
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if i != k:
                nums.append(i)
                break
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)

func()
```

This approach ensures that:
- No subsequence sums to `k` because `k` is not included in the sequence.
- All other sums from `1` to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed by the combination of the elements in the sequence.

Thus, the original program is incorrect, and the provided solution does not meet the problem requirements.
