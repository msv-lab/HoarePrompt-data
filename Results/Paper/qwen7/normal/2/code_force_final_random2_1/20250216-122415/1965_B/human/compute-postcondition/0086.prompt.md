Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. The values of `n` and `k` remain undefined, and the sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 10^7.
Code of the loop:
for tc in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    i = 0
    while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
        i = i + 1
    ans = [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]
    for j in range(20):
        if j != i:
            ans.append(1 << j)
    print(len(ans))
    print(*ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all 20 iterations, `j` will be 20, `i` remains 31, `tc` remains 0, `n` remains the input integer, `k` remains 2147483648, and `ans` is a list containing the values generated by the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `j` is 20, `i` is 31, `tc` is 1, `n` is the original input integer, `k` is 2147483648, `ans` is a list containing the values [2147483647, 2147483649, 2147483650, ..., 1048576].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `j` is 0, `i` is 31, and `ans` is a list containing the values `[1 << 0, 1 << 1, 1 << 2, ..., 1 << 18]`.

In natural language: After the loop executes all 20 iterations, the variable `j` will have reached 0 (since it starts at 19 and decrements by 1 each iteration until it reaches 0). The variable `i` remains unchanged at 31. The list `ans` will contain 20 elements, each being `1 << j` for `j` ranging from 0 to 19, inclusive. This means `ans` will contain the values `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
