Output State: `j` is 0, `i` is 31, `tc` is 2, `n` is the original input integer, `k` is 2147483648, and `ans` is a list containing the values `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288]`.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `j` will have reached 0 (since it starts at 19 and decrements by 1 each iteration until it reaches 0). The variable `i` remains unchanged at 31. The variable `tc` will be 2 because the loop has completed two full iterations over the test cases. The variables `n` and `k` remain the same as their initial values from the first iteration, as they are not redefined within the loop. The list `ans` will contain 20 elements, each being `1 << j` for `j` ranging from 0 to 19, inclusive, which are the powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{19}\).
