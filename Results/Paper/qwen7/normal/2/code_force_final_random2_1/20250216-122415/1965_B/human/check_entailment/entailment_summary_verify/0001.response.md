### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program and its correctness based on the provided problem description and the function summary.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`.

2. **Generating Sequence:**
   - The program initializes a list `nums` with powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\).
   - It finds the index `idx` of the first power of 2 greater than `k`.
   - It appends `k - nums[idx]` to `nums`.
   - It appends `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` to `nums`.
   - Finally, it removes `1 << idx` from `nums`.

3. **Output:**
   - The length of the modified list `nums` is printed.
   - The elements of `nums` are printed.

### Verification Against Problem Requirements:

1. **No Subsequence Summing to `k`:**
   - The sequence includes `k - nums[idx]` and `k + nums[idx] + 1`. Since `nums[idx]` is a power of 2, the sum of any subset of `nums` will either include `k - nums[idx]` or `k + nums[idx] + 1`, making it impossible to form a subsequence that sums exactly to `k`.

2. **Subsequences Summing to All Values from 1 to `n` Except `k`:**
   - The sequence includes all powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\) and additional values like `k - nums[idx]` and `k + 1`.
   - By combining these values, it is possible to form subsequences that sum to any value from 1 to `n` except `k`.

3. **Sequence Length:**
   - The maximum length of the sequence is 25 because the initial list `nums` has 21 elements, and we add at most 4 more elements (including the removal of one element).

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Powers of 2:**
  - The sequence includes all powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\), which allows forming any sum using these values.
  - Adding `k - nums[idx]` ensures that any value from 1 to `k-1` can be formed.
  - Adding `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` ensures that any value from `k+1` to `2^{20} + k + 1` can be formed.
  - Removing `1 << idx` ensures that the exact sum `k` cannot be formed.

- **Handling Edge Cases:**
  - The sequence generation logic ensures that the constraints are met for all values from 1 to `n` except `k`.
  - The sequence length is within the limit of 25, as required.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly generates a sequence that meets the problem requirements. It ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while allowing all other values from 1 to `n` to be formed as subsequences.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
