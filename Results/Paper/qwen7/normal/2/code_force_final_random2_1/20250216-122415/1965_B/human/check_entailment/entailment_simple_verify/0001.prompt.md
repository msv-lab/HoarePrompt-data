You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(21)]
        idx = -1
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > k:
                idx = i - 1
                break
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, n and k are positive integers satisfying 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^7.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(21)]
        
        idx = -1
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):

                idx = i - 1

    #State: Output State: The loop will execute for each test case provided by the user. After all iterations, `idx` will be set to the index where `2^idx` is just greater than `k` for the last test case processed. The `nums` list will contain specific elements derived from `k` and the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`. Specifically, `nums` will include `[2, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 1048577, k + nums[idx] + 1]` for the last test case. The length of `nums` will be printed for each test case, and the final list `nums` will be printed out after all test cases have been processed. The variable `t` will remain unchanged as it was in the initial state, and `n` and `k` will retain their values from the last test case processed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which indicates the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Generating Sequence:**
   - The program initializes a list `nums` with powers of 2 up to \(2^{20}\) (i.e., `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^20]`).
   - It finds the index `idx` of the first power of 2 greater than `k`.
   - If `nums[i] > k`, it sets `idx = i - 1` and breaks the loop.
   - This ensures that `nums[idx]` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.

3. **Modifying List:**
   - The program appends `k - nums[idx]` to `nums`.
   - It also appends `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` to `nums`.
   - Finally, it removes `1 << idx` from `nums`.

4. **Output:**
   - The length of the modified list `nums` is printed.
   - The elements of `nums` are printed.

### Verification Against Problem Requirements:

1. **No Subsequence Summing to `k`:**
   - The sequence includes `k - nums[idx]` and `k + nums[idx] + 1`. Since `nums[idx]` is a power of 2, the sum of any subset of `nums` will either include `k - nums[idx]` or `k + nums[idx] + 1`, making it impossible to form a subsequence that sums exactly to `k`.

2. **Subsequences Summing to All Values from 1 to `n` Except `k`:**
   - The sequence includes all powers of 2 up to `2^20` and additional values like `k - nums[idx]` and `k + 1`.
   - By combining these values, it is possible to form subsequences that sum to any value from 1 to `n` except `k`.

3. **Sequence Length:**
   - The maximum length of the sequence is 25 because the initial list `nums` has 21 elements, and we add at most 3 more elements.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly generates a sequence that meets the problem requirements. It ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while allowing all other values from 1 to `n` to be formed as subsequences.

Correctness: **True**
