Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(len(nums))`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `len(nums)`.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 21. This means that the loop has already iterated over all elements in `nums` because `range(len(nums))` would stop when `i` reaches `len(nums) - 1`.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(nums)`. Since `i` is currently 21, the loop will not execute again because `21 >= len(nums)` (assuming `len(nums)` is less than 21).

4. **Adjusting the State**: Since the loop condition is not met (`i` is not less than `len(nums)`), the state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time. The loop will terminate because `i` has reached its upper limit.

Therefore, the state remains unchanged.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 21, `nums[i]` is compared with `k` (though this comparison will not occur since the loop will not execute again)**
