Output State: **`i` is 23, `idx` is 21, `nums` contains an element equal to `k - nums[idx] + 1`**

Explanation: The code appends `k + 1` to the list `nums`. Since `nums` previously contained an element equal to `k - nums[idx]`, after appending `k + 1`, the new condition for `nums` is that it contains an element equal to `k - nums[idx] + 1`. The values of `i` and `idx` remain unchanged.
