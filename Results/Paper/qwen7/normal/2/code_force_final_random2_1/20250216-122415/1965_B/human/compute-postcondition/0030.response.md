Output State: **`idx` is 2, `t` must be an integer within the range 1 to 1000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), `i` is equal to 21, `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input split into two integers, and `nums` is updated to include elements \((1 << 20)\), \((1 << 21)\), and \((1 << 22)\).**

Explanation: The code `nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(21)]` generates a list of integers where each element is \(2^i\) for \(i\) ranging from 0 to 20. This list is then updated to include additional elements \((1 << 20)\), \((1 << 21)\), and \((1 << 22)\), which are already present in the original list. Therefore, the list `nums` remains unchanged in terms of its content but is explicitly mentioned to include these elements. All other variables retain their initial or updated states as described.
