Output State: **y is 3, x is n - 1, a is the first element of the list l, b is the element at index 3 in list l, and c is 0.**

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `y` will be equal to `n - 1` because the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`. The value of `x` remains `n - 1` as it is not modified within the loop. The variable `a` remains the first element of the list `l` since it is not changed by the loop. The variable `b` is set to the value of `l[y]` (which is `l[n-1]`) when the condition `l[y] > l[y - 1]` is met for the last time, but since the loop breaks immediately upon finding such an index, `b` retains the value of `l[3]` if the condition was met at `y=3`. If the condition was never met, `b` remains `0`. The variable `c` remains `0` as it is not modified within the loop.
