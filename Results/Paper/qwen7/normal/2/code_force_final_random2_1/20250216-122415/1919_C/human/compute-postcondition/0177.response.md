Output State: `y` is `-1`, `x` is `n - 1`, `a` is the minimum value found in list `l` between indices 0 and `n-1` (inclusive), `b` is the maximum value found in list `l` between indices 0 and `n-1` (inclusive), and `c` is the count of elements in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the range from `y + 1` to `n`. Given that `y` starts at `n - 1` and decreases by 1 each iteration, it will eventually reach `-1` after `n` iterations.
- The variable `x` will take the value of `n - 1` after the last iteration since the loop increments `x` within its range.
- Variable `a` is updated to the minimum value in `l` when `l[x]` is less than `a`, ensuring it holds the smallest value encountered.
- Variable `b` is updated to the maximum value in `l` when `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, ensuring it holds the largest value encountered.
- The variable `c` counts how many elements in `l` are greater than both `a` and `b`, which is incremented only once per such element, based on the provided output states.
