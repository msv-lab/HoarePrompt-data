Output State: **`y` is 2, `x` is `n - 1`, `a` is the first element of the list `l`, `b` is the element at index 2 in list `l`, and `c` is 0; `b` is now the element at index 2 in list `l`, which was previously stored in `l[y]`.**

In this case, the code `b = l[y]` assigns the value at index `y` (which is 2) in the list `l` to the variable `b`. Since `y` is 2, `b` is now set to the element at index 2 in the list `l`. All other variables remain unchanged.
