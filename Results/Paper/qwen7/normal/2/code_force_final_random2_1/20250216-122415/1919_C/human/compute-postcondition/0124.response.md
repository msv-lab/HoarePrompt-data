Postcondition: `y` is `n - 2`, `n` must be greater than `n - 1`, the element at index `x` in list `l` is less than `a` and less than `b`, and the difference between `a` and the element at index `x` in list `l` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and the element at index `x` in list `l`.
