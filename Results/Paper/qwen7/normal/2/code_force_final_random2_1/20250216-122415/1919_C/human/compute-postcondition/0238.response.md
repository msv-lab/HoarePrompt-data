Postcondition: `y` is 3, `x` is 5, `n` must be at least 5, `a` is the first element of the list `l`, `b` is the element at index 3 in the list `l`, `c` is 0. If `l[5] - a` is greater than or equal to `l[5] - b`, then `a` remains the first element of the list `l`. Otherwise, `a` becomes the element at index 5 in the list `l`.
