Output State: **`y` is 3, `x` is `n - 1`, `a` is the first element of the list `l`, `b` is the element at index 3 in list `l`, `c` is 0**

Explanation: The code `b = l[y]` assigns the value at index `y` of list `l` to variable `b`. Given that `y` is 3, `b` now holds the element at index 3 of list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged.
