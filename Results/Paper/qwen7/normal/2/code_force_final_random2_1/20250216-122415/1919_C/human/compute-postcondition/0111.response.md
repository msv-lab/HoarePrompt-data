Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `x`, `y`, and `n`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `x` in the range from `y + 1` to `n` (inclusive).
3. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - `y` must be initialized to a value such that the loop can start. Since the loop starts at `y + 1`, `y` must be less than `n - 1` (because the loop will run at least once if `y` is less than `n - 1`).
   - `n` must be greater than `y + 1` to ensure the loop can execute at least once.
   - `b` is a variable that might change during the loop, but its initial value doesn't affect the loop's execution. We don't need to adjust `b` for the loop to start.

Given the postconditions:
- `y` is equal to `n - 1`.
- `b` is the maximum value found in the list `l` between indices 1 and `n - 1` (inclusive), or remains as its initial value if no such element is found to be greater than the previous one.

Since the loop starts at `y + 1`, `y` must be `n - 2` to allow the loop to start at `n - 1`. Therefore, we need to ensure `y` is `n - 2` and `n` is greater than `y + 1`.

So, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `y` should be `n - 2`.
- `n` must be greater than `y + 1` (which means `n > n - 1` or simply `n > n - 2`).

State: **`y` is `n - 2`, `n` must be greater than `n - 1`**
