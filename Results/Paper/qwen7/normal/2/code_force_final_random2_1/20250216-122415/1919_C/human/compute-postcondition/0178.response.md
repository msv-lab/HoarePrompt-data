Output State: **Postcondition: `y` is `-1`, `x` is `n - 1`, `c` is the total number of times the condition `l[x] > a and l[x] > b` was met during the loop's execution.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `y` will be decremented until it reaches `-1` because the loop starts from `y + 1` and increments `x` in each iteration. The variable `x` will eventually reach `n - 1` since the loop continues as long as `x` is less than `n`. The variable `c` will count the number of times an element in the list `l` between `y + 1` and `n - 1` is greater than both `a` and `b`, updating `a` and `b` accordingly.
