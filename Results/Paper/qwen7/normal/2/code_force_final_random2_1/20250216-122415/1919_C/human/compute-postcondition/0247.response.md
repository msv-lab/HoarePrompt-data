Postcondition: `y` is 3, `x` is 5, `n` must be at least 5, `a` is the first element of the list `l`, `b` is the element at index 3 in the list `l`, and `c` is 0. If the condition `l[x] < a and l[x] < b` is true, then `a` remains the first element of the list `l`. Otherwise, `a` becomes the first element of the list `l`.
