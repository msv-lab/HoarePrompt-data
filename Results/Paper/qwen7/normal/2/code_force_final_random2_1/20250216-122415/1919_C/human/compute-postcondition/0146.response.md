Output State: **`c` is `1`, `y` is `n - 2`, `x` is `n - 1`, if `l[x] - a` is greater than or equal to `l[x] - b`, then `a` is the value of `l[x]`. Otherwise, `b` is the value of `l[x]`.**

Explanation: The code `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. Initially, `c` was not specified, so it is now set to 1. The values of `y` and `x` remain unchanged as they were part of the postcondition and not affected by the code. The condition involving `l[x]`, `a`, and `b` also remains unchanged.
