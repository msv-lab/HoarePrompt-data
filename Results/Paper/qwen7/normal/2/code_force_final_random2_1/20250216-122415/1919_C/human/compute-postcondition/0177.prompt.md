Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Postcondition: `y` is equal to `n-1`, and `b` is the maximum value found in list `l` between indices 1 and `n-1` (inclusive), or remains as its initial value if no such element is found to be greater than the previous one.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(y + 1, n):
    if l[x] > a and l[x] > b:
        if l[x] - a >= l[x] - b:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
        c += 1
    elif l[x] < a and l[x] < b:
        if a - l[x] <= b - l[x]:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
    elif a >= l[x]:
        a = l[x]
    else:
        b = l[x]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `y` is `n - 2`, `n` must be greater than `n - 1`. After the execution of the if-else block, the element at index `x` in list `l` is either set to `a` if `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`, or set to `b` if `b - l[x]` is less than `a - l[x]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `y` is `n - 2`, `x` is `n - 1`. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `a` is the value of `l[x]` if `l[x] - a` is greater than or equal to `l[x] - b`; otherwise, `b` is the value of `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, and `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`, then the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `a - l[x]` is greater than `b - l[x]`, `b` is updated to the value of `l[x]`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, `b` is set to `l[x]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `y` is `n - 2`, `x` is `n - 1`, `c` is `1`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` remains `1`. Otherwise, if `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, and the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is less than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`, then the condition holds true. Otherwise, if `a` is greater than `l[x]`, then `a` remains unchanged and `b` is set to the value of `l[x]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
