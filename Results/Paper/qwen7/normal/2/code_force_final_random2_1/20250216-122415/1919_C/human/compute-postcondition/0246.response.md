Postcondition: **`y` is 3, `x` is 5, `n` must be at least 5, `a` is the element at either index 5 or the first element in the list `l`, `b` is the element at index 3 in the list `l`, and `c` is 0. If `a` is greater than or equal to the element at index `x` (which is the element at index 5), then `a` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `a` becomes the first element of the list `l`.**
