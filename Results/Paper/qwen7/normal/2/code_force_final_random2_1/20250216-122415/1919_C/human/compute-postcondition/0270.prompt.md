Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: y is 3, x is n - 1, a is the first element of the list l, b is the element at index 3 in list l, and c is 0.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(y + 1, n):
    if l[x] > a and l[x] > b:
        if l[x] - a >= l[x] - b:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
        c += 1
    elif l[x] < a and l[x] < b:
        if a - l[x] <= b - l[x]:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
    elif a >= l[x]:
        a = l[x]
    else:
        b = l[x]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `y` is 3, `x` is `n - 1` where `n` must be at least 5, `a` is the first element of the list `l`, `b` is the element at index 3 in the list `l`, `c` is 0. If the element at index `x` in the list `l` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `c` becomes 1 and the element at index `x` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `c` remains 0, and `l[x]` is adjusted to either `b` or the previous value of `l[x]` based on the condition that the difference between `a` and `l[x]` is greater than or equal to the difference between `b` and `l[x]`. In the end, `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a` and `b` if `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]` is true, otherwise `l[x]` is greater than or equal to `a` and `b` if `b` is greater than or equal to `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `y` is 3, `x` is 5, `n` must be at least 5, `a` is the first element of the list `l`, `b` is the element at index 3 in the list `l`, and `c` is 0. If `l[5] > a` and `l[5] > b`, then `a` is updated to `l[5]`. Otherwise, `a` remains the same as the first element of the list `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `y` is 3, `x` is 6, `n` must be at least 6, `a` is the first element of the list `l`, and `c` is 0. If `l[6] > a` and `l[6] > b`, then `a` becomes `l[6]`. Otherwise, `a` remains the first element of the list `l`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
