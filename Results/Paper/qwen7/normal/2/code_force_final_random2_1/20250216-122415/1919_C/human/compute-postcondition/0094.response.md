Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for y in range(1, n):`. The objects involved here are `y` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `y` is initialized to 1 in the loop head (since `range(1, n)` starts from 1).
   - `n` is given as an integer input value.

3. **Adjust the states based on the loop head**:
   - Since `y` is set to 1 in the loop head, we need to ensure that `y` is indeed 1.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1 because `range(1, n)` will not produce any values if `n` is 1 or less.

4. **Consider the current state of other variables**:
   - `a` is the first element of list `l`.
   - `c` is 0.
   - `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `b` is 0.
   - `y` is currently 0 (not relevant for the loop head).

5. **Formulate the final state**:
   - We need to ensure `y` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`y` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
