Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head defines the variables `y` and `n`. These are the only variables that can be adjusted based on the loop condition.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `y = 1` to `y < n`. This means that at the start of each iteration, `y` will be incremented by 1.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `y` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than 1.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop starts with `y = 1` and increments `y` by 1 at the start of each iteration, the next value of `y` will be `2`.
   - The condition `y < n` must still hold true for the loop to continue. Given that `n` is greater than 1, `y = 2` will satisfy this condition as long as `n` is at least 3 (since `y` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`).

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - `y` will be incremented to 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`y` is 2, `n` is greater than 1**
