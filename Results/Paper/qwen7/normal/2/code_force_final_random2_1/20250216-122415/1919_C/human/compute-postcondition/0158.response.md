Postcondition: `y` is `n - 2`, `x` is `n - 1`. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `a` is the value of `l[x]` if `l[x] - a` is greater than or equal to `l[x] - b`; otherwise, `b` is the value of `l[x]`. If `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b`, and `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`, then the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `a - l[x]` is greater than `b - l[x]`, `b` is updated to the value of `l[x]`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, `b` is set to `l[x]`.
