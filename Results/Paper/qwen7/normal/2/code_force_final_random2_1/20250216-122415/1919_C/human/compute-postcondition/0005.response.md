Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is the first element of the list `l`, `b` is 0, `c` is 0.**

In this case, the code simply assigns the value `0` to the variable `c`. Since `n`, `l`, `a`, and `b` were unaffected by this line of code, their states remain the same.
