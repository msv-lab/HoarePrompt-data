Postcondition: `y` is 3, `x` is `n - 1`, `a` is either the first element of the list `l` or `l[n - 1]`, `b` is either the element at index 3 in the list `l` or `l[x]`, and `c` is 0. If `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, then `a` remains as it is. Otherwise, `a` becomes the first element of the list `l` and `b` becomes `l[x]`.
