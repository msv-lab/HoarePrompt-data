Output State: **`y` is `n - 2`, `x` is `n - 1`, `a` is the value of `l[x]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `l[x]` to the variable `a`. Here, `x` is equal to `n - 1`. So, `a` will hold the value of the element in list `l` at index `n - 1`. The values of `y` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
