Postcondition: `x` is `y + 1`, `x` must be less than `n`. After the execution of the if-else block, the current value of `l[x]` is either equal to `a` and greater than `b`, or equal to `b` and the difference between `l[x]` and `a` is less than the difference between `l[x]` and `b`. In the first case, the difference between `l[x]` and `a` is 0 and still greater than or equal to the difference between `l[x]` and `b`. In the second case, `b` is now equal to `l[x]`.
