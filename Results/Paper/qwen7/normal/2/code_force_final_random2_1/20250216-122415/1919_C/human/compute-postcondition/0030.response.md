Output State: **`x` is `y + 1`, `x` must be less than `n`, the current value of `l[x]` is equal to `b`, the difference between `l[x]` and `a` is less than the difference between `l[x]` and `b`, and `b` is now equal to `l[x]`**.

Explanation: The value of `b` is updated to be equal to `l[x]`. All other conditions and relationships involving `x`, `y`, `n`, `l[x]`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from the initial state.
