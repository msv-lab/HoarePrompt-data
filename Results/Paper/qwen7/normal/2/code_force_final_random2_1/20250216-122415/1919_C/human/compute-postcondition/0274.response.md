Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, …, a_n`. The integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) is an external constraint on the number of test cases. The function returns a result based on the given test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. The function processes each test case according to the provided constraints and returns a specific result for each one.
