Postcondition: `x` is `y + 3`, `y` remains the same, `n` remains the same, and `l[x]` is updated to either `a` or `b` based on the following conditions: if `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `l[x]` is set to `a` if `l[x] - a` is greater than or equal to `l[x] - b`, otherwise `l[x]` is set to `b`. If `l[x]` does not satisfy `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then `l[x]` is updated to `a` if `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`, otherwise `l[x]` is set to `a` if `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, otherwise `l[x]` is set to `b`.
