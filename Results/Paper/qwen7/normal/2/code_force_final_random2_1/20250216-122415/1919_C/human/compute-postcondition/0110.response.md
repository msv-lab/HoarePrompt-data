Output State: **Postcondition: `y` is equal to `n-1`, and `b` is the maximum value found in list `l` between indices 1 and `n-1` (inclusive), or remains as its initial value if no such element is found to be greater than the previous one.**

Explanation: The loop iterates from `y = 1` to `y = n-1`. During each iteration, it checks if the current element `l[y]` is greater than the previous element `l[y-1]`. If it finds such an element, it assigns `l[y]` to `b` and breaks out of the loop. After all iterations, `y` will be `n-1` (the last index the loop checked). The variable `b` will hold the first element found that is greater than its predecessor, or it will retain its initial value if no such element exists.
