Output State: **`y` is 3, `x` is 5, `n` must be at least 5, `a` is the element at index 5 in the list `l`, `b` is the element at index 3 in the list `l`, `c` is 0**

Explanation: The code `a = l[x]` assigns the element at index `x` (which is 5) in the list `l` to the variable `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
