Output State: **`y` is `n - 2`, `x` is `n - 1`, `b` is the value of `l[x]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `l[x]` to the variable `b`. Given that `x` is `n - 1`, `b` will take the value of the element at index `n - 1` in the list `l`. The values of `y` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
