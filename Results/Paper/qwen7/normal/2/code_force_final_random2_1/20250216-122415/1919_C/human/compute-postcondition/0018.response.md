Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the `for y in range(1, n):` statement. The variables involved here are `y` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `y` is less than `n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` must be at least 1.
   - `y` is currently 2.
   - The current value of `l[2]` is equal to the previous value of `b`.
   - The current value of `l[1]` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `y` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `y` was 2.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `y` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - The value of `n` does not change within the loop body unless explicitly modified, so `n` remains the same.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `y` will be 3.
   - `n` remains unchanged (it must still be at least 1).
   - The values of `l[2]` and `l[1]` remain unchanged as per the postcondition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`n` must be at least 1, `y` is 3, the current value of `l[2]` is equal to the previous value of `b`, and the current value of `l[1]` remains unchanged.**
