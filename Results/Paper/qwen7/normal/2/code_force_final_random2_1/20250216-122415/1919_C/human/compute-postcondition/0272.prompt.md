Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case contains an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = l[0]
    b = 0
    c = 0
    y = 0
    for y in range(1, n):
        if l[y] > l[y - 1]:
            b = l[y]
            break
    for x in range(y + 1, n):
        if l[x] > a and l[x] > b:
            if l[x] - a >= l[x] - b:
                a = l[x]
            else:
                b = l[x]
            c += 1
        elif l[x] < a and l[x] < b:
            if a - l[x] <= b - l[x]:
                a = l[x]
            else:
                b = l[x]
        elif a >= l[x]:
            a = l[x]
        else:
            b = l[x]
    print(c)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations of the loop, `y` will be equal to `n`, `b` will hold the maximum value found in the list `l` where `l[y] > l[y - 1]` was true, and `a`, `c`, and `l` will retain their final states from the last iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `y` is `-1`, `x` is `n - 1`, `c` is the total number of times the condition `l[x] > a and l[x] > b` was met during the loop's execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: y is 3, x is n - 1, n must be at least 7, a is the maximum value among the first, third, and any value greater than both a and b encountered during the loop, b is the second maximum value among the first, third, and any value greater than both a and b encountered during the loop, and c is the count of elements in the list l that are greater than both a and b.

In this final state, `y` remains 3 because it is not modified within the loop. `x` will be `n - 1` since the loop increments `x` from `y + 1` (which is 4) until it reaches `n - 1`. The variable `a` will hold the maximum value found in the list `l` that is also greater than both the initial `a` and `b`. Similarly, `b` will hold the second maximum value found under the same conditions. The variable `c` will count how many elements in the list `l` are greater than both `a` and `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
