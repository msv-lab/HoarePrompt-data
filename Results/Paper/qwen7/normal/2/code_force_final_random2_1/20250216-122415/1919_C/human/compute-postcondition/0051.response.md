Postcondition: `x` is `y + 1`, `x` is less than `n`, and `l[x]` is either equal to `a` or `b`. If `l[x]` is greater than both `a` and `b`, then `l[x]` is updated to either `a` or `b` based on which one is closer (i.e., if `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`, `l[x]` is set to `a`; otherwise, `l[x]` is set to `b`). If `l[x]` is less than or equal to both `a` and `b`, then `l[x]` is updated to either `a` or `b` based on which one is closer (i.e., if `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`, `l[x]` is set to `a`; otherwise, `l[x]` is set to `b`). If `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, then `l[x]` is set to `a`; otherwise, `l[x]` is set to `b`.
