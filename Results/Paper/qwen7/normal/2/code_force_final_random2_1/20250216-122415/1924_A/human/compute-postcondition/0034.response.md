Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: a string `s`, an integer `k`, and an integer `n`. It returns a boolean indicating whether the length of `s` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, a substring of `s` starting from index `r * k` and going to the end, and a string `s2` containing each unique character from `s` that was in the set `alphabet`.**
