Output State: **`s1` is an empty string, `s` is a non-empty string of length `m`, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 26 and 1 <= `k` <= 26, and 1 <= `m` <= 1000; `s2` is a string which is initially empty; `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets except for `i`, and the length of `alphabet` is `k-1`.**

Explanation: The code `alphabet.remove(i)` removes the element `i` from the set `alphabet`. Since `i` is one of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, after removing `i`, the set `alphabet` will contain the remaining `k-1` alphabets. All other variables remain unchanged.
