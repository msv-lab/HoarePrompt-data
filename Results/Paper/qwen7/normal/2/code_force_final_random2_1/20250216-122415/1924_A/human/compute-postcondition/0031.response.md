Output State: **`s1` is the original string `s` concatenated with itself, `s2` is the string formed by concatenating every unique character from `s` that was in the set `alphabet` (each character repeated once), and `alphabet` is an empty set.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `s1` will contain the original string `s` repeated once because each character of `s` is appended to `s1` in each iteration. The variable `s2` will contain a string where each unique character from `s` that was originally in `alphabet` is included once, as characters are removed from `alphabet` one by one until it becomes empty. Since `alphabet` starts with all the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and characters are removed based on their presence in `s`, `s2` will end up with each unique character from `s` that was in `alphabet` repeated once. Finally, `alphabet` will be an empty set since all its elements are removed during the loop iterations.
