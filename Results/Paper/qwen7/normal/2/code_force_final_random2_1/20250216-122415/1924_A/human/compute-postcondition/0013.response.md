Output State: **`s1` is now the string `s`, `s` is a non-empty string of length `m`, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 26 and 1 <= `k` <= 26, and 1 <= `m` <= 1000; `s2` is either the string 'i' or remains empty; `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.**

Explanation: The code `s1 += i` appends the character `i` to the end of the string `s1`. Since `s1` was initially an empty string, after appending `i`, `s1` becomes the string `s`. All other variables remain unchanged.
