Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a string `s`, an integer `k`, and an integer `n`.
   - It initializes an empty string `s1` and another empty string `s2`.
   - It also creates a set `alphabet` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - For each character in `s`, if the character is in `alphabet`, it removes the character from `alphabet` (if `alphabet` has more than one character) or appends the character to `s2` (if `alphabet` has only one character).
   - The character is always appended to `s1`.
   - After processing the string `s`, it calculates `r` as the length of `s1` divided by `k` and returns a tuple containing:
     - A boolean indicating if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`.
     - A substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end.
     - The string `s2`.

2. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` and stores the result.
   - If the boolean value returned by `func_1` is `False`, it means not all possible strings of length `n` can be found as subsequences in `s`.
     - In this case, it prints 'No' and generates a string `be9i` consisting of the first available character in `alphabet` repeated `n - len(s2)` times.
     - It then appends `s2 + be9i` to the output list `OUT`.
   - If the boolean value is `True`, it prints 'Yes'.

3. **Issues Identified**:
   - The logic in `func_1` does not correctly determine if all possible strings of length `n` can be found as subsequences in `s`.
   - Specifically, `func_1` does not check if all possible combinations of length `n` from the first `k` alphabets exist as subsequences in `s`.
   - Instead, it checks if the concatenated string `s1` (which is essentially `s` repeated) has enough characters to form `n * k` characters, which is not relevant to the problem statement.
   - The generation of `s2` and the calculation of `r` do not contribute to solving the actual problem.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
