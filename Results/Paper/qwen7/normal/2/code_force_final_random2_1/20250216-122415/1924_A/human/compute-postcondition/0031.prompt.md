Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s1` is an empty string, `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 26 and 1 <= `k` <= 26, and `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 1000; `s2` is an empty string; `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i in alphabet:
        if len(alphabet) != 1:
            alphabet.remove(i)
        else:
            s2 += i
            alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
        s1 += i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s1` is the string `s`, `s2` is either the string 'i' or remains empty, and `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. If `i` is in the set `alphabet`, `s2` becomes the string 'i'. Otherwise, `s2` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `s1` is the string `s` concatenated with `i`; `s2` is either the string 'i' or remains unchanged; `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. If `len(alphabet)` is not equal to 1, `alphabet` does not contain the character `i`. Otherwise, `s2` becomes the string `'i'` concatenated with `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s1` is the string `s` up to the current character plus the current `i`, `s2` is either the string 'i' or the string 'i' concatenated with itself, `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets minus the element `i` if `len(alphabet) != 1`, otherwise `s2` is the string 'i' concatenated with itself.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
