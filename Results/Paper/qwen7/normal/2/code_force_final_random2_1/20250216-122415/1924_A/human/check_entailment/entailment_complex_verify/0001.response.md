### Reasoning:

The original assessment identified several issues with the program, particularly focusing on the generation of the missing subsequence. Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m` followed by the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function constructs two strings, `s1` and `s2`.
     - `s1` is built by including characters from `s` that are in the set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
     - `s2` is built by taking every `k`th character from `s1` after removing duplicate characters.
   - It checks if `s1` has at least `n * k` characters. If so, it returns `True` and the appropriate substrings; otherwise, it returns `False` and the substrings.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic checks the output of `func_1`.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, it prints "No" and generates a string of length `n` using characters not present in `s1`.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints "Yes".

### Detailed Evaluation:

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Construction of `s1`:**
  - `s1` is constructed by concatenating the original string `s` with itself. This ensures that all characters in `s` are included twice, which helps in checking subsequences more thoroughly.
- **Construction of `s2`:**
  - `s2` is constructed by taking every `k`th character from `s1` after removing duplicates. This helps in identifying the unique characters and their positions in `s1`.
- **Check Length:**
  - The function checks if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`. If it is, it means all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets can be found as subsequences in `s`.

#### Main Logic:
- **Checking and Generating Missing Subsequence:**
  - If `func_1` returns `False`, the program tries to generate a string of length `n` using characters not present in `s1`. However, the current approach of finding the first character `i` that is not in `s1` and creating a string of length `n` using this character might not always work. This is because it only considers one character at a time, and it doesn't ensure that the generated string is lexicographically minimal or maximal.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Character Generation for Missing Subsequence:**
   - The current approach of finding the first character `i` that is not in `s1` and creating a string of length `n` using this character might not always produce the correct missing subsequence. The generated string should be lexicographically minimal or maximal, which is not ensured by the current implementation.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function `func_1` does not handle edge cases well, such as when `s` is very short or when `k` is large compared to `n`.

### Example Test Case Analysis:
Let's consider the provided examples to see if the program works correctly:

#### Example 1:
- Input: 
  ```
  3
  2 2 4
  abba
  2 2 3
  abb
  3 3 10
  aabbccabab
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  YES
  NO
  aa
  NO
  ccc
  ```

- **Test Case 1:**
  - `n = 2`, `k = 2`, `s = 'abba'`
  - `func_1` will correctly identify that all possible strings of length 2 using 'a' and 'b' are subsequences of 'abba'.
  - Output: `YES`

- **Test Case 2:**
  - `n = 2`, `k = 2`, `s = 'abb'`
  - `func_1` will identify that 'aa' is not a subsequence of 'abb'.
  - Output: `NO` and `'aa'`

- **Test Case 3:**
  - `n = 3`, `k = 3`, `s = 'aabbccabab'`
  - `func_1` will identify that 'ccc' is not a subsequence of 'aabbccabab'.
  - Output: `NO` and `'ccc'`

### Conclusion:
The program seems to handle the examples correctly but has issues with generating the correct missing subsequence. The current implementation might not always produce the lexicographically smallest or largest missing subsequence as required by the problem.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

The original assessment was accurate in identifying the issues with the program. The current implementation does not ensure that the generated missing subsequence is lexicographically minimal or maximal, which is a requirement of the problem.

Final: **False**
