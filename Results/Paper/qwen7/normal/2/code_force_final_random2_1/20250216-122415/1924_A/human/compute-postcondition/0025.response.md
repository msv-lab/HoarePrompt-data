Output State: **`s1` is the string `s` up to the current character plus the current `i`, `s2` is either the string 'i' or remains unchanged, `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets minus the element `i`.**

Explanation: The code removes the element `i` from the set `alphabet`. The values of `s1` and `s2` remain unchanged. The set `alphabet` now contains all its original elements except for `i`.
