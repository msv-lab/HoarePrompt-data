Output State: **`s1` is the string `s`, `s2` is either the string 'i' or remains unchanged, and `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets with the character `i` removed.**

Explanation: The code removes the character `i` from the set `alphabet`. The values of `s1` and `s2` remain unchanged from their initial states. The set `alphabet` loses the character `i`.
