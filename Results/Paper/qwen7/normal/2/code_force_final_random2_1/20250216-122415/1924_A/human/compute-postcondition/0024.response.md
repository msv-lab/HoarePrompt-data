Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the string `s`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each character `i` in the string `s`.

3. **Postconditions from the Previous Iteration**:
   - `s1` is the string `s` concatenated with `i`.
   - `s2` is either the string 'i' or remains unchanged.
   - `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - If `len(alphabet)` is not equal to 1, `alphabet` does not contain the character `i`. Otherwise, `s2` becomes the string `'i'` concatenated with `i`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each character `i` in `s`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the next character in `s`.
   - `s1` will be updated to include the current `i`.
   - `s2` will remain as it was if it was not changed to `'i' + i` in the previous iteration.
   - `alphabet` remains unchanged because the loop head does not modify it.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `s1` will be the string `s` up to the current character plus the current `i`.
   - `s2` will remain as it was unless the condition for `s2` changes (which would happen if `len(alphabet) == 1`).
   - `alphabet` remains the same.

Given the above analysis, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`s1` is the string `s` up to the current character plus the current `i`, `s2` is either the string 'i' or remains unchanged, `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.**
