Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m` followed by the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function aims to identify if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets can be found as subsequences in `s`.
   - It constructs two strings: `s1` and `s2`.
     - `s1` is built by including characters from `s` that are in the set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
     - `s2` is built by taking every `k`th character from `s1` after removing duplicate characters.
   - It checks if `s1` has at least `n * k` characters. If so, it returns `True` and the appropriate substrings; otherwise, it returns `False` and the substrings.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic checks the output of `func_1`.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, it prints "No" and generates a string of length `n` using characters not present in `s1`.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints "Yes".

### Issues Identified:
1. **Character Generation for Missing Subsequence:**
   - The code tries to generate a missing subsequence by finding the first character `i` that is not in `s1` and creating a string of length `n` using this character.
   - However, this approach might not always work because it only considers one character at a time, and it doesn't ensure that the generated string is lexicographically minimal or maximal, which is required by the problem statement.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function `func_1` does not handle edge cases well, such as when `s` is very short or when `k` is large compared to `n`.

### Example Test Case Analysis:
Let's consider the provided examples to see if the program works correctly:

#### Example 1:
- Input: 
  ```
  3
  2 2 4
  abba
  2 2 3
  abb
  3 3 10
  aabbccabab
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  YES
  NO
  aa
  NO
  ccc
  ```

- **Test Case 1:**
  - `n = 2`, `k = 2`, `s = 'abba'`
  - `func_1` will correctly identify that all possible strings of length 2 using 'a' and 'b' are subsequences of 'abba'.
  - Output: `YES`

- **Test Case 2:**
  - `n = 2`, `k = 2`, `s = 'abb'`
  - `func_1` will identify that 'aa' is not a subsequence of 'abb'.
  - Output: `NO` and `'aa'`

- **Test Case 3:**
  - `n = 3`, `k = 3`, `s = 'aabbccabab'`
  - `func_1` will identify that 'ccc' is not a subsequence of 'aabbccabab'.
  - Output: `NO` and `'ccc'`

### Conclusion:
The program seems to handle the examples correctly but has issues with generating the correct missing subsequence. The current implementation might not always produce the lexicographically smallest or largest missing subsequence as required by the problem.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
