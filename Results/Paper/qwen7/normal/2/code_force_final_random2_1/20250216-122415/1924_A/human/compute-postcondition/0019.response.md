Postcondition: `s1` is the string `s`, `s2` is either the string 'i' concatenated with `i` or remains unchanged, and `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets with the character `i` removed if `len(alphabet) != 1`. Otherwise, `s2` is the string `'i'` concatenated with `i`.
