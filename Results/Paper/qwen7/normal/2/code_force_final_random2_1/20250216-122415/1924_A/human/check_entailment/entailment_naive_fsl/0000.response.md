Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not properly handle the generation and checking of all possible subsequences of length `n`.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Consider the following input:
```
3
2 2 4
abba
2 2 3
abb
3 3 10
aabbccabab
```

For the third test case:
- `n = 3`, `k = 3`, `m = 10`, and `s = 'aabbccabab'`.
- All possible strings of length 3 that can be formed using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets ('a', 'b', 'c') are: 'aaa', 'aab', 'aac', 'aba', 'abb', 'abc', 'aca', 'acb', 'baa', 'bab', 'bac', 'bba', 'bbb', 'bbc', 'bca', 'bcb', 'caa', 'cab', 'cba', 'ccc'.
- The string 'ccc' is not a subsequence of 'aabbccabab'.

However, the program does not generate these strings and check their subsequences correctly. Instead, it uses a flawed approach to determine if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`.

The program should generate all possible strings of length `n` and check if they are subsequences of `s`, but it does not do this. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
