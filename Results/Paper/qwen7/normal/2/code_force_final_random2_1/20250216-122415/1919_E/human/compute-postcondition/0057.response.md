Output State: **`new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`, `i` remains `m + 1`**.

Explanation: The code updates `new_dp[j - 1]` by adding `dp[j]` to its current value and taking the result modulo `MOD`. This operation does not affect `i`, which remains `m + 1`. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
