Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for res in results:`. This means the loop iterates over each element in the `results` list.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `res` is the next element in `results`.
   - `t` is the total number of iterations (length of `results`).
   - `n` is the integer from `data[3]`.
   - `p` is the list of integers from the last iteration.
   - `data` remains unchanged.
   - `results` contains the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration.

3. **Understand the loop execution**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `res` is the current element being processed in the `results` list.
   - `t` is the length of `results`, indicating the total number of iterations.
   - `n` and `p` remain the same as they are not modified within the loop.
   - `data` remains unchanged.
   - `results` contains the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `res` will be the next element in the `results` list.
   - Since `t` is the length of `results`, it does not change during the loop.
   - `n` and `p` remain the same as they are not modified within the loop.
   - `data` remains unchanged.
   - `results` will contain the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, including the new element added in the next iteration.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `res` will be the next element in `results`.
   - `t` remains the same (length of `results`).
   - `n` remains the same (from `data[3]`).
   - `p` remains the same (from the last iteration).
   - `data` remains unchanged.
   - `results` will contain the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, including the new element.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`res` is the next element in `results`, `t` is the total number of iterations (length of `results`), `n` is the integer from `data[3]`, `p` is the list of integers from the last iteration, `data` remains unchanged, and `results` contains the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration.**

Since the exact value of `res` cannot be determined without knowing the specific elements in `results`, we can generalize the state as follows:

State: **`res` is the next element in `results`, `t` is the total number of iterations (length of `results`), `n` is the integer from `data[3]`, `p` is the list of integers from the last iteration, `data` remains unchanged, and `results` contains the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration.**
