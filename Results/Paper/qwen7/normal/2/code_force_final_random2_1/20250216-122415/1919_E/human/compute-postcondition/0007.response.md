Output State: **`index` is 3, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer obtained from `data[index]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers where |pi| â‰¤ `n` and sorted in non-decreasing order, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input using whitespace, `results` is an empty list**

Explanation: The code `n = int(data[index])` takes the value at the current index (`index` which is 2) from the `data` list, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `n`. After this assignment, `index` is incremented to 3 (since it typically increments after accessing an element in a list). All other variables remain unchanged.
