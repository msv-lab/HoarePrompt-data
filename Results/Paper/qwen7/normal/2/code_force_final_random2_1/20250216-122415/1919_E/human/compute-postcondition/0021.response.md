Output State: **`index` is 5 + 2n, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is now the integer value of `data[3]`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input using whitespace, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)` and the new result.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[index]` to `n`, where `index` is initially `5 + 2n`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[3]`. The rest of the conditions and values related to the variables `t`, `p`, `result`, `data`, and `results` remain the same as per the initial state.
