Functionality: **The function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls another function `func_1` for each test case. For each test case, it extracts the number of elements `n` and a list of integers `p`, then computes a result using `func_1`. After processing all test cases, it prints the results of each test case. The function does not return any value but modifies internal states such as `index`, `results`, and retains the last processed list `p`.**
