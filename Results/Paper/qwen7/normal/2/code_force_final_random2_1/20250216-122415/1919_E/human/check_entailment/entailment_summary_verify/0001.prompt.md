You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of size n consisting of only 1 and -1 . Let p be the
prefix sums of array a . More formally, p is an array of length n defined as
p_i = a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_i . Afterwards, array p is sorted in non-
decreasing order. For example, if a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] , then p = [1, 0, -1,
0, 1] before sorting and p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] after sorting.

You are given the prefix sum array p after sorting, but you do not know what
array a is. Your task is to count the number of initial arrays a such that the
above process results in the given sorted prefix sum array p . As this number
can be large, you are only required to find it modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the size of the hidden array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n
(|p_i| \le n ) — the n prefix sums of a sorted in non-decreasing order.

It is guaranteed that p_1 \le p_2 \le \ldots \le p_n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5000 .

Output

For each test case, output the answer modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Note

In the first two test cases, the only possible arrays a for n = 1 are a = [1]
and a = [-1] . Their respective sorted prefix sum arrays p are p = [1] and p =
[-1] . Hence, there is no array a that can result in the sorted prefix sum
array p = [0] and there is exactly 1 array a that can result in the sorted
prefix sum array p = [1] .

In the third test case, it can be proven that there is no array a that could
result in the sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 1, 2] .

In the fourth test case, the 3 possible arrays a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] are:

  * a = [1, -1, 1, -1, -1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, 1, 0, -1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, -1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [-1, 1, 1, -1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [-1, 0, 1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 

For the fifth test case, the only possible array a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1] is a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, 1] .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, p):
    dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)
    offset = n
    dp[offset] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        new_dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)
        for j in range(2 * n + 1):
            if dp[j] > 0:
                if j + 1 <= 2 * n:
                    new_dp[j + 1] = (new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
                if j - 1 >= 0:
                    new_dp[j - 1] = (new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
        dp = new_dp
    final_sum = p[-1] + offset
    return dp[final_sum]

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(n, p)
        results.append(result)
    for res in results:
        print(res)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls another function `func_1` for each test case. For each test case, it extracts the number of elements `n` and a list of integers `p`, then computes a result using `func_1`. After processing all test cases, it prints the results of each test case. The function does not return any value but modifies internal states such as `index`, `results`, and retains the last processed list `p`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function `func_1`:
This function aims to compute the number of possible initial arrays \(a\) that would result in the given sorted prefix sum array \(p\).

1. **Initialization**:
   - `dp` is initialized to `[0] * (2 * n + 1)` with an offset of `n`.
   - `dp[offset]` is set to `1`, indicating that there is one way to have a prefix sum of `0` at position `n`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Transition**:
   - A new DP array `new_dp` is created to store the updated values.
   - For each position `j` in the current DP array `dp`, if `dp[j]` is greater than `0`, it updates `new_dp[j+1]` and `new_dp[j-1]` by adding `dp[j]` to them.
   - This transition simulates the addition of `1` or `-1` to the prefix sum at each step.

3. **Final Sum Calculation**:
   - After the DP array is updated for all positions, the final sum is calculated as `p[-1] + offset`.
   - The value at `dp[final_sum]` is returned, which represents the number of ways to achieve the given sorted prefix sum.

#### Function `func_2`:
This function reads input from stdin and processes multiple test cases.

1. **Reading Input**:
   - Reads the entire input into a string and splits it into tokens.
   - Uses a counter `index` to parse the input data for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it extracts `n` and the list `p`.
   - Calls `func_1` with `n` and `p` to get the result.
   - Appends the result to the `results` list.

3. **Output**:
   - Prints the results for each test case.

### Verification

To verify the correctness of the program, we need to ensure that:
1. The dynamic programming approach correctly models the problem.
2. The transitions in the DP array are accurate.
3. The final sum calculation is correct.
4. The input processing and output formatting are correct.

Given the problem constraints and the nature of the problem, the provided solution seems to follow a valid approach. However, let's consider a few edge cases to ensure correctness:

1. **Single Element Array**: If `n = 1` and `p = [0]`, the only possible array `a` is `[1]`. The program should return `1`.
2. **Multiple Elements Array**: For more complex cases, the program should handle the transitions correctly and return the expected number of valid arrays.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code and considering the problem constraints, the provided solution appears to be correct. The dynamic programming approach accurately models the problem, and the transitions and final sum calculations are handled correctly.
