Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, for every index \(j\) from 1 to \(2 * n\), `new_dp[j]` will contain the sum of all `dp[k]` where `dp[k] > 0`, modulo `MOD`. This means that `new_dp[j]` will hold the total count of positive values in `dp` up to index `j`, considering the modulo operation. The value of `i` will remain `m + 1` throughout all iterations, and after the last iteration, `j` will be `0`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `new_dp` will store the cumulative sum of all non-zero elements in `dp` up to each index, taken modulo `MOD`. The variable `i` will stay constant at `m + 1`, and `j` will reset to `0` after the loop ends.
