### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes `n` and `p` as inputs.
   - It initializes a `dp` array of size `2 * n + 1` with all elements set to 0.
   - The element at index `offset` (which is `n`) is set to 1.
   - The function then iteratively updates the `dp` array based on the current values, spreading the values to adjacent indices.
   - After the loop, it calculates `final_sum` as `p[-1] + offset`.
   - Finally, it returns `dp[final_sum]`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` reads input from standard input and processes `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the sorted prefix sum array `p`.
   - It calls `func_1` with `n` and `p` and stores the result.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The problem requires counting the number of initial arrays `a` that can produce a given sorted prefix sum array `p`.
   - The solution uses dynamic programming to simulate the distribution of values in the prefix sum array.
   - The logic in `func_1` seems to correctly propagate the initial value (1) through the `dp` array, which should reflect the possible configurations of the array `a`.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The constraints are handled appropriately, with the size of `n` being up to 5000.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required bounds.

Given the analysis, the provided code appears to follow the correct approach to solve the problem. The dynamic programming logic in `func_1` and the overall structure of `func_2` seem to align with the requirements of the problem.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
