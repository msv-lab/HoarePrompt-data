Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for res in results:`. The variables involved here are `res` and `results`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `index` is `3 + 2t + n`, where `t` is the total number of iterations (length of `results`), and `n` is the integer from `data[3]`.
   - `t` is the length of `results`, which means `t` is the number of iterations completed so far.
   - `p` is the list of integers from the last iteration.
   - `data` remains unchanged.
   - `results` contains the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `results`, the variable `res` will take the value of each element in `results` one by one.
   - The state of `results` itself does not change within the loop; it remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - The variable `index` is not directly involved in the loop head, so its state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.
   - The variable `p` is not directly involved in the loop head either, so its state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.
   - The variable `data` remains unchanged, so its state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is the value of `res` which will be the next element in `results`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`res` is the next element in `results`, `t` is the total number of iterations (length of `results`), `n` is the integer from `data[3]`, `p` is the list of integers from the last iteration, `data` remains unchanged, and `results` contains the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration.**
