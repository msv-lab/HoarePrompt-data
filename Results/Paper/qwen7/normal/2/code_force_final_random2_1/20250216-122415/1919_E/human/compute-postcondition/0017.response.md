Output State: **`index` is 5 + 2n, `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input using whitespace, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)` plus the new result.**

Explanation: The value of `index` is incremented by `n`, making it `5 + n + n = 5 + 2n`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
