Output State: **`dp` is equal to `new_dp`, and the final state of `new_dp` will be determined by the cumulative effect of all positive values in `dp` being added to their respective neighboring indices in `new_dp` modulo `MOD`.**

Explanation: The line `dp = new_dp` assigns the value of `new_dp` to `dp`. This means that `dp` now holds the same values as `new_dp`. The precondition that the final state of `new_dp` will be determined by the cumulative effect of all positive values in `dp` being added to their respective neighboring indices in `new_dp` modulo `MOD` remains valid after the assignment.
