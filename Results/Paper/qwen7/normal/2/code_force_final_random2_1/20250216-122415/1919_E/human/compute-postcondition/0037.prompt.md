You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000 representing the size of the hidden array a; p is a list of n integers where |pi| ≤ n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(n, p)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: Output State: The `index` will be `3 + 2t + n`, where `t` is the final value after the loop completes all its iterations, and `n` is the integer value obtained from `data[3]`. The variable `t` will be equal to the total number of iterations the loop executed, which is an integer greater than or equal to 3 since we know it has already executed at least 3 times. The `t` value will be the sum of all `t` values from each iteration, meaning if the loop iterates `k` times, `t` will be `k`. The `n` value remains the same as it is derived from `data[3]` and does not change within the loop. The `p` list will be updated to the last list of integers obtained from converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers after the loop completes. The `data` list remains unchanged as no modifications are made to it within the loop. The `results` list will contain the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, with the latest result being the most recent addition to the list.
    #
    #In summary, the `index` will be `3 + 2t + n`, `t` will be the total number of iterations, `n` will be the integer from `data[3]`, `p` will be the list of integers from the last iteration, `data` will remain unchanged, and `results` will be a list of results from each iteration of the loop.
    for res in results:
        print(res)
        
    #State: The `index` will be `3 + 2t + n`, where `t` is the total number of iterations (length of `results`), `n` is the integer from `data[3]`, `p` is the list of integers from the last iteration, `data` remains unchanged, and `results` contains the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters but instead uses predefined variables t, n, and p. It processes these variables where t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000 representing the size of the hidden array a, and p is a list of n integers where |pi| ≤ n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order. The function then performs operations based on these variables but does not return any value.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
