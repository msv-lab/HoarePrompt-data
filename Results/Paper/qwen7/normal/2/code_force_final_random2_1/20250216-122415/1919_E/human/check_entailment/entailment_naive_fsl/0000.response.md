Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of initial arrays `a` that can result in the given sorted prefix sum array `p`. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not handle the logic for constructing valid prefix sums correctly. 

For instance, consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  4
  -2 -1 0 1
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  ```

- Actual Output (using the provided code):
  ```
  0
  ```

The expected output is 2 because there are two valid arrays `a` that can result in the sorted prefix sum array `p = [-2, -1, 0, 1]`:
1. `a = [-1, -1, 1, 1]`
2. `a = [-1, 1, -1, 1]`

However, the provided code does not account for these cases correctly. The `func_1` function seems to be attempting to simulate the construction of valid prefix sums using dynamic programming, but it does not properly handle the transitions between different values in the prefix sum array `p`.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
