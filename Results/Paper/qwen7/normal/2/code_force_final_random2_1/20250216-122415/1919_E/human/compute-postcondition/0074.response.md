Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the start of the loop**: At the end of the previous iteration, `new_dp` contains the cumulative sum of all positive values in `dp`, distributed across its indices from 1 to \(2 * n\), and `i` remains `m + 1`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was `m + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - The new value of `i` would be `m + 2`.

5. **Maintain the state of other variables**: The variable `new_dp` and the value of `n` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`new_dp` contains the cumulative sum of all positive values in `dp`, distributed across its indices from 1 to \(2 * n\), and `i` is `m + 2`**.
