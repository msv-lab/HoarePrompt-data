Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000 representing the size of the hidden array `a`; `p` is a list of `n` integers where |pi| ≤ `n` and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `input` is set to `sys.stdin.read`**.

The code `input = sys.stdin.read` does not change the values of the existing variables (`t`, `n`, `p`). Instead, it reassigns the `input` variable to refer to the function `sys.stdin.read`. This means that when input is called later in the program, it will read the entire input from standard input at once rather than line by line. The precondition values of `t`, `n`, and `p` remain unchanged.
