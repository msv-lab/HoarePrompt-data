Output State: **The `index` will be `3 + 2t + n`, where `t` is the total number of iterations (length of `results`), `n` is the integer from `data[3]`, `p` is the list of integers from the last iteration, `data` remains unchanged, and `results` contains the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration.**

In Natural Language: After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the `index` will be calculated as `3 + 2t + n`, where `t` represents the total number of iterations, which is the length of the `results` list. The value of `n` is the integer obtained from `data[3]` and remains constant throughout the loop. The `p` list will contain the integers from the last iteration of the loop. The `data` list will remain unchanged because no modifications were made to it inside the loop. The `results` list will contain the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, with the latest result being the most recent addition to the list.
