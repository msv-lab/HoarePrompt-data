Output State: **After the loop, `new_dp` contains the cumulative sum of all positive values in `dp`, distributed across its indices from 1 to \(2 * n\), and `i` remains `m + 1`.**

Explanation: The line `dp = new_dp` assigns the current state of `new_dp` back to `dp`. This means that `dp` now holds the same values as `new_dp` after the loop completed. The loop ensured that for every index \(j\) from 1 to \(2 * n\), `new_dp[j]` contained the sum of all `dp[k]` where `dp[k] > 0`, modulo `MOD`. Additionally, the value of `i` was not modified during the loop and remained `m + 1`. The variable `j` was reset to 0 after each iteration but did not affect the final state of `new_dp`. Therefore, the output state is that `dp` now reflects the updated `new_dp` values, and `i` is still `m + 1`.
