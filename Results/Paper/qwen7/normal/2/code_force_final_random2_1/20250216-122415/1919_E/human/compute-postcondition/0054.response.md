Output State: **`new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`, `i` is `m + 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates `new_dp[j + 1]` by adding `dp[j]` to its current value and taking the result modulo `MOD`. The value of `i` remains unchanged and is still `m + 1`. The initial conditions for `new_dp[j]` and the logic for updating `new_dp[j - 1]` if \(j - 1 \geq 0\) are not affected by this line of code.
