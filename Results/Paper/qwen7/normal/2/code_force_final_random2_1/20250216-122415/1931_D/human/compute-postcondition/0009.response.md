Output State: **`a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i, `num` is the first element of `a`, `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.**

Explanation: The code `mod_y = num % y` calculates the remainder when the value of `num` (which is the first element of the list `a`) is divided by `y`. This value is stored in the variable `mod_y`. The other variables (`a` and `num`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
