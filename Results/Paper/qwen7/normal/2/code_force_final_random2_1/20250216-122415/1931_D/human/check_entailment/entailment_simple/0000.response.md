Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires counting the number of "beautiful" pairs in an array based on specific conditions involving the sum and difference of the elements modulo given integers \(x\) and \(y\).
2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `t` (number of test cases) and `test_cases` (a list of dictionaries, each containing parameters and an array for a test case).
   - For each test case, the function processes the array to find beautiful pairs.
   - The logic to determine if a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is beautiful involves checking if both \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).
   - The approach uses frequency counting to efficiently find pairs that satisfy the conditions.
3. **Key Points**:
   - The function correctly initializes variables and processes each test case independently.
   - It calculates the necessary modular values and updates a frequency dictionary to count pairs.
   - The final result is collected in the `results` list and returned.
4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The function handles multiple test cases as expected.
   - It ensures that the sum of \(n\) over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), which is within the constraints.
   - The logic correctly identifies and counts the beautiful pairs based on the given conditions.

Given the analysis, the function appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
