Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of triples (n, x, y, a) where n is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, x and y are positive integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and a is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of `case['params']`, `x` is the second element of `case['params']`, `y` is the third element of `case['params']`, `case` is now the second element in `test_cases`, `a` is the array from the second element in `test_cases`, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for num in a:
    mod_x = num % x
    mod_y = num % y
    required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
    required_mod_y = mod_y
    print(
        f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
        )
    if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
        beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
    if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
        freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0
    freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i, `num` is the first element of `a`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, and the tuple (mod_x, mod_y) is present in the set `freq` with a value of 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i, `num` is the second element of `a`, `mod_x` is equal to `num % x`, `required_mod_x` is equal to `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, the tuple (`mod_x`, `num % y`) is present in the set `freq`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, and the tuple (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) is in `freq` if and only if `beautiful_count` is increased by 1 if and only if the tuple (`mod_x`, `num % y`) is not in `freq`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, and `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`; `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
