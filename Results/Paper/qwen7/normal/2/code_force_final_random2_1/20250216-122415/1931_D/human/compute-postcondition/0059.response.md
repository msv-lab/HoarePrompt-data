Based on the initial state provided:

- `beautiful_count` is 0.
- `a` is set to the array from `case['array']`.
- `n`, `x`, and `y` are unchanged, but their values are not specified in the initial state.
- `freq` is an empty dictionary.
- `case` is the next element in `test_cases`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
```

Here, the placeholders `{n}`, `{x}`, `{y}`, and `{a}` will be replaced with the actual values of these variables. Since the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are not explicitly given, they will be left as is in the output. The value of `a` will be the array from `case['array']`.

Output: **Processing Test Case: n = [unchanged value of n], x = [unchanged value of x], y = [unchanged value of y], array = [array from case['array']]**
