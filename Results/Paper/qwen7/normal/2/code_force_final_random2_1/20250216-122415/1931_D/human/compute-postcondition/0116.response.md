Output State: **`mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`, `a` must have at least one element, `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`, `required_mod_x` is (x - mod_x) % x.**

The code calculates `required_mod_x` as `(x - mod_x) % x`. This does not affect the values of `mod_y`, `a`, or `mod_x`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions. The new variable `required_mod_x` is introduced with the calculated value based on the given formula.
