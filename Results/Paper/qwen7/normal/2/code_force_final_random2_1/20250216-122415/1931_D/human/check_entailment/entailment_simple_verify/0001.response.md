### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly takes two arguments: `t` (number of test cases) and `test_cases` (a list of dictionaries containing the parameters for each test case).
   - It initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.

2. **Loop Through Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it correctly extracts the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `a`.
   - It prints the details of the current test case for debugging purposes.

3. **Frequency Dictionary Initialization**:
   - A dictionary `freq` is initialized to keep track of the frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs.
   - A variable `beautiful_count` is initialized to zero to count the number of beautiful pairs.

4. **Iterate Over Array Elements**:
   - For each element `num` in the array `a`, it correctly calculates `mod_x` and `mod_y` using modulo operations with `x` and `y` respectively.
   - It computes the required `mod_x` and `mod_y` values that would make the pair beautiful.
   - If the required `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair exists in the `freq` dictionary, it correctly adds the corresponding frequency to `beautiful_count`.
   - It updates the frequency of the current `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair in the `freq` dictionary.

5. **Store Result**:
   - After processing all elements in the array for the current test case, it correctly appends `beautiful_count` to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it returns the `results` list.

### Verification Against Problem Description

- **Modulo Calculations**: The program correctly calculates the modulo values and checks if the required conditions for a beautiful pair are met.
- **Frequency Counting**: The program uses a frequency dictionary to efficiently count the number of pairs that satisfy the conditions.
- **Output**: The program outputs the correct number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's walk through another example to ensure the program works as expected.

#### Example 2:
- Input: `t = 1`, `n = 7`, `x = 9`, `y = 5`, `a = [1, 10, 15, 3, 8, 12, 15]`
- Output: `0`

- Processing:
  - For `num = 1`: 
    - `mod_x = 1`, `mod_y = 1`
    - Required `mod_x = 8`, `mod_y = 1` (not found in `freq`)
  - For `num = 10`: 
    - `mod_x = 1`, `mod_y = 0`
    - Required `mod_x = 8`, `mod_y = 0` (not found in `freq`)
  - For `num = 15`: 
    - `mod_x = 6`, `mod_y = 0`
    - Required `mod_x = 3`, `mod_y = 0` (not found in `freq`)
  - For `num = 3`: 
    - `mod_x = 3`, `mod_y = 3`
    - Required `mod_x = 6`, `mod_y = 3` (not found in `freq`)
  - For `num = 8`: 
    - `mod_x = 8`, `mod_y = 3`
    - Required `mod_x = 1`, `mod_y = 3` (not found in `freq`)
  - For `num = 12`: 
    - `mod_x = 3`, `mod_y = 2`
    - Required `mod_x = 6`, `mod_y = 2` (not found in `freq`)
  - For `num = 15`: 
    - `mod_x = 6`, `mod_y = 0`
    - Required `mod_x = 3`, `mod_y = 0` (not found in `freq`)

- Final `beautiful_count = 0`

### Conclusion

After re-verifying the logic and the example walkthrough, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description. The original assessment accurately describes the program's behavior and reasoning.
