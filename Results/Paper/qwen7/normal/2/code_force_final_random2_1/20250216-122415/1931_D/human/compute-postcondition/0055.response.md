Output State: **`n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the values from `case['params']`; `results` is a list containing the final value of `beautiful_count`; `a` is a list of `n` positive integers; `beautiful_count` reflects the total count of pairs \((required\_mod\_x, required\_mod\_y)\) found in the frequency dictionary `freq` during the loop's execution; `mod_x` and `mod_y` are the remainders when the last `num` in `a` is divided by `x` and `y` respectively; `required_mod_x` is \((x - mod_x) \% x\); `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`; `freq` is updated to count the occurrences of each \((mod_x, mod_y)\) pair encountered during the loop's execution; `case` is the next element in `test_cases`.**

This output state describes the changes made by the code snippet. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are now assigned from `case['params']`, while the other variables remain in their respective states as described.
