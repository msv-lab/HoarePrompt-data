Output State: **`beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, and `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`; `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` by 1. The values of `beautiful_count`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. The only change is that `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is now one more than its previous value.
