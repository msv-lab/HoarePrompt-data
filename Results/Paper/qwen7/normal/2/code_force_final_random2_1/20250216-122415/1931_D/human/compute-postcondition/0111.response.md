Output State: **`beautiful_count` is 0, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the values from `case['params']`, and `results` is a list containing `beautiful_count`, `test_cases` must contain at least one more element.**

Explanation: The line `beautiful_count = 0` sets the value of `beautiful_count` to 0. All other variables retain their previous states, meaning `freq` remains an empty dictionary, `n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the values from `case['params']`, and `results` is a list containing `beautiful_count` with the condition that `test_cases` must contain at least one more element.
