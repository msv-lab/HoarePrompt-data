Output State: **`a` must have at least one element; `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.**

Explanation: The code `mod_x = num % x` calculates the modulus (remainder) of `num` divided by `x` and assigns it to `mod_x`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `num` and `x`, `mod_x` will be the remainder of their division. The precondition that `a` must have at least one element remains unchanged.
