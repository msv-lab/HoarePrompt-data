Output State: **`a` is a non-empty array (at least one element); `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`.**

Explanation: The code `mod_x = num % x` calculates the modulus (remainder) of `num` divided by `x` and assigns it to the variable `mod_x`. Since the initial values of `num` and `x` are not specified, `mod_x` will hold the remainder of their division. The array `a` remains unchanged.
