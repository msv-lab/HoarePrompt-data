Output State: **`mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`**

Explanation: The code assigns the remainder of `num` divided by `y` to `mod_y`. The values of `mod_x` and `x` remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, `mod_x` is still the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`, and `mod_y` is now the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
