Output State: **`beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`**.

Explanation: The line of code `beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_y]` increments the value of `beautiful_count` by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. The other variables (`mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
