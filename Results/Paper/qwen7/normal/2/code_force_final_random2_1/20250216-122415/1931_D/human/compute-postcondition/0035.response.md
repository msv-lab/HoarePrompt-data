Output State: **`a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i, `num` is the second element of `a`, `mod_x` is equal to `num % x`, `required_mod_x` is equal to `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, the tuple (`mod_x`, `num % y`) is present in the set `freq`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, and the tuple (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) is in `freq` if and only if `beautiful_count` is increased by 1 if and only if the tuple (`mod_x`, `num % y`) is not in `freq`**.

Explanation: The code increments the count of the tuple (`mod_x`, `num % y`) in the set `freq`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
