Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is a non-empty array (at least one element).
- `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`.
- `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(
    f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
)
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`.
- `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`.

However, the values of `num`, `mod_x`, and `required_mod_x` are not explicitly provided. Therefore, we cannot determine their exact values. We can only describe `mod_y` and `required_mod_y` based on the given information.

Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [mod_y]** (where `[num]`, `[mod_x]`, and `[required_mod_x]` are unknown values, and `[mod_y]` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`.)
