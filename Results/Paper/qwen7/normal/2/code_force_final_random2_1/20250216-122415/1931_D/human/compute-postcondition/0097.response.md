Output State: **`beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]`, `mod_y` is equal to `num % y`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, `mod_x` is updated to `num % x`, and the frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` in `freq` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments `beautiful_count` by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. Since `required_mod_x` is equal to `mod_x` and `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[mod_x, mod_y]`. The values of `mod_y`, `required_mod_y`, `mod_x`, and the frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` in `freq` remain unchanged from their initial states.
