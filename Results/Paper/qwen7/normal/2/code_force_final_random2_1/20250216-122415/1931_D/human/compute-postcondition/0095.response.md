Output State: **`a` is a non-empty array with at least one less element (excluding the first element), `mod_y` is equal to `num % y`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, `mod_x` is updated to `num % x`, and the frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` in `freq` is incremented by 1; `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`**.

Explanation: The code simply reassigns `required_mod_y` to the current value of `mod_y`. Since `mod_y` was already equal to `num % y`, and no other variables are affected, the values of `mod_x`, `required_mod_x`, `a`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_y`, and the frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` in `freq` remain unchanged.
