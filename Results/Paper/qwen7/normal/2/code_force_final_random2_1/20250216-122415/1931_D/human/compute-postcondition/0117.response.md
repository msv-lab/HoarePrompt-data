Output State: **`mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`, `a` must have at least one element, `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`, `required_mod_x` is (x - mod_x) % x, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`**.

Explanation: The line `required_mod_y = mod_y` simply assigns the value of `mod_y` to `required_mod_y`. No other changes occur to the other variables.
