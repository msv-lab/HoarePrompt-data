Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `num` and `a`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element `num` in the array `a`.

3. **Determine the state changes**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `a` is a non-empty array with at least one element.
   - `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`.
   - `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`.
   - The frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` in `freq` is increased by 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `a` is a non-empty array, the next `num` will be the next element in the array `a`.
   - `mod_y` will be recalculated as the remainder of the new `num` divided by `y`.
   - `required_mod_y` will still be equal to the new `mod_y`.
   - The frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` in `freq` will be increased by 1 again.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `a` will now be the array without the first element (since `num` was the first element processed).
   - `mod_y` will be the remainder of the new `num` divided by `y`.
   - `required_mod_y` will remain the same as it was updated in the previous iteration.
   - The frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` in `freq` will be increased by 1.

Given this reasoning, the new state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: `a` is a non-empty array with at least one element (excluding the first element), `mod_y` is the remainder of the new `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, and the frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` in `freq` is increased by 1.**
