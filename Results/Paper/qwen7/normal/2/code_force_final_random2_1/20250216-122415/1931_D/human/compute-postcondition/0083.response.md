Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is a non-empty array with at least one element (excluding the first element).
   - `mod_y` is equal to `required_mod_y`.
   - `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`.
   - `required_mod_x` is equal to `(x - mod_x) % x`.
   - The frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` in `freq` is increased by 1.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(
       f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
       )
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `mod_y` is equal to `required_mod_y`, and `required_mod_y` is also equal to `mod_y`. Therefore, `mod_y` and `required_mod_y` have the same value.
- `required_mod_x` is defined as `(x - mod_x) % x`.

However, the values of `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` are not explicitly given in the initial state. We need to infer their values from the context provided.

Given that `mod_y` and `required_mod_y` are the same, let's denote this common value as `value`. Similarly, `required_mod_x` is defined but its specific value depends on `x` and `mod_x`.

Since the exact values of `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` are not specified, we can only express them in terms of the given information.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [value], required_mod_x: [(x - [mod_x]) % x], required_mod_y: [value]** (where `[num]`, `[mod_x]`, and `[value]` are placeholders for the actual values of `num`, `mod_x`, and `mod_y` respectively, and `x` is the unknown value used in the calculation of `required_mod_x`).
