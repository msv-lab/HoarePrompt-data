Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given code is `num`, which is taken from the array `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states hold:
   - `a` is a non-empty array with at least one element.
   - `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`.
   - `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`.
   - The frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` in `freq` is increased by 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element `num` in the array `a`. For the loop to continue executing, there must be at least one element left in the array `a`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `num` is taken from `a`, the value of `num` will change in each iteration.
   - `mod_y` will be recalculated as the remainder of the new `num` when divided by `y`.
   - `required_mod_y` will remain the same as it was set initially and does not change within the loop.
   - The frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` in `freq` will be updated based on the new `mod_y` value.

5. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - `a` must have at least one element remaining.
   - `num` will be the next element from `a`.
   - `mod_y` will be the remainder of this new `num` when divided by `y`.
   - `required_mod_y` remains unchanged.
   - The frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` in `freq` will be updated.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `a` must have at least one element remaining.
- `num` will be the next element from `a`.
- `mod_y` will be the remainder of this new `num` when divided by `y`.
- `required_mod_y` remains unchanged.
- The frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` in `freq` will be updated.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `a` is a non-empty array with at least one element, `num` is the next element from `a`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, and the frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` in `freq` is increased by 1.**
