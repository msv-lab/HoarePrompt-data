Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\).
   - `num` is the second element of `a`.
   - `mod_x` is equal to `num % x`.
   - `required_mod_x` is equal to \((x - mod_x) \% x\).
   - `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`.
   - The tuple (`mod_x`, `num % y`) is present in the set `freq`.
   - `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1.
   - The tuple (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) is in `freq` if and only if `beautiful_count` is increased by 1 if and only if the tuple (`mod_x`, `num % y`) is not in `freq`.

2. **Loop Head**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `num` in the list `a`.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each element `num` in the list `a`, at the start of each iteration, `num` will be the next element in the list `a`.
   - `mod_x` will be updated to `num % x`.
   - `required_mod_x` will be updated to \((x - mod_x) \% x\).
   - `required_mod_y` remains the same as it is not dependent on `num`.
   - The tuple (`mod_x`, `num % y`) will be checked for presence in the set `freq`.
   - `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` will be incremented by 1.
   - The tuple (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) will be checked for presence in `freq` to determine if `beautiful_count` should be increased.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- `a` will lose its first element (since `num` was the second element, now it will be the third element in the next iteration).
- `num` will be the new element from the list `a`.
- `mod_x` will be updated to `num % x`.
- `required_mod_x` will be updated to \((x - mod_x) \% x\).
- `required_mod_y` remains unchanged.
- The tuple (`mod_x`, `num % y`) will be checked for presence in the set `freq`.
- `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` will be incremented by 1.
- The tuple (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) will be checked for presence in `freq` to determine if `beautiful_count` should be increased.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**State: `a` is a list of n-1 positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i, `num` is the third element of `a`, `mod_x` is equal to `num % x`, `required_mod_x` is equal to \((x - mod_x) \% x\), `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, the tuple (`mod_x`, `num % y`) is present in the set `freq`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, and the tuple (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) is in `freq` if and only if `beautiful_count` is increased by 1 if and only if the tuple (`mod_x`, `num % y`) is not in `freq`**.
