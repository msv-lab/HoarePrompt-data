Based on the initial state provided:

- `beautiful_count` is 0.
- `freq` is an empty dictionary.
- `n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the values from `case['params']`.
- `results` is a list containing `beautiful_count`, and `test_cases` must contain at least one more element.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')
```

Here, `n`, `x`, and `y` are placeholders for the values taken from `case['params']`, but their specific values are not explicitly given. Similarly, `array` (which should be `a` in this context) is also a placeholder for an array, but its specific values are not provided.

Given these details, the output will include the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a` from `case['params']`.

Output: **Processing Test Case: n = [value of n], x = [value of x], y = [value of y], array = [value of a]**
