Output State: **`a` is a non-empty array with at least one element, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, and the frequency of (mod_x, mod_y) in `freq` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the frequency of the tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` in the dictionary `freq` by 1. Since `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, and `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, these values remain unchanged. The array `a` and the dictionary `freq` are the only structures affected, with `freq` now having one more occurrence of the tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)`.
