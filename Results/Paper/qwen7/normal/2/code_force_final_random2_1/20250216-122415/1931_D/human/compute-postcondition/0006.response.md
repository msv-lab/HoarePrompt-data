Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `test_cases` is a list of triples \((n, x, y, a)\), where:
  - \(n\) is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\),
  - \(x\) and \(y\) are positive integers such that \(1 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\),
  - \(a\) is a list of \(n\) positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\).
- `results` is an empty list.
- `n` is the first element of `case['params']`.
- `x` is the second element of `case['params']`.
- `y` is the third element of `case['params']`.
- `case` is now the second element in `test_cases`.
- `a` is the array from the second element in `test_cases`.
- `freq` is an empty dictionary.
- `beautiful_count` is 0.

When the print statement `print(f'Processing Test Case: n = {n}, x = {x}, y = {y}, array = {a}')` is executed, it will print the details of the second test case from the `test_cases` list.

Given the structure of the `test_cases` list, the second element in `test_cases` will be a tuple \((n, x, y, a)\). Therefore, `n`, `x`, and `y` will be the first, second, and third elements of this tuple, respectively, and `a` will be the fourth element of the tuple.

Output: **Processing Test Case: n = [n], x = [x], y = [y], array = [a]** (where \([n]\), \([x]\), \([y]\), and \([a]\) are the values of \(n\), \(x\), \(y\), and the array \(a\) from the second element in `test_cases`)
