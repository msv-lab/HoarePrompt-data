Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `a` is an empty array, indicating that all elements have been processed. `beautiful_count` contains the total count of numbers that meet the specified conditions across all iterations. For each `num` in `a`, the frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs has been updated in `freq`. Specifically, `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` will hold the count of numbers that have `mod_x` and `mod_y` as their respective remainders when divided by `x` and `y`. The final value of `beautiful_count` is the sum of `freq[(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)]` for all unique `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs encountered during the iterations.
