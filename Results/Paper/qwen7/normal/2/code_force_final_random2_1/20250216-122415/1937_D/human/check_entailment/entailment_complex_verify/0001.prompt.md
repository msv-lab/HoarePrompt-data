You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

    #State: Output State: `totalOne` is equal to 0, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers where each integer `i + 1` is added to the list if the character at index `i` in `s1` is '>', `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting from 0 without any elements (since `totalOne` is 0), `suffZero` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all indices `i + 1` for each character '<' in `s1` from the end to the beginning, `ans` is a list of zeros of length `n`, and `i` is -1 (indicating the loop has completed all its iterations).
    #
    #This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `totalOne` will be 0 because it is decremented in each iteration until it reaches 0. The `pre` list will be modified according to the characters in `s1`, and `preOne` will be a list of cumulative sums of `pre` but will be empty since `totalOne` is 0. The `suffZero` list will contain the cumulative sum of all indices `i + 1` for each character '<' in `s1` from the end to the beginning, and `ans` will be a list of zeros of length `n` because no value is assigned to any index in `ans` during the loop's execution. The variable `i` will be -1, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: 0 0 0 ... 0 (n times)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s1` consisting of characters '<' and '>' and an integer `n` representing the length of `s1`. It calculates and prints a list `ans` of length `n`, where each element is determined based on the positions of '>' and '<' in `s1`. Specifically, for each position `i` in `s1`, the value in `ans[i]` is computed using the counts of '>' and '<' characters to the left and right of position `i`. If the count of '>' characters to the left is less than or equal to the count of '<' characters to the right, or vice versa, the value in `ans[i]` is calculated accordingly. If neither condition is met, a more complex calculation involving cumulative sums is performed. After processing all positions in `s1`, the function prints a list of zeros of length `n`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We have a one-dimensional grid of length \( n \).
   - Each cell contains either `<` or `>` indicating the direction the pinball should move.
   - The pinball starts at a specific cell and moves according to the direction indicated by the cell, then the direction is reversed.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid.

2. **Given Code**:
   - The code includes two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` seems to be calculating some difference based on an array and a time value.
   - `func_2` is the main function that processes the input string and calculates the time for each pinball starting position.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is used to calculate a difference between elements in an array.
   - It uses `max(-n, -1 - times)` which seems to handle boundary conditions.
   - The function returns `arr[-1] - arr[max(-n, -1 - times)]`.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Initializes arrays `pre` and `suffZero` to store positions where the direction changes.
   - Uses `accumulate` to create `preOne` which stores cumulative sums of positions.
   - Iterates backward through the string to calculate the time for each starting position.
   - Uses conditional logic to update the answer array `ans` based on whether the current cell is `>` or `<`.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `pre` and `suffZero` are correctly initialized to store positions where the direction changes.
   - `preOne` is correctly accumulated to store cumulative sums of positions.

2. **Backward Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates backward through the string, updating the answer array `ans` based on the direction of the current cell.
   - The logic inside the loop correctly handles both cases (`>` and `<`) and updates the answer array accordingly.

3. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - The use of `func_1` to handle boundary conditions seems appropriate and correctly implemented.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the answer array `ans`, which contains the time for each starting position.

### Conclusion:

After reviewing the code, the implementation appears to correctly follow the problem description and logic. The function `func_2` correctly calculates the time for each starting position of the pinball based on the given grid configuration.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
