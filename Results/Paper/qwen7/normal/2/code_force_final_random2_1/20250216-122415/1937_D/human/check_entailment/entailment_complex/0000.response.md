Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function is supposed to calculate the difference between the last element of the list `arr` and the element `times` positions before the last element (if within bounds). However, the function always returns 0, regardless of the values in `arr` and `times`. This is incorrect because it does not perform the intended calculation. The function should return `arr[-1] - arr[max(-n, -1 - times)]` to correctly compute the difference.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function is responsible for calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each query. The logic in `func_2` seems to be designed to handle the movement of the pinball based on the direction of the characters in the string `s1`. However, the function incorrectly initializes `preOne` as an empty list and does not use the results of `func_1` correctly. Additionally, the function prints a list of zeros instead of the expected times for the pinball to leave the grid.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1` is incorrect, and the function `func_2` does not produce the expected output.

Correctness: **False**
