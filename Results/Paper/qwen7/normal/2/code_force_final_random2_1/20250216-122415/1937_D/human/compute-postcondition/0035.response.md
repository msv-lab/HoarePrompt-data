Postcondition: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers where each integer i + 1 is added to the list if the character at index i in `s1` is '>', `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting from 0, `suffZero` is a list containing 0 and 1, `ans` is a list of zeros of length n, `i` is `n-3`, `el` is the character at index `n-1` in `s1` and is not '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`. If `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`, where `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]` and `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, zr)`. If `zr` is greater than `ol`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`, where `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)` and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`.**
