Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers where each integer i + 1 is added to the list if the character at index i in `s1` is '>', `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting from 0, `suffZero` is a list containing 0, `ans` is a list of zeros of length n, `i` is n-2, `el` is the character at index n-1 in `s1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is 2 * `func_1(suffZero, ol)`, `oneInd` is 2 * `preOne[-1]` - `func_1(preOne, 1)`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `ans[i]` to `zeroInd - oneInd`.
- `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`.
- `oneInd` is calculated as `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
