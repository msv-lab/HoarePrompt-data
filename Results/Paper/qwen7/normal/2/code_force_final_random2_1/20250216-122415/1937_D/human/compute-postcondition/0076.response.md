Output State: **`ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `totalOne` to `ol` and the value of `len(suffZero) - 1` to `zr`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged. The initial conditions for `totalOne`, `suffZero`, and the relationship between `ol` and `zr` are preserved.
