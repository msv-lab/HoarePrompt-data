Output State: **`ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `zeroInd - oneInd` to `ans[i]`. Since the values of `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are defined in terms of other variables and functions, these definitions remain unchanged. The other variables (`ol`, `zr`) also remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new assignment to `ans[i]`.
