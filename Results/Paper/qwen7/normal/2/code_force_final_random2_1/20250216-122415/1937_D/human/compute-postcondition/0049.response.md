Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre` minus 1, `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers where each integer i + 1 is added to the list if the character at index i in `s1` is '>', `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting from 0 without the last element, `suffZero` is a list containing 0, `ans` is a list of zeros of length n, `i` is `n-4`, `el` is the character at index `n-1` in `s1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`. `preOne` is missing its last element.**

Explanation:
- The code `preOne.pop()` removes the last element from the list `preOne`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
- The value of `i` is decremented by 1 because `i` was `n-3` and now it is `n-4`.
- The value of `ol` (which is `totalOne`) and `zr` (which is `len(suffZero) - 1`) remain the same since they are not affected by the operation.
- The values of `s1`, `pre`, `suffZero`, `ans`, `el`, and `fi` remain unchanged.
