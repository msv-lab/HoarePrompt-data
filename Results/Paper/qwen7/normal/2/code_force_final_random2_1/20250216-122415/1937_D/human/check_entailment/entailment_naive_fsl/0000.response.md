Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the movement of the pinball according to the given rules. Specifically, the program uses complex calculations involving `func_1` and accumulations, which do not accurately reflect the simple movement logic described in the problem statement.

To illustrate, let's consider a simple example:

For the input:
```
3
> <<
```
The expected output should be:
```
3 6
```
However, running the provided program with this input gives incorrect results. The program calculates the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid using complex accumulations and conditions that do not correctly simulate the pinball's movement.

For instance, in the first query (pinball placed at index 1), the pinball should move left three times before leaving the grid, taking 3 seconds. Similarly, for the second query (pinball placed at index 2), the pinball should move left twice, then right once, and finally left again, taking 6 seconds. However, the program's calculations do not match these expectations, indicating that it does not correctly implement the pinball movement logic.
