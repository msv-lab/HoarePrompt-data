Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre` minus 1, `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers where each integer i + 1 is added to the list if the character at index i in `s1` is '>', `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting from 0 without the last element, `suffZero` is a list containing 0, `ans` is a list of zeros of length n, `i` is `n-3`, `el` is the character at index `n-1` in `s1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is 2 * `func_1(suffZero, ol)`, `oneInd` is 2 * `preOne[-1]` - `func_1(preOne, 1)`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `oneInd` as `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`. Since the exact values of `preOne` and `func_1` are not provided, we cannot simplify further. However, the other variables remain unchanged.
