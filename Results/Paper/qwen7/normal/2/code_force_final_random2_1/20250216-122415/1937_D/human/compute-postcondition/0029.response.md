Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers where each integer i + 1 is added to the list if the character at index i in `s1` is '>', `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting from 0, `suffZero` is a list containing 0 and 1, `ans` is a list of zeros of length n, `i` is n-3, `el` is the character at index n-1 in `s1` and is not '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`, `oneInd` is 2 * `func_1(preOne, zr)`, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans[i]` is updated to `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
