Postcondition: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre` minus 1, `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers where each integer i + 1 is added to the list if the character at index i in `s1` is '>', `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting from 0 without the last element, `suffZero` is a list containing 0, `ans` is a list of zeros of length n, `i` is `n-3`, `el` is the character at index `n-1` in `s1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`.

If `totalOne` (ol) is less than or equal to `len(suffZero) - 1` (zr), then:
- `zeroInd` is 2 times the result of `func_1(suffZero, ol)`.
- `oneInd` is 2 times the last element of `preOne` minus the result of `func_1(preOne, 1)`.
- `ans[i]` is the difference between `zeroInd` and `oneInd`.

Otherwise:
- `zeroInd` is 0.
- `oneInd` is the sum of `func_1(preOne, zr + 1)` minus `func_1(preOne, zr)`.
- `ans[i]` is the difference between `zeroInd` and `oneInd` plus `n + 1 - fi`.**
