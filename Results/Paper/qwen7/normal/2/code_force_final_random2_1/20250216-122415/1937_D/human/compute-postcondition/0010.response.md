Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers where each integer i + 1 is added to the list if the character at index i in `s1` is '>', `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting from 0, `suffZero` is a list containing 0, `ans` is a list of zeros of length n, `i` is n-2, `el` is the character at index n-1 in `s1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is 2 * `func_1(suffZero, ol)`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)` to the variable `zeroInd`. Since the exact value of `func_1(suffZero, ol)` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `zeroInd`. However, we know that `suffZero` is a list containing only one element, which is 0, and `ol` is equal to `totalOne`. Therefore, `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * func_1([0], totalOne)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
