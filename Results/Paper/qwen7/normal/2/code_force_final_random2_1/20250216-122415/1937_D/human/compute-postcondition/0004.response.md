Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers where each integer i + 1 is added to the list if the character at index i in `s1` is '>', `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting from 0, `suffZero` is a list containing 0, `ans` is a list of zeros of length n.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `ans` with `n` zeros. This means that every element in `ans` is set to 0. The other variables (`totalOne`, `s1`, `pre`, `preOne`, `suffZero`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
