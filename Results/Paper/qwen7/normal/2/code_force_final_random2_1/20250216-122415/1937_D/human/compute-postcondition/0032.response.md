Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers where each integer i + 1 is added to the list if the character at index i in `s1` is '>', `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting from 0, `suffZero` is a list containing 0 and 1, `ans` is a list of zeros of length n, `i` is `n-3`, `el` is the character at index `n-1` in `s1` and is not '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zr` is greater than `ol`, `zeroInd` is calculated as 2 * `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)` - `func_1(suffZero, 1)`**

Explanation: The code calculates `zeroInd` using the function `func_1`. However, the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `zeroInd`. But we know that `zeroInd` is calculated based on the values of `suffZero`, `ol + 1`, and `1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
