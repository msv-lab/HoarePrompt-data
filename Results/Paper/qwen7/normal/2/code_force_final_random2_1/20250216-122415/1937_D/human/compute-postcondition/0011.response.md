Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers where each integer i + 1 is added to the list if the character at index i in `s1` is '>', `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting from 0, `suffZero` is a list containing 0, `ans` is a list of zeros of length n, `i` is n-2, `el` is the character at index n-1 in `s1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `zeroInd` is 2 * `func_1(suffZero, ol)`, `oneInd` is 2 * `preOne[-1]` - `func_1(preOne, 1)`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `oneInd` based on the values of `preOne` and the function `func_1`. The value of `preOne[-1]` is the last element in the list `preOne`, which is the cumulative sum up to the last element of `pre`. The function `func_1` is applied to two arguments: the list `preOne` and the integer 1. The exact value of `oneInd` depends on these values, but since the specific implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we express it in terms of these values. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
