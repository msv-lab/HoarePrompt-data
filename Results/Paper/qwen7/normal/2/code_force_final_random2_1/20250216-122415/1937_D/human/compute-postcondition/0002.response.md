Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers where each integer i + 1 is added to the list if the character at index i in `s1` is '>', `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting from 0.**

Explanation: 
- `totalOne` remains unchanged as it is equal to the length of `pre`.
- `s1` and `pre` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code.
- `preOne` is created using `list(accumulate(pre, initial=0))`, which generates a new list where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `pre`, starting with 0. This means `preOne[0]` is 0, and each subsequent element in `preOne` is the cumulative sum up to that point in `pre`.
