Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre` minus 1, `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers where each integer i + 1 is added to the list if the character at index i in `s1` is '>', `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting from 0 without the last element, `suffZero` is a list containing 0 and appended with `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`, `ans` is a list of zeros of length n, `i` is `n-3`, `el` is the character at index `n-1` in `s1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `el` is the character at index `n-1` in `s1`.**

Explanation: The code appends `suffZero[-1] + i + 1` to the list `suffZero`. Given that `i` is `n-3`, the new value appended to `suffZero` is `suffZero[-1] + (n-3) + 1`, which simplifies to `suffZero[-1] + n - 2`. This updated value is now the last element in `suffZero`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
