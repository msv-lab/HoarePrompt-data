Based on the initial state provided:

- `totalOne` is equal to 0.
- `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `pre` is a list of integers where each integer `i + 1` is added to the list if the character at index `i` in `s1` is '>'.
- `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting from 0 without any elements (since `totalOne` is 0).
- `suffZero` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all indices `i + 1` for each character '<' in `s1` from the end to the beginning.
- `ans` is a list of zeros of length `n`, and no value is assigned to any index in `ans` during the loop's execution.
- `i` is -1, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.

The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the `ans` list, which is a list of zeros of length `n`.

Output: **0 0 0 ... 0 (n times)**
