Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers where each integer i + 1 is added to the list if the character at index i in `s1` is '>', `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting from 0, `suffZero` is a list containing 0, `ans` is a list of zeros of length n, `i` is `n-2`, `el` is the character at index `n-1` in `s1`, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `oneInd` is the sum of `func_1(preOne, zr)` and `func_1(preOne, zr + 1)` minus `func_1(preOne, 1)`, `ol` is greater than `zr`, `zeroInd` is 0, `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`**

Explanation: The code calculates the difference between two function calls `func_1(preOne, zr + 1)` and `func_1(preOne, zr)`, and assigns the result to the variable `fi`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
