The variables in the loop head are `i` and `w`, so we can only adjust these two variables.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `w`. If `i` is less than `w`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `w` must be greater than 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `w`. Since `i` is currently 2, `w` must be greater than 2.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `w` is greater than 2.

State: **`i` is 2, `q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 ≤ q < n ≤ 10^9), `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 ≤ x < n), and `w` must be greater than 2**
