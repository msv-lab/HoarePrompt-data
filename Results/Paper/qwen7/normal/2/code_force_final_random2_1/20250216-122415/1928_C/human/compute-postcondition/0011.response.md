Output State: **`i` is 1, `q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 ≤ q < n ≤ 10^9), `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 ≤ x < n), `w` must be greater than 1, and `q` is divisible by `i`; `M` is a list containing the value `i`.**

Explanation: The code `M += [i]` appends the value of `i` to the list `M`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `M` becomes a list containing the value 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
