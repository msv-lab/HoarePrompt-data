Output State: **`i` is 1, `q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 ≤ q < n ≤ 10^9), `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 ≤ x < n), `w` must be greater than 1, and `q` is divisible by `i`; `M` is a list containing the values `i` and `q // i`.**

Explanation: The code `M += [q // i]` appends the value of `q // i` to the list `M`. Given that `i` is 1, `q // i` simplifies to `q` because dividing `q` by 1 results in `q` itself. Therefore, the list `M` now contains both the original value of `i` (which is 1) and the new value `q`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
