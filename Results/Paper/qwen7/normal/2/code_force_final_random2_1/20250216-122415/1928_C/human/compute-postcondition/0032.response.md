The loop condition is `i < w`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` must be less than `w`.

Given the current state:
- `i` is 3
- `q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 ≤ q < n ≤ 10^9)
- `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 ≤ x < n)
- `w` must be greater than 2
- `M` is a list containing the value 2

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be less than `w`. Since `i` is currently 3, `w` must be greater than 3.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `w` must be greater than 3.

State: **`i` is 3, `q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 ≤ q < n ≤ 10^9), `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 ≤ x < n), `w` must be greater than 3, and `M` is a list containing the value 2**
