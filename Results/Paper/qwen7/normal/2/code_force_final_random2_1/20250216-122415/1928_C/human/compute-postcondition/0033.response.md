Output State: **`i` is 3, `q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 ≤ q < n ≤ 10^9), `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 ≤ x < n), `w` must be greater than 3, `M` is a list containing the values 2 and 3**.

Explanation: The code `M += [i]` appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `M`. Initially, `M` contains the value 2. After executing the code, `M` will contain both 2 and 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
