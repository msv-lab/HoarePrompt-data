Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the number of possible values for \( k \) given \( n \) and \( x \). The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and we need to find all \( k \) such that the given position \( n \) and number \( x \) fit within the settling pattern.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The position \( n \) and the number \( x \) must satisfy certain conditions derived from the settling pattern.
   - The function `func_1` is designed to find all divisors of \( q \) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates all divisors of \( q \) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).
   - The logic inside the function is sound and correctly implements the required functionality.

4. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program correctly processes each test case by calculating \( y = n + x \) and checking if \( y \) is even.
   - If \( y \) is even, it calls `func_1` with appropriate arguments and handles the results.
   - The logic for handling the results is also correct.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles edge cases where \( y \) is odd by printing 0.
   - The program correctly handles the calculation of \( M \) and prints the length of the resulting set.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
