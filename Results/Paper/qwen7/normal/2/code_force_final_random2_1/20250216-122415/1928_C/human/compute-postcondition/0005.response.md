Postcondition: **`q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 ≤ q < n ≤ 10^9), and `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 ≤ x < n); `M` is a list containing `[w]`; `w` is the square root of `q` and is an integer greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. If the condition `w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1` is true, then `M` will contain `[w]`, where `w` is the integer square root of `q` and satisfies the condition `w >= x - 1`. If the condition is false, the list `M` remains unchanged as it was initially empty.
