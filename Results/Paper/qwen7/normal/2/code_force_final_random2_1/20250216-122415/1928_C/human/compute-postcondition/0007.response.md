Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < w`.

2. **Determine the current state of variables involved in the loop condition**:
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `w` is the square root of `q` and is an integer greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

3. **Check if the loop can execute the first time**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be less than `w`.
   - Currently, `i` is 1.

4. **Analyze the possible values of `w`**:
   - Since `w` is the square root of `q` and `q` is an integer such that \(1 \leq q < n \leq 10^9\), `w` is also an integer.
   - Given that `w` is an integer and \(w \geq x - 1\) where \(1 \leq x < n\), the smallest possible value for `w` would be when `x = 2`, making `w \geq 1`.

5. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - To ensure that the loop executes the first time, `w` must be greater than `i`, which is 1.
   - Therefore, `w` must be greater than 1.

6. **Consider the constraints on `q` and `x`**:
   - Since `w` is the square root of `q`, `q` must be a perfect square and `w` must be an integer.
   - The constraint \(w \geq x - 1\) ensures that `w` is at least `x - 1`.

Given these considerations, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `w` to ensure it is greater than 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 ≤ q < n ≤ 10^9), `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 ≤ x < n), and `w` must be greater than 1**.
