You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: q is an integer representing the position in the line (1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9), and x is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 ≤ x < n).
def func_1(q, x):
    M = []
    w = math.sqrt(q)
    if (w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1) :
        M += [w]
    #State: `q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 ≤ q < n ≤ 10^9), and `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 ≤ x < n); `M` is a list containing `[w]`; `w` is the square root of `q` and is an integer greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
    i = 1
    while i < w:
        if q % i == 0:
            if i >= x - 1:
                M += [i]
            if q // i >= x - 1:
                M += [q // i]
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is `w`, `q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 ≤ q < n ≤ 10^9), `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 ≤ x < n), `w` is the square root of `q` and is an integer greater than or equal to `x - 1`, and `M` is a list containing all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` until it reaches `w`. During each iteration, it checks if `q` is divisible by `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, it adds `i` to the list `M`. Similarly, if `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, it adds `q // i` to the list `M`. After executing the loop, `i` will be equal to `w`, and `M` will contain all divisors of `q` that meet the specified condition.
    return M
    #The program returns a list `M` containing all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, `q` and `x`. `q` is an integer representing the position in the line, and `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling. The function returns a list `M` containing all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `M` containing all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
