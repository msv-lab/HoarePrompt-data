Output State: **`q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9), and `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 ≤ x < n); `M` is an empty list; `w` is the square root of `q`.**

The code calculates the square root of `q` and assigns it to the variable `w`. The values of `q`, `x`, and `M` remain unchanged.
