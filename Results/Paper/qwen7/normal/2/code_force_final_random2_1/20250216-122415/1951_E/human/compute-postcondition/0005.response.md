Output State: **`ch` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters with an even length, `b` is the integer division of the length of `ch` by 2, and the length of `ch` is even, `a` is 4, and the function `func_1(ch[:b])` returns False.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value `4` to the variable `a`. The other variables (`ch`, `b`, and the function call) remain unchanged from their initial states.
