You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ch is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters and its length can be even or odd.
def func_2(ch):
    b = len(ch) // 2
    if (len(ch) % 2 == 0) :
        if func_1(ch[:b]) :
            a = 3
        else :
            a = 4
        #State: Postcondition: `ch` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters with an even length; `b` is the integer division of the length of `ch` by 2, and the length of `ch` is even; if `func_1(ch[:b])` returns True, then `a` is 3. Otherwise, `a` is 4.
    else :
        if func_1(ch[:b]) :
            a = 1
        else :
            a = 2
        #State: Postcondition: `ch` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters with an odd length; `b` is the integer division of the length of `ch` by 2; `a` is 1 if `func_1(ch[:b])` evaluates to True, otherwise `a` is 2.
    #State: Postcondition: `ch` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `b` is the integer division of the length of `ch` by 2. If the length of `ch` is even, and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns True, then `a` is 3. Otherwise, `a` is 4. If the length of `ch` is odd, then `a` is 1 if `func_1(ch[:b])` evaluates to True, otherwise `a` is 2.
    return a
    #The program returns either 1, 2, 3, or 4 based on the conditions specified for variable 'a'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a string `ch` consisting of lowercase Latin characters and returns either 1, 2, 3, or 4 based on the conditions for variable 'a'.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns either 1, 2, 3, or 4 based on the conditions specified for variable 'a'.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
