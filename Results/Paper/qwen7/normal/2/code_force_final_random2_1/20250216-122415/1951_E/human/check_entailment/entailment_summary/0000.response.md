Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires partitioning a string `s` into substrings such that none of these substrings form a palindrome. The solution involves several steps and uses helper functions `func_1` and `func_2`.

2. **Analysis of Helper Functions**:
   - `func_1` checks if the first half of a string is a reverse of the second half. This helps in identifying palindromic substrings.
   - `func_2` uses `func_1` to determine how to partition the string. It returns a value indicating the type of partition needed.

3. **Main Logic Analysis**:
   - The main logic iterates through each test case, checking if the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
   - It uses the helper functions to determine the appropriate partitioning strategy.
   - The logic correctly handles different lengths and cases of the input string.

4. **Verification of Correctness**:
   - For the string "sinktheyacht", the code correctly identifies it as a single non-palindromic substring.
   - For the string "lllllllll", the code correctly identifies that no valid partition exists.
   - For the string "uwuowouwu", the code correctly identifies a valid partition into three non-palindromic substrings.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases like strings of length 1 or 2 appropriately.
   - It also handles even and odd length strings correctly.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
