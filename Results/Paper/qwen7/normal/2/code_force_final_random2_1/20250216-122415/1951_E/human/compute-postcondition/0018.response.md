Output State: **The program returns either 1, 2, 3, or 4 based on the conditions specified for variable 'a'.**

To break it down:
- `ch` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
- `b` is the integer division of the length of `ch` by 2.
- If the length of `ch` is even, and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns True, then `a` is 3.
- If the length of `ch` is even, and `func_1(ch[:b])` returns False, then `a` is 4.
- If the length of `ch` is odd, then `a` is 1 if `func_1(ch[:b])` evaluates to True, otherwise `a` is 2.

Since `func_1(ch[:b])` is not defined in terms of its return value in the given information, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `a`. Therefore, the possible values for `a` are 1, 2, 3, or 4 based on the conditions provided.
