Postcondition: `ch` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `b` is the integer division of the length of `ch` by 2. If the length of `ch` is even, then `a` is 3 if `func_1(ch[:b])` returns True, otherwise `a` is 4. If the length of `ch` is odd, then `a` is 1 if `func_1(ch[:b])` evaluates to True, otherwise `a` is 2.
