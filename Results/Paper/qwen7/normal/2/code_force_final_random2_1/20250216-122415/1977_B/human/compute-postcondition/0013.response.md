Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is the value of `int(input())`, `x` is the value of `int(input())`, `s` is a list containing either '1' or '0' with an additional '1' appended, `length` is 30**.

Explanation: The code `s.append('1')` appends the string `'1'` to the list `s`. Since `s` initially contains either `'1'` or `'0'` and has a length of 30, after appending `'1'`, `s` now contains one more `'1'`. All other variables (`i`, `t`, `x`, and `length`) remain unchanged.
