Output State: **flag is 0, i is 29, n is 29, s[1] is '0', s[29] is '0', s[30] is '1'**

The code `s.append('1')` adds the string `'1'` to the list `s`. Initially, `s` contains two elements: `s[1]` is `'0'` and `s[29]` is `'0'`. After appending `'1'` to the list, the length of `s` increases by one, and the new element `s[30]` is `'1'`. The values of `flag`, `i`, `n`, `s[1]`, and `s[29]` remain unchanged.
