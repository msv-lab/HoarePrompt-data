Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than 30.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `i + 1` and less than 30.
   - `s` is a list containing at least one '1'.
   - If `x & pow(2, i)` is true, `s` will contain '1' appended to its previous content. Otherwise, `s` will contain '1', '0', and '0'.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues if `i` is less than 30, we need to increment `i` by 1.
   - We don't have information about the value of `x` or the exact content of `s` from the previous iteration, but we know that `s` must still contain at least one '1' for the loop to continue.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the incremented value of `i` and the fact that `s` must still contain at least one '1'.

**State:**
- `i` is `i + 2` (since it was `i + 1` before and now it needs to be incremented by 1 more).
- `s` is a list containing at least one '1'.

So, the final state is:

State: **`i` is `i + 2` and less than 30, and `s` is a list containing at least one '1'**.
