Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Other variables remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for nalla in range(t):
    x = int(input())
    s = []
    length = 30
    for i in range(30):
        if x & pow(2, i):
            s.append('1')
        else:
            s.append('0')
    flag = 0
    for i in range(0, 29):
        if flag and s[i] == '0':
            s[i] = '1'
            flag = 0
        if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
            s[i] = '-1'
            flag = 1
        elif flag == 1:
            s[i] = '0'
        else:
            pass
    if flag and s[29] == '0':
        s[29] = '1'
    elif flag:
        s[29] = '0'
        s.append('1')
        length += 1
    for i in range(1, length):
        if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
            s[i] = '0'
            s[i - 1] = '-1'
    print(length)
    print(*s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The string `s` has been modified according to the loop's conditions, with specific changes occurring at certain indices. The variable `i` will be equal to `length - 1`, indicating the last iteration of the loop. The variable `length` remains unchanged from its initial value. The string `s` will have undergone modifications as follows:

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `flag` is 0, `i` is 30, `n` is 29, `s[1]` is '0', `s[29]` is '1', `s[30]` is '0', and the length of the string `s` is greater than 30.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is 28, `length` is 30, `x` is an integer whose binary representation determines the values in the list `s`. The list `s` has 30 elements where `s[j]` for each index `j` from 0 to 28 is either '1', '-1', or '0' based on the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x`. Specifically, `s[j]` is '1' if the j-th bit of `x` is 1, '-1' if the j-th bit is 1 and the previous bit (j-1) was '1', and '0' otherwise. The last element `s[29]` is '1' if the 29th bit of `x` is 1, and '0' otherwise. The variable `flag` remains 0 throughout the loop.

This state is derived from the given rules and the fact that the loop runs 29 times, updating the list `s` according to the specified conditions.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
