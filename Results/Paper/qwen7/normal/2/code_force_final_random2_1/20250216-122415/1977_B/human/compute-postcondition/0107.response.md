Output State: **`i` must be less than 30, and `(x & pow(2, i))` is False; `s` contains '0'**.

Explanation: The code appends the string `'0'` to the list `s`. The conditions on `i` and the bitwise operation involving `x` and `pow(2, i)` remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` must still be less than 30, and the condition `(x & pow(2, i))` is still False. The list `s` now contains the element `'0'`.
