Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an integer, `s` is a list of 30 elements where the 3rd element is now '-1', `flag` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `s[i] = '-1'` changes the value of the 3rd element (index 2) of the list `s` to '-1'. The values of `i`, `x`, and `flag` remain unchanged from their initial states.
