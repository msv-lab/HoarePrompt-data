Output State: **`i` is 30; `length` is greater than 29; `s[30]` is '0'**

The code `s[i] = '0'` assigns the value `'0'` to the index `i` in the list `s`. Given that `i` is 30, `s[30]` is now `'0'`. The value of `length` being greater than 29 remains unchanged, and the value of `i` also remains unchanged.
