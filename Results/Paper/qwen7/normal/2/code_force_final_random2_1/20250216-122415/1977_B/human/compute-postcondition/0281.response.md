The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `length`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `length`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `length`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `length` is 30. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. The value of `length` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `length` is 30**
