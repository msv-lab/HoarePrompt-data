Postcondition: **`flag` is 0, the character at index `i` of string `s` is either '0' or '1', and either the character at index `i+2` is not '1' or `s[i+2]` does not exist.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the if condition is met or not, the final state of `flag` will be 0, and the character at index `i` of string `s` will remain either '0' or '1', with the condition that the character at index `i+2` is not '1' or does not exist.
