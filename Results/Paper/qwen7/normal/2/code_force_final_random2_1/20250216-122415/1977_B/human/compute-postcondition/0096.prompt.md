Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `flag` is 0; if `flag` was 1 and the 29th bit of the string `s` is '1', the 29th bit remains unchanged. If `flag` was 0 and the 29th bit is '0', an additional '1' is appended to the string `s`, increasing its length by 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, length):
    if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
        s[i] = '0'
        s[i - 1] = '-1'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `length` must be greater than 1, and `s[i]` is '0'. If `s[i]` is '-1' and `s[i - 1]` is '1', then `s[i]` remains '0'. Since there is no else part, no other changes occur.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `length` must be greater than 1, and `s[2]` remains '0'. If `s[1]` is '-1', then `s[i-1]` remains '1'. Otherwise, no changes are made to the string `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `length` must be greater than 2, `s[2]` remains '0', and `s[3]` is now '-1'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
