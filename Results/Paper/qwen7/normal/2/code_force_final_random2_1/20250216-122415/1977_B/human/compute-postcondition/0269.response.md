Postcondition: **`i` is 28, `x` is an integer, and `s` is a list of 30 elements. The value of `flag` is 1. For each index `j` from 0 to 28 in `s`, if the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x` is set to 1, then `s[j]` is either '1' or '-1'; otherwise, `s[j]` is '0'. Additionally, `s[29]` is not '0', meaning it is either '1', '-1', or '0' depending on the value of `x` at the 29th position in its binary representation.**
