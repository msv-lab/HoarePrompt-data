Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a series of test cases where each test case consists of a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` pairs of positive integers `x` (1 ≤ x < 2^30). For each `x`, the function determines whether `x` falls within the specified range and returns a result based on the conditions given.**

However, since the function definition itself does not accept any parameters, the description focuses on the implied behavior based on the provided constraints and output cases.
