Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variables `i` and `length`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `length`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `length` is 30
   - If `s[1]` is '-1', no changes are made to the variables.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2 and `length` is 30, the condition `i < length` is true, so the loop can continue.
   - After the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 3.
   - The value of `length` remains unchanged at 30.
   - The condition regarding `s[1]` does not affect the values of `i` or `length`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `length` is 30**
