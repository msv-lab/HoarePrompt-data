Output State: **`i` is `i + 1` and less than 30, `s` is a list containing '1', '0', and '0'.**

Explanation: The code appends '0' to the list `s`. Since `i` was initially `i + 1` (less than 30) and `s` contained either '1' or '0', after appending '0', `s` now contains '1', '0', and '0'. The value of `i` remains unchanged as the code only modified the list `s`.
