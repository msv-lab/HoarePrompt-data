Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is the value of `int(input())`, `x` is the value of `int(input())`, `s` is a list containing either '1' or '0' with an additional element '0' appended to it, `length` is 30.**

The code appends the string `'0'` to the list `s`. The length of `s` remains 30 because appending one element increases its length by one. All other variables (`i`, `t`, `x`, and `length`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
