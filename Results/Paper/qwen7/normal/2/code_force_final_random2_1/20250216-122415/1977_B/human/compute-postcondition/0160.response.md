Output State: **`flag` is 0, `i` is 3, `n` is 29, `s[1]` is '0'**

Explanation: The code `s[i] = '-1'` changes the value of `s[1]` from its original value (which was '1' based on the condition given) to '-1'. Since `i` is 3, it does not affect `s[1]`. The values of `flag` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, `s[1]` is now '0'.
