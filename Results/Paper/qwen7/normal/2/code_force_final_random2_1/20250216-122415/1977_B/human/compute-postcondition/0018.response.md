Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is the value of `int(input())`, `x` is the value of `int(input())`, `s` is a list containing '1', '0', and '1', `length` is 30**.

The code `s.append('1')` adds the string `'1'` to the list `s`. Initially, `s` contains either `'1'` or `'0'` and an additional element which is also either `'1'` or `'0'`. After appending `'1'`, `s` now contains `'1'`, `'0'`, and `'1'`. The values of `i`, `t`, `x`, and `length` remain unchanged from their initial states.
