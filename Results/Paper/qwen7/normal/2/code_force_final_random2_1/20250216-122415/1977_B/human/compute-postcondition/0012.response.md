Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `length`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `t` is the value of `int(input())`.
   - `x` is the value of `int(input())`.
   - `s` is a list containing either '1' or '0'.
   - `length` is 30.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < 30`. Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than 30.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1.
   - The value of `length` remains unchanged at 30.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `t` remains the value of `int(input())`.
   - `x` remains the value of `int(input())`.
   - `s` remains a list containing either '1' or '0'.
   - `length` remains 30.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 1, `t` is the value of `int(input())`, `x` is the value of `int(input())`, `s` is a list containing either '1' or '0', `length` is 30**.
