Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is the value of `int(input())`, `x` is the value of `int(input())`, `s` is a list containing '1', `length` is 30, and the current value of `x` when ANDed with 2 raised to the power of `i` results in a non-zero value.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s.append('1')` appends the string `'1'` to the list `s`. Initially, `s` is an empty list. After executing the code, `s` becomes a list containing `'1'`. The values of `i`, `t`, `x`, and `length` remain unchanged from their initial states. Additionally, the condition that the current value of `x` when ANDed with \(2\) raised to the power of `i` results in a non-zero value is still valid.
