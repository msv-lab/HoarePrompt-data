Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an integer, `s` is a list of 30 elements where the 3rd element (index 2) is '1'.**

The code `s[i] = '1'` assigns the string `'1'` to the index `i` in the list `s`. Given that `i` is 2, the third element of the list `s` is updated to `'1'`. The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged, and `s` is still a list of 30 elements.
