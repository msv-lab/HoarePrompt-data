Output State: **`flag` is 0; `s` is a string with '0' at index 29 and an additional '1' appended to it; `length` is 1 more than its original value.**

Explanation: The initial state includes `flag` being 0, `s` having '0' at index 29, and `s` having an additional '1' appended to it. The code snippet increments `length` by 1. Since `length` was not initialized before, we assume it was 0 (or some other value that is not specified). After executing `length += 1`, `length` is 1 more than its original value. All other variables remain unchanged.
