Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Bitwise Representation**: The initial approach of using bitwise operations to generate the binary representation of `x` is correct, but the subsequent modifications to ensure no consecutive non-zero elements are unnecessary and may lead to incorrect results.

2. **Handling Consecutive Non-Zero Elements**: The logic to handle consecutive non-zero elements is overly complex and may not always produce a valid result. For example, it may incorrectly change `-1` to `0` and `1` to `-1`, which violates the requirement that `a_i` can only be `1`, `0`, or `-1`.

3. **Length Calculation**: The length calculation should be based on the actual number of bits used to represent `x`, not a fixed value of 30. This can be derived from the highest set bit position.

4. **Final Adjustments**: The final adjustments to ensure no consecutive non-zero elements are unnecessary and may lead to incorrect results. The logic to flip signs and adjust lengths is overly complex and may not always produce a valid result.

### Correct Approach:
A simpler and more direct approach would be to directly convert the integer `x` to its binary representation and then adjust the representation to ensure no consecutive non-zero elements. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        # Convert x to binary representation and pad with leading zeros
        binary_representation = bin(x)[2:].zfill(30)
        # Ensure no consecutive non-zero elements
        result = []
        for i, bit in enumerate(binary_representation):
            if bit == '1':
                if i > 0 and result[-1] == '1':
                    result[-1] = '-1'
                else:
                    result.append('1')
            elif bit == '0':
                result.append('0')
        # If the last bit is 0, we need to add a 1 at the end
        if result[-1] == '0':
            result[-1] = '1'
        # Determine the length of the resulting array
        length = len(result)
        print(length)
        print(*result)

func()
```

This approach ensures that the binary representation of `x` is correctly converted and adjusted to meet the problem requirements.
