Postcondition: `i` is 1, `x` is an integer, `s` is a list of 30 elements. If `flag` is 1, the first element of `s` will be set to '-1' if `s[1]` equals `s[2]` and both are '1'. Otherwise, the first element of `s` will remain '0'. If `flag` is 0 and `s[1]` is '0', the first element of `s` will remain '1'. Otherwise, the first two elements of `s` will both be '1'.
