Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 28.
- `length` is 30.
- `x` is an integer whose binary representation determines the values in the list `s`.
- The list `s` has 30 elements where `s[j]` for each index `j` from 0 to 28 is determined by the bits of `x` as described.
- The last element `s[29]` is '1' if the 29th bit of `x` is 1, and '0' otherwise.
- The variable `flag` remains 0 throughout the loop.

The `print(length)` statement will print the value of the variable `length`.

Output: **30**
