Output State: **After the loop executes all 30 iterations, `i` will be 29, `x` will still be an integer, and `s` will be a list of 30 elements. Each element in `s` will be '1' if the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x` is set to 1, and '0' otherwise.**

This means that `s` will contain the binary representation of `x`, with each bit of `x` corresponding to an element in `s`. Since the loop runs 30 times, `s` will have exactly 30 elements, representing the binary form of `x` up to the 29th bit (as the 30th iteration would check the 30th bit, which is beyond the length of a typical 32-bit integer).
