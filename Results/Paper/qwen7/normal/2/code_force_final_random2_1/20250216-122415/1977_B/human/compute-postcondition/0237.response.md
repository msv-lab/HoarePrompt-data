Postcondition: `i` is 0, `x` is an integer, `s` is a list of 30 elements. If `flag` is 0, the first element of `s` is '1' and the second element is '1', and the third element is '-1'. If `flag` is 1, the first element of `s` is '0'. Otherwise, the first two elements of `s` are both '1' and `flag` is 0.
