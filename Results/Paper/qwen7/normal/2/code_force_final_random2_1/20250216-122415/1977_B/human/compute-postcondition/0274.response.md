Postcondition: **After the loop executes all 29 iterations, `i` is 28, `x` is an integer, and `s` is a list of 30 elements. The value of `s[j]` for each index `j` from 0 to 28 follows the rules based on the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x`: if the bit is set to 1, `s[j]` is either '1' or '-1'; otherwise, `s[j]` is '0'. If `flag` was set to 1 during any iteration, the value of `s[j]` for the last `j` where `flag` was 1 will be '0'. `s[29]` is '1' if the 29th bit of `x` is set to 1, and '0' otherwise. `flag` remains 0.**
