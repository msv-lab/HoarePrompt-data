Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `s` is a list containing at least one '1' and an additional '0'.**

Explanation: The code `s.append('0')` adds the string `'0'` to the list `s`. Since `s` initially contains at least one `'1'`, after appending `'0'`, `s` will contain at least one `'1'` and an additional `'0'`. The value of `i` is updated to `i + 2` from the previous state where it was `i + 1`.
