Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, followed by \( t \) pairs of positive integers \( x \) (1 ≤ \( x \) < 2^30). For each \( x \), it constructs a list \( s \) of length 30 based on the binary representation of \( x \). It then modifies \( s \) according to specific rules involving adjacent bits and updates the length of the list accordingly. Finally, it prints the length of the modified list \( s \) and the list itself.**
