The function accepts a string `s` consisting of 'U' and 'D', where 'U' represents coins facing up and 'D' represents coins facing down. It checks if the number of 'U' (coins facing up) is odd. If the count of 'U' is odd, the function returns 'YES', indicating that the string can be read from start to end without ever having more 'D' than 'U'. Otherwise, it returns 'NO', indicating that such a condition cannot be met.
