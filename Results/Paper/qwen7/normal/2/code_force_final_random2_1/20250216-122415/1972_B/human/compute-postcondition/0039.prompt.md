Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `index` is 2, `t` is an integer from the list `data`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a string of length n consisting of only "U" and "D", `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    s = data[index]
    index += 1
    num_up_coins = s.count('U')
    if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `index` is increased by 2, `s` is the value at `data[index]`, `num_up_coins` is the number of 'U' characters in `s`. If `num_up_coins` is odd, the `results` list now contains 'YES'. If `num_up_coins` is even, the `results` list now contains 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer and decreased by 1, `index` is increased by 8, `num_up_coins` is the number of 'U' characters in `data[index]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, results list now contains either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether the number of 'U' characters in `data[index]` is odd or even, `s` is updated to be the value at `data[index]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, `index` is increased by 10, `num_up_coins` is the number of 'U' characters in `data[index]`, `results` list now contains either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether the number of 'U' characters in `data[index]` is odd or even, `s` is updated to be the value at `data[index]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `num_up_coins` is the number of 'U' characters in `data[index]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
