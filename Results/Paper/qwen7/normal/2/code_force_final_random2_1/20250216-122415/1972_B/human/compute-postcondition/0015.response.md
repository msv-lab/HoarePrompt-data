Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `index` is increased by 2, `s` is the value at `data[index]`, `num_up_coins` is the number of 'U' characters in `s` (which is even), results list now contains 'NO'**.

The code appends the string `'NO'` to the `results` list. The values of `t`, `index`, `s`, and `num_up_coins` remain unchanged from their initial states. The only new information is that the `results` list now includes the string `'NO'`.
