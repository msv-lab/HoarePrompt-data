Output State: **`t` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, `index` is increased by 9, `num_up_coins` is the number of 'U' characters in `data[index]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `results` list now contains either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether the number of 'U' characters in `data[index]` is odd or even, `s` is updated to be the value at `data[index]`; `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`.**

The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the new value of `index` is the original value plus 1, making it increased by 9 in total (since it was initially increased by 8).
