Based on the initial state provided:

- `results` is a list containing at least one element.
- `result` is the third element of the `results` list.
- `index` is equal to the total number of elements in the `data` list.
- `t` is 0.
- `n` and `s` are set according to the last iteration's values (though their specific values are not needed to determine the output of the print statement).

The print statement is `print(result)`, which will print the third element of the `results` list.

Output: **result (which is the third element of the `results` list)**
