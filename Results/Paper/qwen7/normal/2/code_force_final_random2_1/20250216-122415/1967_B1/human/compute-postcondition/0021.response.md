Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is `n + (n + (min(n, m) + 2)) // ((min(n, m) + 2) * (min(n, m) + 2)) + (n + min(n, m) + 2) // ((min(n, m) + 2) * (min(n, m) + 2))`, `b` is `min(n, m) + 2`, `min(n, m)` must be at least 2.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by adding `(n + b) // (b * b)` to the current value of `ans`. Here, `b` is defined as `min(n, m) + 2`. Since `ans` was initially defined as `n + (n + (min(n, m) + 2)) // ((min(n, m) + 2) * (min(n, m) + 2))`, the new value of `ans` becomes `n + (n + (min(n, m) + 2)) // ((min(n, m) + 2) * (min(n, m) + 2)) + (n + min(n, m) + 2) // ((min(n, m) + 2) * (min(n, m) + 2))`. All other variables remain unchanged.
