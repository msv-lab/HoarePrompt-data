Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes two positive integers n and m. For each test case, the function checks if the conditions 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6 are met and ensures that the sum of n and m across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6. The function returns results based on these conditions for each test case.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing two integers n and m, ensuring they meet specified constraints, and returns appropriate results for each test case based on those constraints.
