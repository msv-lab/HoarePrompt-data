Output State: **`n` is equal to `ans`, `m` must satisfy `min(n, m) >= 4`, `b` is 4, and `ans` is equal to `2 * ans`.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by adding `(n + b) // (b * b)` to its current value. Given that `b` is 4, the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` simplifies to `(n + 4) // (4 * 4)`, which is `(n + 4) // 16`. Since `n` is equal to `ans`, the expression further simplifies to `(ans + 4) // 16`. This means `ans` is updated to `ans + (ans + 4) // 16`. However, without the exact value of `n` (or `ans`), we know that `ans` is doubled because `(ans + 4) // 16` is a non-negative integer and does not affect the doubling significantly unless `ans` is very close to a multiple of 16, but generally, it results in `ans` being effectively doubled. The other variables (`m` and `b`) remain unchanged.
