Output State: **`n` is the first string input, `m` is the second string input**.

Explanation: The code `n, m = input().split()` takes a single line of input and splits it into two parts using whitespace as the delimiter. The first part is assigned to `n` and the second part to `m`. Since the initial values of `n` and `m` are not specified, they are represented as the first and second strings input respectively. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
