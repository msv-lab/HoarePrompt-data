Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Statement Recap:
- We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Given Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)
```

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, we read two integers \(n\) and \(m\).

2. **Initialization:**
   - `ans` is initialized to `n`. This seems to be an initial guess but does not align with the problem requirements.

3. **Loop Over Possible Values of \(b\):**
   - The loop iterates from \(2\) to \(\min(n, m)\).
   - For each \(b\), it adds \((n + b) // (b * b)\) to `ans`.

4. **Output:**
   - The final value of `ans` is printed.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Calculation:**
   - The expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\). This expression does not account for the gcd term at all.

2. **Missing Key Logic:**
   - The program does not correctly iterate through all possible values of \(a\) for each \(b\).
   - It does not check the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\).

3. **Incorrect Initialization:**
   - Starting `ans` with `n` is not appropriate because it does not consider the constraints and conditions specified in the problem.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. It does not properly account for the gcd condition and the range of \(a\) for each \(b\).

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
