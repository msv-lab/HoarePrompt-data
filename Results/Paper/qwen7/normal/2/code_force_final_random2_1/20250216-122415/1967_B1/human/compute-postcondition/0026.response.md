Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is 1 (though this variable is not used in the calculation of `ans`).
- `n` is an integer.
- `m` is an integer.
- `ans` is the sum of `n` and the expression \((n + b) // (b * b)\) for each `b` from `min(n, m) + 1` to `min(n, m)`.
- `b` is set to `min(n, m) + 4` after the loop completes.
- `min(n, m)` must be at least 3.

Given that `min(n, m)` must be at least 3, let's denote `k = min(n, m)`. Therefore, `k` is at least 3. The loop runs from `k + 1` to `k`, which means it only runs once because the range is from `k + 1` to `k`, and there are no integers in this range. Thus, the loop body does not execute, and `ans` remains `n`.

After the loop, `b` is set to `k + 4`. Since `k` is at least 3, `b` will be at least 7.

Therefore, the value of `ans` is simply `n`.

Output: **n**
