The code snippet `[n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]` converts the inputs `n` and `m` from strings to integers. This means that `n` and `m` are now integers, and the values of `t`, `ans`, `b`, and `min(n, m)` remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is equal to `n` + 1 + (n + 3) // 9 + (n + 4) // 16 + (n + 5) // 25 + ... + (n + min(n, m)) // (min(n, m) * min(n, m)), `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`, `min(n, m)` must be at least 2.**
