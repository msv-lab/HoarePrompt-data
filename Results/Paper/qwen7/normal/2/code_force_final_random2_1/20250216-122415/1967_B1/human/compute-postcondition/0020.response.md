Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `b`, which ranges from `2` to `min(n, m) + 1`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is 1
   - `n` is an integer
   - `m` is an integer
   - `ans` is `n + (n + b) // (b * b)`
   - `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`
   - `min(n, m)` must be at least 2

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `b` is within the range `[2, min(n, m) + 1]`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `b` was set to `min(n, m) + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `b` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `b` will now be `min(n, m) + 2`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `t` remains unchanged at 1.
   - `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
   - `ans` is recalculated based on the new value of `b`.
   - `b` is updated to `min(n, m) + 2`.
   - `min(n, m)` must still be at least 2.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is `n + (n + (min(n, m) + 2)) // ((min(n, m) + 2) * (min(n, m) + 2))`, `b` is `min(n, m) + 2`, `min(n, m)` must be at least 2**
