Output State: **`permutation'` is updated such that the element at index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is now `curr_v + 1`, `curr_v` is increased by 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is increased by `k`, and `multiples_of_k_plus_i + k < len(permutation)`; `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `curr_v + 1`, and `curr_v` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `curr_v` has been increased by 1, and `multiples_of_k_plus_i` has also been increased by `k`. The condition `multiples_of_k_plus_i + k < len(permutation)` remains true, and the element at the updated index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` in `permutation` is now `curr_v + 1`.
