Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)`.

2. **Current values at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `k` is 2
   - `permutation` is a list where the indices that are multiples of `k` (which is 2) are filled with consecutive integers starting from 2
   - `idx_v` is `len(permutation)`
   - `curr_v` is `len(permutation) + 2`
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 9
   - `len(permutation)` is at least 10
   - `permutation[7]` is 13

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `len(permutation)`.
   - Currently, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 9 and `len(permutation)` is at least 10.
   - Therefore, to ensure the loop executes one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be adjusted to be less than `len(permutation)`.

Since the only variable in the loop head is `multiples_of_k_plus_i`, we need to adjust this variable to ensure the loop condition is met.

**State:**
State: **`i` is 1, `k` is 2, `permutation` is a list where the indices that are multiples of `k` are filled with consecutive integers starting from 2, `idx_v` is `len(permutation)`, `curr_v` is `len(permutation) + 2`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `len(permutation)`, `len(permutation)` is at least 10, `permutation[7]` is 13**
