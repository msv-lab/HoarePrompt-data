Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly generate a k-level permutation. The logic in `func_1` is flawed because it simply assigns values in a pattern without ensuring that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` meet the k-level condition. Specifically, the approach of incrementing values by `1` and placing them at positions determined by `i` and `k` does not guarantee that the difference between any two sums of segments of length `k` will be no more than `1`.

To construct a k-level permutation, a more sophisticated approach is needed. One possible method involves creating a sequence that ensures the sums of any segment of length `k` are as close as possible. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    permutation = [0] * n
    idx = 0
    idx_v = 1
    curr_v = 1
    for i in range(n // k):
        for j in range(k):
            permutation[idx] = curr_v
            idx += 1
            if idx >= n:
                break
            curr_v += 1
        curr_v -= k
    # Adjust the last segment if necessary
    if n % k != 0:
        start_idx = n - (n % k)
        for j in range(n % k):
            permutation[start_idx + j] = curr_v
            curr_v += 1
    result = ' '.join([str(v) for v in permutation])
    print(result)

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        func_1()
        t -= 1
```

This corrected version ensures that the values are distributed in a way that the sums of any segment of length `k` are as close as possible, thus fulfilling the k-level condition. However, this still may not guarantee the exact solution due to the complexity of the problem. A more rigorous approach would involve dynamic programming or other optimization techniques to ensure the exact k-level condition is met.
