Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is an even integer and `k` must be less than `n`, `2k < len(permutation)`, `curr_v` is `curr_v + 1`**.

Explanation: The value of `curr_v` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`i`, `k`, and the condition involving `n` and `permutation`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
