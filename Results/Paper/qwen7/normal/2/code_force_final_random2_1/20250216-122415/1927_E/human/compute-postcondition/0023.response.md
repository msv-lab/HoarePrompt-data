Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is an even integer and `k` must be less than `n`, `permutation` is a list where the indices that are multiples of `k` are filled with consecutive integers starting from 2, `idx_v` is `len(permutation)`, `curr_v` is `len(permutation) + 1`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 1**.

Explanation: The line `multiples_of_k_plus_i = i` updates the variable `multiples_of_k_plus_i` to be equal to the current value of `i`, which is 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
