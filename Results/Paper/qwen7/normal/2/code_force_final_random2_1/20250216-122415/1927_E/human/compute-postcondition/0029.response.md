Output State: **`len(permutation)` is greater than 4; `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is assigned the value of `curr_v`**.

This means that the length of the `permutation` list has been ensured to be greater than 4, and the element at index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` in the `permutation` list has been updated to the value of `curr_v`. All other variables remain in their initial or unchanged states.
