Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is an even integer and `k` must be less than `n`, `2k < len(permutation)`, `curr_v` is `curr_v + 1`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `k`.**

Explanation: The line `multiples_of_k_plus_i += k` adds the value of `k` to `multiples_of_k_plus_i`. Since `i` is 0, `k` is an even integer less than `n`, and `2k < len(permutation)`, the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` becomes `k`. The other variables remain unchanged.
