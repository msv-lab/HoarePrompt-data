Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `i`: This variable is being incremented in the loop.
   - `k`: This variable is a constant and does not change within the loop.
   - `permutation`: This list is being modified within the loop.
   - `idx_v`: This variable tracks the length of the `permutation` list.
   - `curr_v`: This variable is incremented within the loop.
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_i`: This variable is incremented by `k` in each iteration.

2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `k` is an even integer and `k` must be less than `n`.
   - `permutation` is a list where the indices that are multiples of `k` are filled with consecutive integers starting from 2.
   - `idx_v` is `len(permutation)`.
   - `curr_v` is `len(permutation) + 1`.
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `3k`.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)`.

4. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `1`.
   - The value of `k` remains unchanged.
   - The `permutation` list may be modified within the loop, but we need to focus on the loop head variables.
   - `idx_v` will be incremented to `len(permutation) + 1` after the first iteration.
   - `curr_v` will be incremented to `len(permutation) + 2` after the first iteration.
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be incremented by `k` to `4k` after the first iteration.

5. **New State for the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - `i` will be `1`.
   - `k` remains an even integer and must still be less than `n`.
   - `permutation` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `idx_v` will be `len(permutation) + 1`.
   - `curr_v` will be `len(permutation) + 2`.
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be `4k`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `i` is 1, `k` is an even integer and `k` must be less than `n`, `permutation` is a list where the indices that are multiples of `k` are filled with consecutive integers starting from 2, `idx_v` is `len(permutation) + 1`, `curr_v` is `len(permutation) + 2`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `4k`.**
