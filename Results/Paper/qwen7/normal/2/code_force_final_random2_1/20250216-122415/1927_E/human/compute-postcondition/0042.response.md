Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is 2, `permutation` is a list where the indices that are multiples of `k` are filled with consecutive integers starting from 2, `idx_v` is `len(permutation)`, `curr_v` is `len(permutation) + 2`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `7`, `len(permutation)` is at least `10`, `permutation[7]` is `13**.

Explanation: The code `curr_v += 1` increments the value of `curr_v` by 1. Initially, `curr_v` was set to `len(permutation) + k * 3 + 1`. Given `k` is 2, `curr_v` was `len(permutation) + 2 * 3 + 1`. After incrementing, `curr_v` becomes `len(permutation) + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
