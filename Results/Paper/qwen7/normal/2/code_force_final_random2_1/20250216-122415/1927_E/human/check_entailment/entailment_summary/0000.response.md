Reasoning:
1. The problem requires constructing a k-level permutation of length n for each test case.
2. A k-level permutation is defined such that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any continuous segment of length k is at most 1.
3. The provided solution consists of two functions:
   - `func_1()`: This function is supposed to generate a k-level permutation for a single test case. However, the provided code for `func_1()` does not actually ensure that the generated permutation is k-level. It simply places consecutive integers starting from 2 at indices that are multiples of `k`, which does not guarantee the k-level property.
   - `func_2()`: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case. However, since `func_1()` does not correctly generate a k-level permutation, `func_2()` will not produce the required output either.

Given that the provided implementation of `func_1()` does not meet the requirement of generating a k-level permutation, the overall program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
