Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `multiples_of_k_plus_i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)`.

3. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `k` is an even integer and `k` must be less than `n`
   - `permutation` is a list where the indices that are multiples of `k` are filled with consecutive integers starting from 2
   - `idx_v` is `len(permutation)`
   - `curr_v` is `len(permutation) + k * 3 + 1`
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `1 + 3 * k`
   - `len(permutation)` is at least `4 + 2*k`

4. **Determine the necessary adjustment**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `len(permutation)`.
   - Given that `multiples_of_k_plus_i = 1 + 3 * k` and `len(permutation) >= 4 + 2*k`, we need to check if `1 + 3 * k < 4 + 2 * k`.
   - Simplifying the inequality: `1 + 3 * k < 4 + 2 * k` simplifies to `k < 3`.
   - Since `k` is an even integer and must be less than `n`, the smallest possible value for `k` that satisfies this condition is `k = 2` (as `k` cannot be 0 because `1 + 3 * k` would be 1, which is not less than `4 + 2 * k`).

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - To ensure the loop executes the first time, `k` must be set to the smallest even integer that satisfies the condition, which is `k = 2`.
   - With `k = 2`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i = 1 + 3 * 2 = 7` and `len(permutation) >= 4 + 2 * 2 = 8`, so `7 < 8` holds true.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure `k` is 2.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `k` is 2 (an even integer), `k` must be less than `n`, `permutation` is a list where the indices that are multiples of `k` are filled with consecutive integers starting from 2, `idx_v` is `len(permutation)`, `curr_v` is `len(permutation) + k * 3 + 1`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `1 + 3 * k`, `len(permutation)` is at least `4 + 2*k`**
