Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes two integers `n` and `k` as space-separated inputs. It checks if `k` is even and if both `2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5`. Based on these conditions, it returns either an error message if the conditions are not met or proceeds further (though the specific further actions are not detailed here).**

This means the function expects `n` and `k` to be provided as inputs in a specific format and checks if they meet certain criteria before potentially returning a result or an error message.
