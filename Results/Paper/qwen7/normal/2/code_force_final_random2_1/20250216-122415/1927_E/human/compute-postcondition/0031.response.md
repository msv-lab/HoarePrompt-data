Output State: **`len(permutation)` is greater than 4; `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is increased by `k`; `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is equal to `curr_v + 1`**

Explanation: The code `multiples_of_k_plus_i += k` increments the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` by `k`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the length of the permutation list is still greater than 4, and the value of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` remains `curr_v + 1`.
