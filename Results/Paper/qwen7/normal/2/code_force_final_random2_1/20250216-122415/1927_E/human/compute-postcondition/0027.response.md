Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is an even integer and `k` must be less than `n`, `permutation` is a list where the indices that are multiples of `k` are filled with consecutive integers starting from 2, `idx_v` is `len(permutation)`, `curr_v` is `len(permutation) + 2`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 4, `len(permutation)` must be at least 2**

Explanation: The code `multiples_of_k_plus_i += k` increments the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` by the value of `k`. Since `k` is an even integer and `k` must be less than `n`, the initial value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 2. After adding `k` (an even number), the new value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 2 + `k`, which simplifies to 4 because `k` is an even integer and the smallest even integer is 2, making the minimum value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
