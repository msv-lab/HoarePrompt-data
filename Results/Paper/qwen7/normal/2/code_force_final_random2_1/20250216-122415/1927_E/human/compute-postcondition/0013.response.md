Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and k is even. For each test case, it calls `func_1()` which is not defined in the provided code. After processing all test cases, it ensures that the variable `t` is set to 0.**
