You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, k is even, and the values of n and k are provided as space-separated inputs on a single line for each test case.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split(' '))
    permutation = [0] * n
    idx = 0
    idx_v = 1
    curr_v = 1
    for i in range(k):
        multiples_of_k_plus_i = i
        
        while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
            permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] = curr_v
            curr_v += 1
            multiples_of_k_plus_i += k
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is 2, `k` is an even integer and `k` must be less than `n`, `permutation` is a list where the indices that are multiples of `k` are filled with consecutive integers starting from 2, `idx_v` is `len(permutation)`, `curr_v` is `len(permutation) + 2 * 3 * (k/2) + 1`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `len(permutation)`, and `len(permutation)` is at least `k * (k/2) + 1`.
    #
    #**Explanation:**
    #- The loop iterates `k` times, and for each iteration `i`, it updates the `permutation` list at indices that are multiples of `k + i`.
    #- After `k` iterations, the loop will have filled all necessary indices in the `permutation` list that are multiples of `k`.
    #- The variable `i` will be `k - 1` after the last iteration, but since the loop uses `i` in the range `range(k)`, `i` will be `k - 1` just before the loop exits.
    #- `curr_v` starts at `len(permutation) + 1` and increments by 1 for each assignment made in the inner while loop. Since the loop runs `k` times and each time it makes `n // k` assignments (assuming `n` is large enough), `curr_v` will be `len(permutation) + k * (n // k)`.
    #- Given that `k` is even and the loop runs `k` times, the total number of assignments is `k * (n // k)`, leading to `curr_v` being `len(permutation) + 2 * 3 * (k/2) + 1` if we assume the worst-case scenario where `n` is just enough to fill all required indices.
    #- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be equal to `len(permutation)` because the loop exits when `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is no longer less than `len(permutation)`.
    #- `idx_v` remains `len(permutation)` because it is updated to the length of the `permutation` list after each assignment.
    #- `permutation` will have consecutive integers starting from 2 at all indices that are multiples of `k`, and the length of `permutation` will be at least `k * (k/2) + 1` to ensure all necessary indices are filled.
    result = ' '.join([str(v) for v in permutation])
    print(result)
    #This is printed: 2 3 4
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes two integers `n` and `k` as space-separated inputs. It checks if `k` is even and if both `2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5`. Based on these conditions, it returns either an error message if the conditions are not met or proceeds further (though the specific further actions are not detailed here).

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
