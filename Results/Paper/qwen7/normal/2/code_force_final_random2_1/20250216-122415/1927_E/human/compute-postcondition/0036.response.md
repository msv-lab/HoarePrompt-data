Output State: `i` is 1, `k` is an even integer and `k` must be less than `n`, `permutation` is a list where the indices that are multiples of `k` are filled with consecutive integers starting from 2, `idx_v` is `len(permutation)`, `curr_v` is `len(permutation) + k * 3 + 1`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `len(permutation)`, `len(permutation)` is at least 4 + 2*k.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be equal to the length of the `permutation` list because the condition `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)` will no longer be true. The value of `curr_v` will be incremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop, so it will be `len(permutation) + 1 + 3*k`. Given that the loop runs until `multiples_of_k_plus_i` reaches the length of `permutation`, and considering that `multiples_of_k_plus_i` starts at `k` and increases by `k` each time, the final value of `curr_v` will be `len(permutation) + k * 3 + 1`. The length of `permutation` will be at least 4 + 2*k because the loop increments `permutation` by at least 2*k over 3 iterations.
