To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the given states:

### Loop Condition Analysis
The loop condition is:
```python
while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
```
For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)` must be true.

### Given States
- `i` is 1
- `k` is an even integer and `k` must be less than `n`
- `permutation` is a list where the indices that are multiples of `k` are filled with consecutive integers starting from 2
- `idx_v` is `len(permutation)`
- `curr_v` is `len(permutation) + 2`
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 4
- `len(permutation)` must be at least 2

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Current Value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i`:**
   - The current value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 4.

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `len(permutation)`.

3. **Determine `len(permutation)`:**
   - Since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 4, for the loop to continue, `len(permutation)` must be greater than 4.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - We need to ensure that `len(permutation)` is greater than 4. 

### Conclusion
The only state that needs to be adjusted is `len(permutation)` to ensure that the loop condition `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)` holds true.

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is 1, `k` is an even integer and `k` must be less than `n`, `permutation` is a list where the indices that are multiples of `k` are filled with consecutive integers starting from 2, `idx_v` is `len(permutation)`, `curr_v` is `len(permutation) + 2`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 4, `len(permutation)` must be greater than 4**
