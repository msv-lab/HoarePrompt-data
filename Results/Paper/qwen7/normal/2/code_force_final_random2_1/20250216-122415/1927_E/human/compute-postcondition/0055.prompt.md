Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `idx` is 1, `n` is an integer with the value of the first input, `k` is an integer with the value of the second input, both inputs are separated by a space, and 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, k is even; `permutation` is a list of n zeros, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    multiples_of_k_plus_i = i
    while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
        permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] = curr_v
        curr_v += 1
        multiples_of_k_plus_i += k


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `i` is 0, `k` is an even integer and `k` must be less than `n`, `permutation` is a list where the indices that are multiples of `k` are filled with consecutive integers starting from 2, `idx_v` is `len(permutation)`, `curr_v` is `len(permutation) + 1`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `3k`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be equal to or greater than the length of the `permutation` list. This means the loop condition `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)` will no longer be satisfied, causing the loop to terminate. At this point, the `permutation` list will have been filled with consecutive integers starting from 2 at positions that are multiples of `k`. The variable `idx_v` will be equal to the length of the `permutation` list because it increments each time `curr_v` is incremented within the loop. Similarly, `curr_v` will be one more than the length of the `permutation` list since it starts at 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration of the loop. The value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be `3k` because the loop increments `multiples_of_k_plus_i` by `k` in each iteration and runs for 3 iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `i` is 1, `k` is an even integer and `k` must be less than `n`, `permutation` is a list where the indices that are multiples of `k` are filled with consecutive integers starting from 2, `idx_v` is `len(permutation)`, `curr_v` is `len(permutation) + k * 3 + 1`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `len(permutation)`, `len(permutation)` is at least 4 + 2*k.

**Explanation:**
- The loop continues as long as `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is less than the length of `permutation`.
- After each iteration, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` increases by `k`, and `curr_v` increases by 1.
- Given that the loop executed 3 times, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be incremented by `k` three times, making it `3 * k` more than its initial value.
- Since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` starts at 1 and increments by `k` each time, after 3 iterations, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be `1 + 3 * k`.
- However, since the loop exits when `multiples_of_k_plus_i` equals the length of `permutation`, we can say `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is exactly `len(permutation)`.
- Initially, `curr_v` was set to `len(permutation) + 1`. After 3 iterations, `curr_v` will be `len(permutation) + 1 + 3`, which simplifies to `len(permutation) + 4 - 1` (since the loop increments `curr_v` 3 times).
- Therefore, `curr_v` is `len(permutation) + 3 + 1` or `len(permutation) + k * 3 + 1`.

Thus, the final state of the variables after the loop completes all its iterations is as described.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is 1, `k` is 2, `permutation` is a list where the indices that are multiples of `k` (2) are filled with consecutive integers starting from 2, `idx_v` is `len(permutation)`, `curr_v` is `len(permutation) + 2 * 3 + 1`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `len(permutation)`, `len(permutation)` is at least 14, and the elements of `permutation` at indices that are multiples of `k` follow the pattern of being incremented by 1 with each iteration of the loop until all relevant indices are filled.

To break it down further:
- Initially, `permutation` starts with some elements set to consecutive integers starting from 2 at indices that are multiples of `k`.
- After the loop runs for 3 iterations, the next value to be assigned to `permutation` at the next multiple of `k` would be `curr_v + 1`, which is `len(permutation) + 7` (since `curr_v` was `len(permutation) + 7` after 3 iterations).
- The loop continues until `multiples_of_k_plus_i` reaches or exceeds `len(permutation)`. Given the initial conditions and the loop's behavior, after all iterations, `permutation` will have its elements at multiples of `k` filled up to the length of the list, following the described increment pattern.
- Therefore, `curr_v` will be `len(permutation) + 7`, and `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be equal to `len(permutation)`, indicating that all relevant indices have been processed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
