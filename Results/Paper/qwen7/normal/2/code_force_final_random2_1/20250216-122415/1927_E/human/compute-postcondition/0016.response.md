Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is an even integer and `k` must be less than `n`, `2k < len(permutation)`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is updated with `curr_v`**

Explanation: The code updates the element in the `permutation` list at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` with the value `curr_v`. However, the specific value of `curr_v` is not provided, so we only know that the element at the specified index has been updated. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged, and the conditions related to `k` and `permutation` also remain valid.
