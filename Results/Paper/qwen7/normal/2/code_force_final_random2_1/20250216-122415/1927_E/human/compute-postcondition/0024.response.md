Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)`.

2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `k` is an even integer and `k` must be less than `n`
   - `permutation` is a list where the indices that are multiples of `k` are filled with consecutive integers starting from 2
   - `idx_v` is `len(permutation)`
   - `curr_v` is `len(permutation) + 1`
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 1

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `len(permutation)`.
   - Currently, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 1.
   - Therefore, `len(permutation)` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute the first time.

4. **Check the current state**:
   - `idx_v` is `len(permutation)`, which means `len(permutation)` is equal to `idx_v`.
   - `curr_v` is `len(permutation) + 1`, which means `curr_v` is one more than `len(permutation)`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 1, `len(permutation)` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute the first time.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `len(permutation)` must be at least 2.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 1, `k` is an even integer and `k` must be less than `n`, `permutation` is a list where the indices that are multiples of `k` are filled with consecutive integers starting from 2, `idx_v` is `len(permutation)`, `curr_v` is `len(permutation) + 1`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 1 and `len(permutation)` must be at least 2**
