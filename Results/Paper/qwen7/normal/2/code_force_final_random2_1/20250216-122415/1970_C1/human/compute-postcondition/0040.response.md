Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `tree` is a list containing the element `u`.**

The code `tree.append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the list `tree`. Since `u` is an input integer, it is added to the list. The values of `i`, `n`, and `v` remain unchanged.
