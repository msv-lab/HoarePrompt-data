Output State: **`tree` contains all the edges of the tree in the order they were added, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`, `moves` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the minimum of `min(t, idx)` and `min(t, n - idx - 1)`.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `moves` with two elements. Each element is the minimum of `t` (which is `idx` in this context) and either `idx` itself or `n - idx - 1`, where `n` is the length of the tree. Since `t` is `idx`, the list `moves` will contain `[idx, n - idx - 1]` or `[n - idx - 1, idx]`, depending on which value is smaller. The values of `tree` and `start` remain unchanged.
