Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = int(input().split())[0], `u` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u ≤ n, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, and the deque `tree` now contains `v` as its first element.**

Explanation: The code `tree.appendleft(v)` appends the value of `v` to the left end of the deque `tree`. Since `v` was previously within the range 1 ≤ v ≤ n and the deque was initially empty, after executing the code, `tree` now contains `v` as its first element. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
