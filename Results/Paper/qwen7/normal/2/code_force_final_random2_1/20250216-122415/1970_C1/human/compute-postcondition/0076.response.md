Output State: **`tree` contains all the edges of the tree in the order they were added, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`.**

Explanation: The code `idx = tree.index(start)` finds the index of the `start` element within the list `tree` and assigns it to the variable `idx`. The values of `tree` and `start` remain unchanged.
