Output State: **The deque `tree` contains all the edges of the tree in the order they were added.**

Natural Language Description: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the deque `tree` will contain all the edges of the tree in the order they were added during the loop's execution. The initial state of `empty` being `True` ensures that the first edge added to the tree will start populating the deque. Subsequent edges are added based on specific conditions involving the first and last elements of the deque, ensuring that the final structure of `tree` represents the sequence of edges as input throughout the loop's iterations.
