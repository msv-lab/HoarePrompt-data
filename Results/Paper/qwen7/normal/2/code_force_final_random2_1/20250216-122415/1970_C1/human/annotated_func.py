#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, t is an integer such that t = 1, u and v are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the tree has exactly two leaves. Additionally, the function takes no input arguments as defined, but the input is provided through standard input.
def func_1():
    n, t = map(int, input().split())
    tree = deque()
    empty = True
    for i in range(n - 1):
        u, v = map(int, input().split())
        
        if empty:
            tree.append(u)
            tree.append(v)
            empty = False
        elif v == tree[0]:
            tree.appendleft(u)
        elif v == tree[-1]:
            tree.append(u)
        elif u == tree[0]:
            tree.appendleft(v)
        elif u == tree[-1]:
            tree.append(v)
        
    #State: The deque `tree` contains all the edges of the tree in the order they were added.
    start = int(input())
    idx = tree.index(start)
    moves = [min(t, idx), min(t, n - idx - 1)]
    if any([(move % 2 == 1) for move in moves]) :
        print('Ron')
        #This is printed: Ron
    else :
        print('Hermione')
        #This is printed: Hermione
    #State: Postcondition: `tree` contains all the edges of the tree in the order they were added, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`, `moves` is a list containing two elements, both of which are the minimum of `min(t, idx)` and `min(t, n - idx - 1)`. If at least one of the moves in the `moves` list is an odd number, the postcondition remains as per the if part. If all elements in `moves` are even numbers, the postcondition remains as per the else part.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads the number of nodes \( n \) and an integer \( t \) from standard input, followed by pairs of nodes \( u \) and \( v \) representing edges in a tree with exactly two leaves. It constructs a deque representing the tree edges. Then, it reads a starting node \( start \) and calculates the minimum distances from \( start \) to the root in both directions. Depending on whether these distances are odd or even, it prints either 'Ron' or 'Hermione'.
