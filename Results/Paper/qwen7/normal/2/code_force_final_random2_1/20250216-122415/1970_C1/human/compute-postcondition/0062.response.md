Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `u` is the first input integer, `v` is the second input integer, `tree` is a deque with `u` as its first element, and `empty` is `False`**.

Explanation: The code `tree.appendleft(u)` appends the value of `u` to the left of the deque `tree`. Given the initial conditions, if `empty` was `False`, `tree` already contained the elements `u` and `v` (in that order). After appending `u` to the left, `tree` now contains `[u, u, v]` if `u` was already present, or `[u, v]` if `u` was not initially part of `tree`. However, since `u` is appended to the left, the new state of `tree` will have `u` as its first element, and `empty` remains `False` because `tree` still contains more than one element.
