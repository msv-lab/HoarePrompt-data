Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, and `tree` is a list or deque with the element `v` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `tree.append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the existing `tree`. Since `tree` was initially either a list or deque with one or two elements, and considering the conditions given, after appending `v`, `tree` will now contain more elements. The values of `i`, `n`, `u`, and the condition for `empty` remain unchanged.
