Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = int(input().split())[0], `u` is appended to the deque `tree`, `v` is equal to `tree[-1]`, and the deque `tree` is no longer empty.**

Explanation: The code `tree.append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the deque `tree`. Since `v` was previously equal to `tree[-1]`, after appending `u`, `v` will now also be equal to `u`. The values of `i`, `n`, `t`, and the condition for `u` and `v` remain unchanged, but now `tree` is no longer empty.
