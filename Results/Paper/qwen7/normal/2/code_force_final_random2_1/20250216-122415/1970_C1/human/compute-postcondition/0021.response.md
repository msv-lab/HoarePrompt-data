Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = int(input().split())[0], `u` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u ≤ n, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, and the tree is represented by an empty deque `tree`. Additionally, `v` is not equal to `tree[-1]`, `u` is equal to `tree[0]`, and the deque `tree` remains empty.
