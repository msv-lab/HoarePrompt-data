Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = int(input().split())[0], `u` is appended to the deque `tree`, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, and the deque `tree` now contains the elements `u` and `v`.**

Explanation: The code `tree.append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the deque `tree`. Since `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, and `u` was already in the deque `tree`, the deque `tree` now contains both `u` and `v`. All other variables remain unchanged.
