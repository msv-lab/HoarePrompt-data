Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, and `tree` is either a list or a deque with one or two elements. If `empty` is `False`, then `tree` is a list containing the elements `u` and `v`. If `empty` is `True`, then `tree` is a list or deque with one element, and if `v` is equal to the first element of `tree`, `u` is appended to the left of `tree`; otherwise, `tree` becomes a list or deque with one element `v`.
