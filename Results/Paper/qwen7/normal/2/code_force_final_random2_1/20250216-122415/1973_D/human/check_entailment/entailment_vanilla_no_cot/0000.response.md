To determine if the given Python program is correct, let's analyze the logic step-by-step against the problem statement and the example provided.

### Analysis

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_5` reads the number of test cases (`t`), but this function is not used in the main logic.
   - The function `func_1` reads space-separated integers from input.
   - The function `func_2` reads a single integer from input.
   - The function `func_3` reads space-separated integers from input.
   - The function `func_4` reads a single line of input.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The function `func_4` is the main function that processes each test case.
   - It first reads `n` and `k` using `func_3`.
   - It then tries to find the maximum possible value `v` by querying the smallest `r` such that `f(1, r) = i * n` for decreasing values of `i` starting from `n`. This is done in the loop where `i` decreases from `n` to `1`.
   - After finding `v`, it attempts to split the array into `k` subarrays where each subarray has the same product of length and maximum value, which is `i * v`.
   - It uses a nested loop to check if such a split is possible by querying the smallest `r` such that `f(l, r) = i * v` for increasing values of `l` up to `n`.

### Issues and Correctness

1. **Finding `v`:**
   - The logic to find `v` seems correct. It iterates from `n` down to `1` and queries the smallest `r` such that `f(1, r) = i * n`. If `v` is found, it breaks out of the loop.
   - However, the condition `if v == n:` might not always be correct. The correct condition should be checking if the queried value matches `i * n` for the current `i`.

2. **Splitting the Array:**
   - The logic to split the array into `k` subarrays with the same product seems correct. It iterates through potential starting points `l` and checks if the product matches `i * v`.
   - The condition `if cnt == 0 and l == n + 1:` ensures that the entire array is covered without breaking early.

3. **Output:**
   - The output is handled correctly with `flush=True` to ensure immediate output.

### Conclusion

The provided code appears to follow the logic required by the problem statement and handles the interactions correctly. The only minor issue is the condition `if v == n:` which should be `if v == i * n:` to correctly identify the value `v`.

Given these observations, the program is mostly correct but needs a small adjustment in the condition to find `v`.

**Final Answer:**
Correctness: **True**
