Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `cnt and l < n + 1`.

2. **Current states before the loop**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is 1
   - `k` must be 1 (this variable is not part of the loop condition)
   - `cnt` is 1
   - `l` is `func_2()` + 1
   - The condition `(cnt != 0 or l != n + 1)` holds true.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - `cnt` must be non-zero for the loop to execute.
   - `l` must be less than `n + 1` for the loop to execute.

4. **Check the current values**:
   - `cnt` is currently 1, which is non-zero. This part of the condition is already satisfied.
   - `n` is 1, so `n + 1` is 2.
   - `l` is `func_2()` + 1. For `l` to be less than `n + 1`, `l` must be less than 2. Since `l` is `func_2()` + 1, `func_2()` must return a value such that `l` is less than 2.

5. **Determine necessary adjustments**:
   - The only variables involved in the loop condition are `cnt` and `l`.
   - `cnt` is already non-zero.
   - `l` must be less than 2.

Given these points, the only state that needs adjustment is `l` to ensure it is less than 2.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 1, `k` must be 1, `cnt` is 1, `l` is `func_2()` + 1 and `l` must be less than 2**
