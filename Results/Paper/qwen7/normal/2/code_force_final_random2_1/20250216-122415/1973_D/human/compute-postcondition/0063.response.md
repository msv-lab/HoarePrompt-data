Output State: `i` is 2, `n` is 1, `k` must be 1, `cnt` is non-zero-1, `l` is `func_2()` + 1.

Natural Language Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `i` remains 2, `n` remains 1, and `k` must be 1. The variable `cnt` will be non-zero-1 (a value less than or equal to 0) since it is decremented by 1 each time the loop runs and eventually becomes 0 or a negative number. The variable `l` will be `func_2()` + 1 because it is incremented by 1 each time the loop runs, starting from `func_2()` + 1.
