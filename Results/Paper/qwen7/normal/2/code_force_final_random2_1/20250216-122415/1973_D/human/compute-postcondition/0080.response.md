Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is 1.
   - `k` must be 1.
   - `cnt` must be at least 1.
   - `l` must be less than 2.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `l` must be less than 2. Since `l` is not explicitly defined but must be less than 2, it could be any value such as 0 or 1.
- `v` is not mentioned in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value directly. However, since `i * v` is part of the print statement, we need to consider what `v` might be. If `v` were also defined elsewhere in the code, it would be used here. But without further context, we can only express `i * v` in terms of `v`.

Given these points, the print statement will output a formatted string with `l` and `i * v`. Since `l` must be less than 2, and `i` is 2, `i * v` will be `2 * v`.

Therefore, the output will be a string in the format `? l (2 * v)` where `l` is a value less than 2 and `2 * v` is the product of 2 and `v`.

Output: **? [l] 2 * v (where l is a value less than 2 and v is an unknown value)**
