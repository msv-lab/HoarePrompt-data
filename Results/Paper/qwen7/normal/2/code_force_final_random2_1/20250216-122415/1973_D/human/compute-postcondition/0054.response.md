Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `cnt and l < n + 1`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is 1
   - `k` must be 1 (though this is not relevant to the loop condition)
   - `cnt` is 0
   - `l` is `func_2()` + 1

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - `cnt` must be non-zero for the condition to be true.
   - `l` must be less than `n + 1`.

4. **Current values**:
   - `cnt` is 0, which means the first part of the condition (`cnt`) is false.
   - `l` is `func_2()` + 1, and since `n` is 1, `l` must be less than 2 for the second part of the condition to be true.

5. **Adjusting the state**:
   - Since `cnt` is 0, it cannot be made non-zero without changing its value.
   - To make the loop execute one more time, `cnt` must be non-zero. Therefore, we need to set `cnt` to a non-zero value.
   - The value of `l` should be adjusted to be less than `n + 1`, but since `n` is 1, `l` must be less than 2. Given that `l` is `func_2()` + 1, we need to ensure `func_2()` returns a value such that `l` is less than 2.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `cnt` and `l`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 1, `k` must be 1, `cnt` must be non-zero, `l` must be less than 2**
