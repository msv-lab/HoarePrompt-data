Output State: **`v` is 1, `n` is the return value of `func_3()`, and `k` is the return value of `func_3()`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value 1 to the variable `v`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are the return values of `func_3()`. Since no further operations are performed on `n` and `k`, their values stay as they were after calling `func_3()`.
