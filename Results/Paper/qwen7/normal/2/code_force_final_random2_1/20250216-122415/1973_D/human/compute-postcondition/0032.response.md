Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `cnt and l < n + 1`.
2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is 1
   - `k` must be 1 (though this variable is not part of the loop condition)
   - `cnt` is 0
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1`

3. **Analyze the Loop Condition**:
   - For the loop to continue, two conditions must be met:
     1. `cnt` must be truthy (non-zero).
     2. `l < n + 1`.

4. **Evaluate Current Values**:
   - `cnt` is 0, which means the first condition (`cnt`) is not met. Therefore, the loop will not execute again because `cnt` is not truthy.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `cnt` is 0, it cannot be adjusted to make the loop execute again because it would need to be non-zero.
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1`. We don't know the exact value of `func_2()`, but we need to ensure that `l` is such that `l < n + 1` is true. Given that `n` is 1, `l` must be less than 2. However, since `cnt` is 0, the loop will not run regardless of the value of `l`.

Since the loop will not execute again due to `cnt` being 0, no adjustments are necessary to make the loop execute one more time.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 1, `k` must be 1, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2() + 1`**
