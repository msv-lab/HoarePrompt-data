Output State: **The program returns None**

Given the initial state and the code snippet, here's the breakdown:

- `i` is 2
- `n` is 1
- `k` must be 1
- `cnt` is 0
- `l` is `func_2()` + 1
- The condition `cnt == 0 and l == n + 1` is true

The code snippet simply returns without any value. In Python, when a function does not explicitly return a value, it returns `None` by default. Therefore, the program returns `None`.
