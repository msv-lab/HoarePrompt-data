Output State: **`v` is `i`, `n` must be at least 1, `k` is the return value of `func_3()`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `v`, `n`, or `k`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it was in. Therefore, the values of `v` and `i` remain the same, `n` must still be at least 1, and `k` retains its value as the return value of `func_3()`.
