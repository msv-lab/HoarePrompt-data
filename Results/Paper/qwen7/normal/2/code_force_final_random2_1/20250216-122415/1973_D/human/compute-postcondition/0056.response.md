Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 1, `k` must be 1, `cnt` must be non-zero, `l` is `func_2()` + 1**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `l` by adding 1 to the result of the function call `func_2()`. The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, and `cnt` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
