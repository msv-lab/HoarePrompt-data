Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `cnt and l < n + 1`.

2. **Analyze each part of the loop condition**:
   - `cnt`: For the loop to execute, `cnt` must be non-zero (i.e., `cnt != 0`).
   - `l < n + 1`: For the loop to execute, `l` must be less than `n + 1`.

3. **Current values**:
   - `i` is 2 (not relevant to the loop condition)
   - `n` is 1 (not directly relevant to the loop condition but used in `l < n + 1`)
   - `k` must be 1 (not relevant to the loop condition)
   - `cnt` is 1 (already non-zero, so no adjustment needed)
   - `l` is 2

4. **Check the loop condition with current values**:
   - `cnt` is 1 (non-zero), so `cnt` condition is satisfied.
   - `l` is 2, and `n + 1` is `1 + 1 = 2`, so `l < n + 1` is `2 < 2`, which is false.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `l` is currently 2 and `n + 1` is 2, `l` must be less than `n + 1` for the loop to execute. Therefore, `l` needs to be adjusted to be less than 2.

Given the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `l`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 1, `k` must be 1, `cnt` is 1, `l` must be less than 2**
