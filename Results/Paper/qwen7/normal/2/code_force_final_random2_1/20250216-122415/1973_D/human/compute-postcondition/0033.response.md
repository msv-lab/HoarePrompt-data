Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is 1.
   - `k` must be 1 (though it's not used in the print statement).
   - `cnt` is 0.
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1`.

2. **Understanding `func_2()`**:
   - Since `func_2()` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact return value. However, we know that `l` is `func_2() + 1`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)`.
   - Here, `v` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value directly. However, since `i` is 1, `i * v` will be `v` if `v` is defined, or it will be 0 if `v` is undefined or zero.

Given the above breakdown, let's assume `v` is defined but its value is unknown. The most precise description we can give is:

Output: **'? [func_2() + 1] [v]'** (where `[func_2() + 1]` is the value of `l` and `[v]` is the value of `v`).
