Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 1, `k` must be 1, `cnt` is -1, `l` is `func_2() + 1`**

Explanation: The variable `cnt` is decremented by 1. Initially, `cnt` is 0, so after executing `cnt -= 1`, `cnt` becomes -1. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, and `l`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
