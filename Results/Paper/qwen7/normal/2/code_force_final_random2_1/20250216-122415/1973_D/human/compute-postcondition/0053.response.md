Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `cnt and l < n + 1`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is 1
   - `k` must be 1 (this state is not part of the loop head)
   - `cnt` is 0
   - `l` is `func_2()` + 1

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - `cnt` must be non-zero for the condition to be true.
   - `l` must be less than `n + 1`.

4. **Current values**:
   - `cnt` is 0, which means the first part of the condition (`cnt`) is false.
   - `l` is `func_2()` + 1, and since `n` is 1, `l` must be less than 2 for the second part of the condition to be true.

5. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - Since `cnt` is 0, it cannot be adjusted directly because it is already false.
   - For `l` to be less than `n + 1`, `l` must be less than 2. However, since `l` is `func_2()` + 1, `func_2()` must return a value such that `l` is less than 2. This implies `func_2()` must return 0 or -1 (or any value that makes `l` less than 2).

Given these conditions, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `l` to ensure the loop can execute one more time. Specifically, `l` must be less than 2.

Therefore, the modified state should be:

**State: `i` is 2, `n` is 1, `k` must be 1, `cnt` is 0, `l` must be less than 2**
