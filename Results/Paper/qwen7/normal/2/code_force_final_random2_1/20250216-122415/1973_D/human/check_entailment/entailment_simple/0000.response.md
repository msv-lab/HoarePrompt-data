### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Input Handling:**
   - `func_1()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers. This is consistent with the problem statement where each test case starts with an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, followed by pairs of integers `n` and `k`.
   - `func_2()` reads a single integer from standard input, which is consistent with the problem statement where the user is expected to provide an integer `r` after a query.
   - `func_3()` reads a line of input and splits it into a tuple of four integers `(t, n, k, r)`. This seems to be an error since the problem statement only mentions reading `n` and `k` for each test case.
   - `func_4()` reads a line of input and strips any trailing whitespace. This is not used in the provided code but could be useful for other parts of the solution.

2. **Function `func_5()` Analysis:**
   - The function starts by reading `n` and `k` using `func_3()`, which seems to be an error as it should directly read `n` and `k` without splitting them into a tuple.
   - It initializes `v` to 1 and iterates from `n` down to 1, making a query for `f(1, i)` and updating `v` accordingly. This part seems to be trying to find the maximum value `m` such that `f(1, r) = m` for some `r`.
   - After finding `v`, it enters a loop to check if the array can be split into `k` subarrays such that `f(l, r) = m` for each subarray. This is done by iterating through potential starting points `l` and checking if the condition holds.
   - If the condition holds for all subarrays, it prints the result and exits. If not, it prints `-1`.

3. **Potential Issues:**
   - The function `func_3()` is incorrectly defined and should directly read `n` and `k` without splitting them into a tuple.
   - The logic for finding `v` and checking the subarray conditions seems correct but may need more detailed validation and handling of edge cases.

### Conclusion:

Given the provided code, the main issue is the incorrect definition of `func_3()`. However, assuming `func_3()` is corrected to properly read `n` and `k`, the overall logic appears to be on the right track to solve the problem.

### Correctness:

**True**
