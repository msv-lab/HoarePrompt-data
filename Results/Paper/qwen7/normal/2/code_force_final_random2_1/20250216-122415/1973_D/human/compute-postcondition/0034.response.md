Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 1, `k` must be 1, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`**

Explanation: The code `l = func_2() + 1` assigns the value of `func_2() + 1` to the variable `l`. Since `func_2()` is called again, the value of `l` remains as `func_2() + 1`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, and `cnt`) are not affected by this line of code.
