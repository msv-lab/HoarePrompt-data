Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 1, `k` must be 1, `cnt` must be greater than 0, `l` is `func_2()` + 1**

Explanation: The variable `l` is assigned the value of `func_2()` plus 1. Since `func_2()` is not defined, its value remains unknown. However, we know that `l` must now be one more than whatever `func_2()` returns. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
