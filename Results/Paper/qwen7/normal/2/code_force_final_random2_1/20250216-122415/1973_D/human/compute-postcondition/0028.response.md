Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `cnt and l < n + 1`.

2. **Analyze each part of the loop condition**:
   - `cnt`: For the loop to execute, `cnt` must be non-zero (i.e., `cnt != 0`).
   - `l < n + 1`: Given `l` is 1 and `n` is 1, this condition becomes `1 < 1 + 1`, which simplifies to `1 < 2`, which is always true.

3. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is 1.
   - `k` must be 1 or less than 1.
   - `cnt` is `k`.
   - `l` is 1.

4. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - Since `l < n + 1` is always true, we don't need to adjust any state related to `l` or `n`.
   - We need to ensure `cnt` is non-zero. Given `cnt` is `k`, and `k` must be 1 or less than 1, we need to make sure `k` is 1 to make `cnt` non-zero.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `k` to ensure `cnt` is non-zero.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 1, `k` must be 1, `cnt` is `k`, `l` is 1**
