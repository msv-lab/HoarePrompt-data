Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 1, `k` must be 1, `cnt` is 1, `l` is `func_2()` + 1, and the condition `(cnt != 0 or l != n + 1)` holds true.**

Explanation: The code `cnt, l = k, 1` updates the values of `cnt` and `l`. Specifically, `cnt` is assigned the value of `k`, which is 1, and `l` is assigned the value of `1`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, and the condition) remain unchanged. The condition `(cnt != 0 or l != n + 1)` also remains true since `cnt` is now 1 (not 0) and `l` is `func_2()` + 1 (not equal to `n + 1` which is 2).
