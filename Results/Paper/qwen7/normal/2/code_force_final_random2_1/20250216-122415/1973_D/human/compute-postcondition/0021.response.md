Output State: **`v` is `n-2`, `n` must be at least 1, `k` is the return value of `func_3()`, `i` is `n-2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement. Since no variables are reassigned or modified by the `break` statement, their previous values remain unchanged.
