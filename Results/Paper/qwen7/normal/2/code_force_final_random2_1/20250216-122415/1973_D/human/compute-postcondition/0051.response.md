Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 1, `k` must be 1, `cnt` is 1, `l` is `func_2()` + 1**

Explanation: The code `l = func_2() + 1` assigns the value of `func_2() + 1` to the variable `l`. Since `func_2()` is not defined in the provided code, its exact value is unknown. However, we know that `l` must be less than 2 before the code was executed, and now it is `func_2() + 1`. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `l` which is `func_2() + 1`. All other variables retain their original values.
