Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is given as:
   ```
   while cnt and l < n + 1:
   ```

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is 1
   - `k` must be 1 (This state is not part of the loop head)
   - `cnt` is non-zero-1 (This means `cnt` is a non-zero integer, but we need to know the exact value)
   - `l` is `func_2()` + 1 (We need to know the return value of `func_2()`)

3. **Determine the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The variables in the loop head are `cnt` and `l`.

4. **Loop Execution Condition:**
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions must be true:
     - `cnt` must be non-zero (i.e., `cnt != 0`)
     - `l < n + 1` must be true

5. **Current Values:**
   - `n` is 1, so `n + 1` is 2.
   - `l` is `func_2()` + 1, so for `l < n + 1` to be true, `func_2()` must return a value such that `func_2() + 1 < 2`.

6. **Possible Values for `func_2()` and `cnt`:**
   - Since `l` must be less than 2, `func_2()` must return 0 (because `0 + 1 = 1` and `1 < 2`).
   - `cnt` must be non-zero (non-zero-1).

7. **Adjusting the States:**
   - We need to ensure `l` is less than 2, which means `func_2()` must return 0.
   - We need to ensure `cnt` is non-zero.

### Final State Adjustment:

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `func_2()` and `cnt`.

**State:**
- `i` is 2
- `n` is 1
- `k` must be 1 (unchanged)
- `cnt` must be non-zero (non-zero-1)
- `l` must be less than 2 (which means `func_2()` must return 0)

So, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 1, `k` must be 1, `cnt` must be non-zero, `l` must be less than 2**
