Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `cnt and l < n + 1`.
2. **Current values at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is 1
   - `k` must be 1 (though this is not part of the loop head, so it doesn't affect the loop condition)
   - `cnt` is -1
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1`

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - `cnt` must be non-zero for the condition to be true.
   - `l` must be less than `n + 1`.

4. **Current values**:
   - `cnt` is -1, which means the first part of the condition (`cnt`) is false because `-1` is not non-zero.
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1`. Without knowing the exact value returned by `func_2()`, we cannot determine if `l` is less than `n + 1` (which is 2).

5. **Adjusting the states**:
   - Since `cnt` is -1, we need to change `cnt` to a non-zero value to satisfy the condition.
   - We don't need to change `l` because the loop condition depends on `cnt` being non-zero first.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `cnt`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is 1, `k` must be 1, `cnt` must be non-zero, `l` is `func_2() + 1`**
