Reasoning:

1. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: Reads a list of test cases, each containing `n` and `k`.
   - **func_2**: Reads an integer input from the user.
   - **func_3**: Reads and returns a tuple of four integers `(t, n, k, r)`.
   - **func_4**: Reads a string input from the user and returns it after stripping any trailing whitespace.
   - **func_5**: Implements the main logic to find the largest `m` that meets the criteria specified in the problem statement.

2. **Main Logic in `func_5`**:
   - The function first determines the maximum possible value `v` by querying the maximum product for the entire array.
   - Then, it tries to split the array into `k` subarrays such that each subarray has the same product `i * v`.
   - It uses a nested loop to check if such a split is possible by querying the minimum `r` for each segment.
   - If a valid split is found, it prints the product `i * v` and returns.
   - If no valid split is found, it prints `-1`.

3. **Verification**:
   - The function correctly handles the input and output as per the problem statement.
   - It uses the correct logic to find the largest `m` that can be split into `k` subarrays.
   - The function makes sure to terminate early if a valid split is found, which is efficient.
   - The function also correctly handles the case where no valid split exists by printing `-1`.

Given the analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
