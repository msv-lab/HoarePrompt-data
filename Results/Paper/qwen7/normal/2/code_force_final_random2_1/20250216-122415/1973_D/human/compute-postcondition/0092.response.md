Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is 1, `k` must be 1, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2() + 1`**.

The function `func_2()` is called but its return value is not explicitly captured or used in any assignment, so the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The only impact is that `func_2()` might have side effects, but since no such side effects are mentioned, we assume no change in the values of the variables.
