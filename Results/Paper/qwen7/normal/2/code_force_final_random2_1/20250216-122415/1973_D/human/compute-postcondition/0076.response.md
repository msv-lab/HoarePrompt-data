Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 2
- `n` is 1
- `k` must be 1
- `cnt` must be greater than 0
- `l` must be less than 2

We need to determine the values of the variables used in the `print` statement. The statement is:

```python
print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is 2
- `l` must be less than 2, so the possible values for `l` could be 0 or 1 (since it's an integer and must be less than 2).

However, the value of `v` is not explicitly provided. Since `v` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its value precisely. Therefore, we will leave it as `v`.

Given this information, the print statement will output a string with the values of `l` and `i * v`.

Output: **? [l] 2*v** (where `[l]` is either 0 or 1, and `v` is an unknown value)
