You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and two binary strings a_{11}a_{12}…a_{1n} and a_{21}a_{22}…a_{2n} are given, where each a_{ij} is either 0 or 1. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
        
    #State: The list `a` contains three elements, where the first element is the original input from the user, the second element is the new input from the user, and the third element is the input received from the input() function.
    s = []
    x = 0
    y = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1':
            y = i
        
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `x` is 2, `y` is 2, `a` contains three elements, `s` is ['0', '1'], `i` is 2.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-2`. Given the conditions in the loop, `x` is set to `i` when `a[0][i+1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0'. The last iteration sets `x` to `2` and `y` to `2` since `a[0][3]` (which would be `a[0][2+1]`) is not specified but follows the pattern where `a[1][2]` is '0'. The list `s` remains unchanged as it was set to ['0', '1'] in the second iteration and no further changes were made to it.
    t = 1
    for i in range(y, x):
        if a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
        
    #State: `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `i` is 1, `t` is 2, `a` is a list of lists where the second sublist has at least `x` elements, `s` is a string.
    print(s, sep='')
    #This is printed: s
    print(t)
    #This is printed: 2
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases internally. For each test case, it accepts an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), and two binary strings a_{1} and a_{2} of length n, where each character in the strings is either '0' or '1'. It returns a result based on the comparison of the two binary strings for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
