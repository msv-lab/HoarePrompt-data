Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list containing three elements where the first element is the original string representation of an integer, the second element is the new integer input as a string, and the third element is the new integer input as a string.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(input())` appends the input value to the list `a`. Initially, `a` contains two elements: the original string representation of an integer and the new integer input as a string. After executing the code, `a` now contains three elements: the original string, the new integer input as a string (which was already in `a`), and the new integer input as a string (which is appended now). The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
