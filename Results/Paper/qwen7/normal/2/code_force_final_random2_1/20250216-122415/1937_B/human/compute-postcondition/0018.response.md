Postcondition: `a` is a list of lists where the first sublist has at least one element at index `i + 1` equal to '1' and the second sublist has an element at index `i` equal to '0'; `s` is a list that starts with the elements from the first sublist of `a` up to the element at index `i + 1`, followed by the element from the second sublist of `a` at index `i`; `x` is equal to `i`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
