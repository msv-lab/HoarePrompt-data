Postcondition: `i` is 0, `x` is initialized to a value that satisfies the condition or `n - 1` if the condition is never met, `a` is a list of integers, the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `s`, and `t` is `x - i + 1`. If the condition `a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
