### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1()` correctly reads the number of columns `n` and the two binary strings representing the grid.
   - The state after reading these inputs is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Finding the Lexicographically Smallest Path**:
   - The code attempts to construct the lexicographically smallest path by checking if the current cell in the first row (`a[0]`) can transition to the next cell in the second row (`a[1]`) under the given conditions.
   - However, the logic for constructing the path `s` is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':` is not sufficient to ensure the lexicographically smallest path. This condition checks if the current cell in the first row is '1' and the previous cell in the second row is '0', which does not guarantee the smallest path.

3. **Counting Paths**:
   - The variable `x` is used to store the index where the condition was last met, but the subsequent logic for counting paths is also incorrect. The loop that updates `t` does not properly count the number of valid paths.

4. **Output**:
   - The output is printed using `print(s, sep='')` and `print(t)`, which does not match the expected format of printing the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths yielding this string.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues in the logic for constructing the lexicographically smallest path and counting the number of such paths, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

### Correctness:
**False**
