Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the integer input by the user, `a` is a list containing three strings representing integers, with each string being the input provided during each iteration of the loop, `s` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
        s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
        x = i
        break
else:
    s = a[0] + a[1][n - 1]
    x = n - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a` is a list of lists where the first sublist has at least one element at index `i + 1` equal to '1' and the second sublist has an element at index `i` equal to '0'; `s` is a list that starts with the elements from the first sublist of `a` up to the element at index `i + 1`, followed by the element from the second sublist of `a` at index `i`; `x` is equal to `i`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list of lists where the first sublist has at least one element at index `i + 2` equal to '1' and the second sublist has an element at index `i + 1` equal to '0'; `s` includes the elements from the first sublist of `a` up to the element at index `i + 1`, followed by the element from the second sublist of `a` at index `i`; `x` is equal to `i + 1`, and if `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `a` is a list of lists where the first sublist has at least one element at index `i + 3` equal to '1' and the second sublist has an element at index `i` equal to '0'; `s` includes elements from the first sublist of `a` up to the element at index `i + 1`, followed by the element from the second sublist of `a` at index `i`; `x` is equal to `i + 1` if `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'`, otherwise `x` remains equal to `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
