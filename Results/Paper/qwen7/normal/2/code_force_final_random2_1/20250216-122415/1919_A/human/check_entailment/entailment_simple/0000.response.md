Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the winner based on the parity (even or odd) of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
2. The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and iterates through each test case.
3. For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets (`a` and `b`).
4. It then checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd using `abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`.
5. If the absolute difference is even, it prints "Bob". If the absolute difference is odd, it prints "Alice".
6. The logic in the program matches the problem statement perfectly. The program does not contain any logical errors or omissions that would affect its correctness.

Correctness: **True**
