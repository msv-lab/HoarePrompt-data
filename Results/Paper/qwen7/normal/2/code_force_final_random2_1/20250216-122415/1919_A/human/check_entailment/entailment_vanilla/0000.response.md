Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `a` and `b` for each case.

2. **Winning Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even using the condition `if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints "Bob".
   - Otherwise, it prints "Alice".

3. **Game Logic:**
   - The key observation here is that the game essentially boils down to determining who will be the last player to make a move.
   - If the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even, then Bob can always mirror Alice's moves to ensure he is the one to make the last move.
   - Conversely, if the absolute difference is odd, Alice can always make a move that leaves an even difference, ensuring she is the one to make the last move.

### Verification

Given the problem statement and the analysis of the game logic, the provided program correctly implements the solution. The logic is sound and matches the winning conditions derived from the game rules.

### Conclusion

The program correctly determines the winner based on the given problem description and the optimal strategy.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
