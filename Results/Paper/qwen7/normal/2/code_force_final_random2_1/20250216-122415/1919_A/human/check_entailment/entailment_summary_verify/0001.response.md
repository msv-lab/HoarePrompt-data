### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the key logic of the game and the winning conditions. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the values of `a` and `b`.

2. **Winning Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even using the condition `if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints "Bob".
   - Otherwise, it prints "Alice".

3. **Game Logic:**
   - The game involves alternating moves where each player can either swap wallets or remove a coin from their own wallet.
   - The key insight is that if the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves to ensure he is the one to make the last move.
   - Conversely, if the absolute difference is odd, Alice can always make a move that leaves an even difference, ensuring she is the one to make the last move.

4. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
   - The condition `abs(a - b) % 2 == 0` accurately determines whether the absolute difference is even or odd.
   - Based on this condition, the program prints the correct winner for each test case.

5. **Function Summary:**
   - The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` and two positive integers `a` and `b`.
   - It determines whether the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd and prints either "Bob" or "Alice" accordingly.
   - The function does not return any value, which is consistent with the problem requirements.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic and produces the expected output based on the problem description and the optimal strategy.
