Output State: `t` must be a positive integer less than or equal to 1000, `i` is equal to `t-1`, `a` and `b` are positive integers with values read from the input for each iteration of the loop. The values of `a` and `b` do not change unless the input provided changes them, and the loop prints either "Bob" or "Alice" based on whether the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd respectively, for each iteration.
