Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner based on the optimal strategy. The logic `if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0` is incorrect for this problem. 

To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the parity (odd or even nature) of the sum of the coins in both wallets. Hereâ€™s the correct approach:

- If the sum of the coins in both wallets (a + b) is even, then Bob wins because he can always force the game into a state where the sum remains even after his turn.
- If the sum of the coins in both wallets (a + b) is odd, then Alice wins because she can always force the game into a state where the sum becomes even after her turn.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

This logic ensures that the correct winner is determined based on the parity of the total number of coins in both wallets.
