Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, the postcondition remains unchanged from the if part. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd, the postcondition also remains unchanged from the else part.
