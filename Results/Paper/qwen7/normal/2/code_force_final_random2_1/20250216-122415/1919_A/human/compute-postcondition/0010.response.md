Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `t`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `t`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is an input integer.
   - The postcondition depends on the absolute difference between `a` and `b`:
     - If the absolute difference is even, the postcondition remains unchanged from the if part.
     - If the absolute difference is odd, the postcondition remains unchanged from the else part.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - The value of `t` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same.
   - The values of `a` and `b` do not change within the loop, so they remain the same.
   - The postcondition based on the absolute difference between `a` and `b` remains unchanged.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `t` remains the same and must still be greater than 0.
   - `a` and `b` remain the same.
   - The postcondition remains the same based on the absolute difference between `a` and `b`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and the postcondition remains unchanged based on the absolute difference between `a` and `b`**.
