You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be a positive integer less than or equal to 1000, `i` is equal to `t-1`, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ 10^9. The values of `a` and `b` are the last integers read from input during the loop's execution. For each iteration of the loop, if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, the output was "Bob". If the absolute difference is odd, the output was "Alice". The variable `t` remains unchanged throughout the loop's execution, and `i` increments by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `t-1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and two positive integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it returns a specific value based on the relationship between `a`, `b`, and `t`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
