Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer read from input, `b` is an integer read from input. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, no changes are made to `t`, `i`, `a`, and `b`. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd, no changes are made to `t`, `i`, `a`, and `b`.**
