Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer read from input, `b` is an integer read from input. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd, the postcondition also remains the same as the precondition.
