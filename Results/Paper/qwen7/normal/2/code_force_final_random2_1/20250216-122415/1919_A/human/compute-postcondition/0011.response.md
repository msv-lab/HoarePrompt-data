Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and `a` and `b` are updated to the integers read from input.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers separated by a space from the input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The preconditions that `t` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 1 are still valid. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the integers read from the input.
