Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer, `r` equals '>', `prev` is equal to `n-1`, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0.**

The code assigns the value `0` to the variable `v1`. Since `v1` was not previously defined, it is initialized to `0`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
