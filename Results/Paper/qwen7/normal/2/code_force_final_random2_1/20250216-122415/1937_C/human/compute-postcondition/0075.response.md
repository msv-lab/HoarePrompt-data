Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `i + 1`: This means `i` is incremented by 1.
- `prev` is `n-1`: This means `prev` is the value of `n` minus 1.
- `n` is an input integer: The value of `n` is unknown but it is an integer.
- `r` is the string "<": This is a string with a single character "<".
- `g` is 0: This is an integer with a value of 0.
- `kp` is 1: This is an integer with a value of 1.
- `v1` is `i + 1`: This means `v1` is the value of `i` plus 1.
- `v2` is `i`: This means `v2` is the value of `i`.

Given these values, let's determine what will be printed:

1. `v1` is `i + 1`.
2. `v2` is `i`.

When the print statement `print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')` is executed, it will substitute the values of `v1` and `v2` into the formatted string.

So, the print statement will output:
```
'? i+1 i+1 i i'
```

Output: **'? i+1 i+1 i i'**
