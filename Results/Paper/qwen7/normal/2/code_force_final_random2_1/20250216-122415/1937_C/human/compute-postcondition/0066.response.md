Postcondition: `min_index` is the next element in `min_indices`, `i` is the next element in `min_indices`, `max_index` is the next element in `min_indices`, and `res` is the return value of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)`. If `i` equals `max_index`, we continue the loop. If `i` does not equal `max_index`, the condition is not checked, and the loop continues with the next elements.
