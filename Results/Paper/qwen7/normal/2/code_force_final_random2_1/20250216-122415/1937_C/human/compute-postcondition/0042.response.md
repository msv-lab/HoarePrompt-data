Output State: `min_indices` is a list that contains the index `i` for which `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returned '<'. If no such `i` exists within the range of `n`, then `min_indices` will contain the last index `n-1`.

In simpler terms, `min_indices` will hold the index `i` (within the range from 0 to `n-1`) where the comparison with `func_1` resulted in '<', or it will contain the last index `n-1` if no such `i` was found during the loop's execution.
