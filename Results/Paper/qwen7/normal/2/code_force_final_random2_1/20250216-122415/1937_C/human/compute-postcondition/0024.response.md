Output State: **`min_indices` is a list containing the value of `max_index`, `res` is the result of `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)`, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**.

Explanation: The code calls the function `func_1` with the arguments `max_index`, `min_indices[0]`, `max_index`, and `i`. Since `i` is 0, `min_indices[0]` is `max_index`, and `n` is greater than 0, the function `func_1` is called with these values. The result of this function call is stored in the variable `res`. The values of `min_indices`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
