Output State: **`res` is the result of calling `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i + 1)`, `max_index` is `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The line `max_index = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is `i + 1`) to `max_index`. The values of `res` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
