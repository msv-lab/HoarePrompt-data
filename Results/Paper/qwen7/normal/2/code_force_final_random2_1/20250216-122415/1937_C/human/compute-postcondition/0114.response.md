Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The loop is defined as `for kp in range(int(input())):`.
- At the end of the previous iteration:
  - `i` will be equal to `n`.
  - `n` must be greater than 1.
  - `r` equals '>'.
  - `prev` will be equal to `n-1`.

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The only variable in the loop head is `kp`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop runs based on the value of `int(input())`. This means the loop will run until `kp` is less than `int(input())`.
3. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `r` is '>'.
   - `prev` is `n-1`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Determine the Value of `int(input())`**: Since `i` is equal to `n` at the end of the previous iteration, and `n` is greater than 1, the input value must be such that it allows the loop to continue or stop.
2. **Adjust `kp`**: For the loop to execute one more time, `kp` must be less than the input value. Since `i` is equal to `n` at the end of the previous iteration, `kp` must be `n` (since `i` is `n`).
3. **Adjust `n`**: To allow the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than 1, but since `kp` is `n`, `n` must be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
4. **Adjust `prev`**: `prev` should be updated to `n-1` for the next iteration, which is `n-1` since `n` is incremented by 1.

### Final State:
- `i` will be equal to `n`.
- `n` must be greater than 1 and incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
- `r` remains '>'.
- `prev` will be equal to `n-1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 2, `r` equals '>', `prev` is equal to `n-1`**.
