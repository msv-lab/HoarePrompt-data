Output State: **`i` is assigned the value of `prev`, which is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string from the user, `v1` remains unchanged as `n-1`, and `prev` is 1.**

The code `prev = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is 1) to the variable `prev`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
