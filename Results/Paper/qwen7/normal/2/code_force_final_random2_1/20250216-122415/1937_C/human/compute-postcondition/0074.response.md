Functionality: **The function processes an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) by calling `func_1` and `func_2`. It first determines a `max_index` based on the results of `func_1` calls, then constructs a list `min_indices` based on these results. Finally, it updates `min_index` based on the values in `min_indices` and calls `func_2` with `max_index` and `min_index` as arguments. The function does not return any value.**
