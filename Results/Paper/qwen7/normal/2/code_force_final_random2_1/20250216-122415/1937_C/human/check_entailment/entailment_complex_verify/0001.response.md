### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - We can query the result of \((p_a \mid p_b)\) vs \((p_c \mid p_d)\) up to \(3n\) times.
   - The goal is to find the pair with the maximum XOR value.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code defines three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`.
   - `func_1` is used to ask a query and get the result.
   - `func_2` is used to provide the final answer.
   - `func_3` is the main function that implements the logic to find the indices.

3. **Main Logic in `func_3`:**
   - For \(n = 2\), it directly outputs the indices \(0\) and \(1\).
   - For \(n > 2\):
     - It initializes `max_index` to \(0\) and finds the index with the highest bitwise OR value when paired with \(0\).
     - It then identifies the minimum index among those with the same OR value as `max_index`.
     - Finally, it determines the index with the highest XOR value when paired with `min_index`.

4. **Detailed Analysis of the Code:**
   - The logic to find `max_index` is correct. It ensures that `max_index` is the index with the highest OR value when paired with \(0\).
   - However, the logic to determine `min_indices` and `min_index` is flawed. The code assumes that the minimum OR value among the candidates will lead to the maximum XOR, which is not necessarily true. This is because the XOR value depends on both the OR value and the specific values of the indices involved.
   - The final step of determining `min_index` by comparing with `min_indices` also does not guarantee finding the optimal pair. The code does not consider the actual XOR values but only the OR values, which can lead to incorrect results.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - Consider a permutation like \([0, 1, 2, 3]\):
     - `max_index` will be \(3\) (since \(3 \mid 3 = 3\)).
     - `min_indices` will include indices \(0, 1, 2, 3\).
     - The final `min_index` might not be the correct choice for maximizing XOR. For example, if the permutation is \([0, 1, 2, 3]\), the maximum XOR is \(3 \oplus 1 = 2\), but the code might choose \(0 \oplus 3 = 3\) instead.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The logic in `func_3` does not guarantee finding the pair with the maximum XOR value due to the flawed approach in determining `min_index`.

### Correctness:
