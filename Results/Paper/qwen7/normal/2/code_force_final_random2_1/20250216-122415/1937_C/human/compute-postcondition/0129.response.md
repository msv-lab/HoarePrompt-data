Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 2
- `n` must be greater than 1 (though the value of `n` itself is not needed for this specific print statement)
- `v2` is 2

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

However, there is no definition for `v1` in the initial state. Since `v1` is not defined, it cannot be determined what value will be printed for `v1`.

Therefore, the output will include the placeholder for `v1` and the explicit value for `v2`.

Output: **? [v1] [v1] 2 2**
