### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly sends a query to the judge and waits for a response. The response is used to update the state of the program, specifically the `max_index` variable.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function correctly prints the result of the solution and flushes the output buffer. It does not return any value, which is expected since it is supposed to terminate the program after finding the optimal indices.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - **Initialization**: The function starts by reading `n` and checking if `n` is 2. If so, it directly calls `func_2` with indices 0 and 1, which is a valid solution for the smallest possible permutation.
   - **Finding `max_index`**: For `n > 2`, the function iterates through indices from 0 to `n-1` and uses `func_1` to compare `(p_0 | p_{max_index})` with `(p_0 | p_i)`. If the former is less than the latter, it updates `max_index` to `i`. This step ensures that `max_index` holds the index of the largest value in the permutation when considering the bitwise OR with `p_0`.
   - **Finding `min_indices`**: The function then iterates again to find the minimum index among those that have the same value as `max_index` when compared with `max_index` using `func_1`. This step ensures that `min_index` holds the index of the smallest value that has the same bitwise OR result with `max_index` as `p_0`.
   - **Final Call to `func_2`**: The function finally calls `func_2` with `max_index` and `min_index`, which are the indices that maximize the bitwise XOR operation.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the function `func_3` correctly implements the strategy to find the indices that maximize the bitwise XOR operation using at most 3n queries. The approach is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.
