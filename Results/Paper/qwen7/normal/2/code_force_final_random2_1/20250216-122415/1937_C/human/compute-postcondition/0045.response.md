Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the object `min_indices`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `min_indices`**:
   - `min_indices` is a list that contains either:
     - All integers from `0` to `n-1` if `res` was not `'<'` in any iteration.
     - Just the last integer `n-1` if `res` was `'<'` in all iterations.
   - `min_index` is the first element of `min_indices`.

3. **Understand the loop execution**:
   - The loop will iterate over each element in `min_indices`.
   - For the loop to execute, `min_indices` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is an iterator that takes values from `min_indices`, the key state to adjust is `min_indices`.
   - We need to ensure that `min_indices` is not empty, as this is the condition for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is `min_indices` must contain at least one element.

**State:**
**`min_indices` must contain at least one element**
