Output State: **`min_index` is the next element in `min_indices`, `i` is the next element in `min_indices`, `max_index` is the next element in `min_indices`, `res` is the return value of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)`**.

Explanation: The code `res = func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)` assigns the return value of the function `func_1` called with arguments `min_index`, `min_index`, `min_index`, and `i` to the variable `res`. The values of `min_index`, `i`, and `max_index` remain unchanged from their previous states. The loop condition `if i == max_index: continue` is not checked here, so the loop continues with the next elements if `i` does not equal `max_index`.
