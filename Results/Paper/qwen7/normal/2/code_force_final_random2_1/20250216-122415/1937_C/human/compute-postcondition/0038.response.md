Output State: **`i` is `n-1`; `min_indices` is `[i]`**

Explanation: The line `min_indices = [i]` creates a list containing the value of `i`. The value of `i` is `n-1` from the initial state. Therefore, `min_indices` becomes a list with one element, which is `n-1`. The other variables (`res`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
