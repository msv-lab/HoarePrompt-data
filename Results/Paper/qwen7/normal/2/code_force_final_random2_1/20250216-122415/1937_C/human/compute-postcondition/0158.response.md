Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 3
   - `v2` is `n-1`
   - `r` is the input string from the user
   - `v1` remains unchanged as `n-1`
   - `prev` is 2 if `r` equals `'>'`; otherwise, `prev` remains 1

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 3 (since it was 2 in the previous iteration).
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `n`. Since `i` is now 3, `n` must be greater than 3.

5. **Update the other variables**:
   - `v2` will remain `n-1`.
   - `r` remains the same as it is the input from the user and does not change within the loop.
   - `v1` remains `n-1`.
   - `prev` will be 2 if `r` equals `'>'`; otherwise, it remains 1.

Given these points, the updated state for the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the input string from the user, `v1` remains unchanged as `n-1`, and `prev` is 2 if `r` equals `'>'`; otherwise, `prev` remains 1**.
