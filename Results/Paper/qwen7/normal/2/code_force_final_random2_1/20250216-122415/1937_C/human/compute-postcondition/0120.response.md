Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1
- `n` must be greater than 1 (though its exact value is not specified, it does not affect the print statement)
- `v2` is 1

The print statement is `print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')`.

However, there is no definition for `v1` in the initial state. Since `v1` is not explicitly defined and its value is not provided, we cannot determine its value from the given information.

Given this, the print statement will include `v1` in its output, but since `v1` is undefined, we cannot specify its value.

Output: **? [v1] [v1] 1 1**
