Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 2, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is an input string from the user, `v1` remains unchanged as `n-1`, `prev` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `prev` to 0. None of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `v2`, `r`, `v1`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their values remain as they were in the initial state.
