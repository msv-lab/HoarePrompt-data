Output State: **`min_index` is the next element in `min_indices`, `i` is the next element in `min_indices`, `max_index` is the next element in `min_indices`, and `res` is the return value of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)`. We continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables `min_index`, `i`, `max_index`, or `res`, these variables retain their previous values. The only effect of the `continue` statement is that the loop will proceed to the next iteration without executing any code within the current iteration following the `continue` statement.
