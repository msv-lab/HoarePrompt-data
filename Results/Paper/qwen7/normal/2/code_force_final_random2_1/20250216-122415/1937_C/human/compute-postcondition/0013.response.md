Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables and their initial states:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.

2. **Understand the postcondition of the previous iteration:**
   - `res` is the result of `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)`.
   - If `res` equals `<`, then `max_index` is updated to `i`.
   - If `res` is not `<`, then `max_index` remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `res` is the result of the function call.
   - `max_index` might have been updated if `res` was `<`.

4. **Consider the loop head:**
   - The loop head involves the variable `i` and the condition `0 <= i < n`.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration:**
   - `i` starts from `0` in the first iteration and increases by `1` each time the loop runs.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `1` if it was `0` in the previous iteration.
   - The value of `max_index` might have changed based on the result of `func_1`.

Given these points, let's adjust the states for the next iteration:

- `i` will be `1` (assuming it was `0` in the previous iteration).
- `max_index` will remain the same unless `res` was `<` in the previous iteration, in which case it would have been updated to `i`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `max_index` from the previous iteration, we'll keep it as a general state.

**Final State:**
State: **`res` is the result of `func_1(0, max_index, 0, 1)`, `max_index` is either the same as before or 1 if `res` was `<` in the previous iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is the same as before**
