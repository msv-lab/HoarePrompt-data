Output State: **`min_index` is equal to `i`, `i` is equal to `max_index`, `res` is the return value of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)` and its current value is `'='`.**

Explanation: The line `min_index = i` updates the value of `min_index` to be the same as `i`. The values of `i` and `max_index` remain unchanged from their previous states. The value of `res` remains the return value of `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)`, which is `'='`.
