Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 1, `r` equals '>', and `prev` will be equal to `n-1`.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables or change their values. It only ensures that all previously written output is flushed to the standard output device. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state after the execution of this line of code.
