Output State: **`res` is the result of calling `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i + 1)`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `res` by calling `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` and also increments `i` by 1. Since `max_index` must be equal to the value it had at the end of the previous iteration, its value remains unchanged from the previous state. Therefore, the updated state includes `res` being the result of the new function call and `i` being incremented by 1.
