Output State: **`min_indices` is a list containing `i`, `i` is `n`.**

Explanation: The line `min_indices = [i]` replaces the entire `min_indices` list with a new list containing only the value of `i`. Since `i` is equal to `n`, the updated `min_indices` list contains `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
