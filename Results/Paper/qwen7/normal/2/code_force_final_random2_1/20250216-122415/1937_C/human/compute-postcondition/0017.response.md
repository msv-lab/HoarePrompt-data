Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `n-1`. For each iteration, it calls `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` and checks the result.
3. **Determine the state changes**:
   - If `res` is `<`, then `max_index` is set to `i`.
   - Otherwise, `max_index` remains unchanged and `i` remains unchanged.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `res` is the result of calling `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)`.
- If `res` equals `<`, then `max_index` is set to `i`.
- Otherwise, `max_index` remains unchanged and `i` remains unchanged.

Since we don't know the exact value of `res` from the previous iteration, we need to consider both possibilities:
- If `res` was `<`, then `max_index` would be updated to `i`.
- If `res` was not `<`, then `max_index` remains unchanged and `i` remains unchanged.

However, since we need to determine the state for the next iteration, we should consider the general case where `i` is incremented by 1 (since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration).

Therefore, regardless of the value of `res`, `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- `max_index` will remain unchanged unless `res` was `<` in the previous iteration, but we cannot assume this without knowing the exact value of `res`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`res` is the result of calling `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)`, `i` is `i + 1`, `max_index` must be equal to the value it had at the end of the previous iteration**.
