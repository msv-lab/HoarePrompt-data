Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 1; `v2` is 2; `r` is an input string from the user.**

The code `r = input('')` assigns the value entered by the user (as a string) to the variable `r`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `v2` remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 1 is still valid.
