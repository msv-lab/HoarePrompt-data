Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `prev` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer, `r` is an input string, `g` is 0, `kp` is 1, `v1` is `i + 2`, `v2` is `i`, `r` is a new input string**.

Explanation: The code `r = input('')` takes a new input from the user and assigns it to the variable `r`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
