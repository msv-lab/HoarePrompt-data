Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is 0
- `T` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4
- `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input
- `a` is the first element of `info` converted to an integer
- `b` is the second element of `info` converted to an integer
- `suma` is the sum of `x` values calculated for each iteration of the loop
- `i` is `b + 1`
- `x` is the last value of `x` calculated before the loop ends
- If `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` holds true, `suma` is updated to include the final `x` value

The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = b`, calculating the value of `x` for each `i` and updating the `suma` variable accordingly. After the loop completes, `i` will be `b + 1`, and `suma` will contain the cumulative sum of all valid `x` values calculated during the loop's execution.

Given the print statement:
```python
print(suma - 1)
```

The value of `suma` is the sum of all valid `x` values calculated during the loop. Since the loop updates `suma` with the value of `x` for each valid `i`, and then the print statement subtracts 1 from `suma`, the output will be `suma - 1`.

Output: **suma - 1 (where suma is the sum of all valid x values calculated during the loop's execution)**
