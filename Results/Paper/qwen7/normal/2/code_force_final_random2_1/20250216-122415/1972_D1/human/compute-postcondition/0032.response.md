Output State: **`b` must be at least 1, `x` is (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1**

Explanation: The code assigns the value `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` to the variable `x`. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `a` and `i`, and `b` is only mentioned to be at least 1, the output state reflects that `b` must still be at least 1 and `x` is calculated based on the given formula.
