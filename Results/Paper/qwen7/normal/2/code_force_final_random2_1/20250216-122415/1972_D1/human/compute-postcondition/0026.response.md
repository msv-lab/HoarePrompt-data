Output State: **`t` is 1, `T` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string.**

The code `info = input().split()` takes an input string from the user and splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace. The original values of `t` and `T` remain unchanged, and a new variable `info` is created to store the list of substrings resulting from the split operation.
