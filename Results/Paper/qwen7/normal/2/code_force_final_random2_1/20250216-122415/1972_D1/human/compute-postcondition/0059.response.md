Output State: **`a` is `int(info[0])`, `b` must be at least 1, `i` is 2, `x` is `(a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2`, `suma` is `x`, and `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `suma += x` adds the value of `x` to `suma`. Given that `x` is calculated as `(a - 2 * (2 - 1)) // 2`, which simplifies to `(a - 2) // 2`, the value of `suma` is now the sum of its previous value and this calculated `x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
