Output State: All variables outside the loop, including `T`, `info`, `a`, and `b`, retain their final values after the loop completes. Specifically, `b` is set to 0 because the loop increments `i` from 1 to `b`, and once `i` exceeds `b`, the loop terminates. `i` is thus `b + 1`, which is 1. `x` is the value calculated for the last iteration of the loop, which is `(a - b * (b - 1)) // b ** 2 + 1`. Since `b` is 0, `x` simplifies to `(a - 0 * (-1)) // 0 ** 2 + 1`, but since division by zero is undefined, we consider the practical outcome based on the loop logic where `b` is the highest value that allows the loop to run. `suma` is the cumulative sum of all valid `x` values calculated during each iteration where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` held true.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `b` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` is the value calculated for the last valid iteration, and `suma` is the total sum of all valid `x` values from the loop.
