Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Test Cases and Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Calculation of Valid Pairs:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the number of valid pairs `(i, j)` where `1 ≤ i ≤ a` and `1 ≤ j ≤ b`.
   - It uses a nested loop to iterate over possible values of `i` and `j`.
   - However, the inner loop condition and logic seem incorrect and do not match the problem statement.

3. **Inner Loop Logic:**
   - The original code snippet inside the comment block was intended to check the condition `if int((j+i)%(j*math.gcd(i,j))) == 0`, but this part is commented out.
   - Instead, the program uses a different formula `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` to compute `suma`.
   - This formula does not correctly implement the required condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

4. **Formula Explanation:**
   - The formula `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` seems to be an attempt to count something related to `i`, but it does not directly address the problem's requirements.
   - The division and modulus operations in the original condition are not handled correctly in the current implementation.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `suma - 1` for each test case, which is incorrect because `suma` is not computed correctly.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
