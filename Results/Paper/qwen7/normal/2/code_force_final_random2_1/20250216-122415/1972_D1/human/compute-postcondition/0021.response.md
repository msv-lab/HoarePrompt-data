Postcondition: **`t` is 0, `T` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `a` is the first element of `info` converted to an integer, `b` is the second element of `info` converted to an integer and must be at least 1, `suma` is `x + (a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3 + (a - 4 * (4 - 1)) // 4`, `i` is 4, `x` is `(a - 4 * (4 - 1)) // 4**.

This means that after executing the if-else block, `t` remains 0, `T` remains a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, `info` remains a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `a` remains the first element of `info` converted to an integer, `b` remains the second element of `info` converted to an integer and must be at least 1, `suma` is updated to `x + (a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3 + (a - 4 * (4 - 1)) // 4`, `i` remains 4, and `x` is updated to `(a - 4 * (4 - 1)) // 4`.
