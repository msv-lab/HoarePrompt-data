Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, b + 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `b`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `b`.

3. **Current State After Previous Iteration**:
   - `b` must be at least 1.
   - `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`.
   - `suma` is increased by `x`.
   - `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop condition is `i <= b`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i + 1` must still be less than or equal to `b`. This means `b` remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `b` remains the same.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`b` must be at least 1, `i` is `i + 1`, and `b` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`**.
