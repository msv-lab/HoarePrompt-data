### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identified that the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Let's re-evaluate the program and the function summary to confirm this conclusion.

#### Problem Restatement
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\)
2. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Program Analysis
The program attempts to solve this problem with the following steps:
1. It reads the number of test cases `T`.
2. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.
3. It then iterates over possible values of `i` from 1 to `b` and calculates a value `x` using the formula `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
4. It sums these values and prints the result minus one.

However, this approach is fundamentally flawed:
- The formula `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` does not correctly represent the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The inner loop and the logic inside it do not match the problem's requirements.

#### Function Summary Re-evaluation
The function summary states that the function processes multiple test cases and calculates a cumulative sum based on specific conditions involving \(a\) and \(b\). It then prints the final cumulative sum minus one. This summary does not accurately describe the actual logic implemented in the program.

#### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((i, j)\) and check if they satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        count = 0
        for i in range(1, a + 1):
            for j in range(1, b + 1):
                if (i + j) % (j * gcd(i, j)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)

func()
```

This corrected program correctly checks each pair \((i, j)\) and counts those that satisfy the condition.

### Final Evaluation

Given the analysis, the original program is indeed incorrect. The provided function summary does not accurately reflect the logic of the program, and the program itself does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Final: **False**
