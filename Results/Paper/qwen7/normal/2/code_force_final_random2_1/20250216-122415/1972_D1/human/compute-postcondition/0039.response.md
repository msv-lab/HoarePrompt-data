Output State: **`b` must be at least 1 and greater than or equal to `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.**

Explanation: The initial state includes the conditions that `b` must be at least 1 and also greater than or equal to `i + 1`, and `i` is `i + 1`. The code assigns a value to `x` based on the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. Since `i` is now `i + 1`, the value of `i` is updated, but the conditions on `b` remain unchanged. The value of `x` is calculated using the updated value of `i`.
