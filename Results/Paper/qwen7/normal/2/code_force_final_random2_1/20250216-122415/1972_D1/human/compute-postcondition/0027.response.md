Output State: **`t` is 1, `T` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `a` is an integer equal to the first element of `info`, and `b` is an integer equal to the second element of `info`.**

This output state reflects that the initial values of `t` and `T` remain unchanged, `info` is still a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, and two new variables `a` and `b` are assigned the integer values of the first and second elements of `info`, respectively.
