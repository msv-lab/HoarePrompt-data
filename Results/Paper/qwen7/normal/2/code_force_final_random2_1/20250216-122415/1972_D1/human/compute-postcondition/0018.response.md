Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `b`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is 0
   - `T` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4
   - `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input
   - `a` is the first element of `info` converted to an integer
   - `b` is the second element of `info` converted to an integer and must be at least 1
   - `suma` is `x + (a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3`
   - `i` is 3
   - `x` is `(a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3`
   - If `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` holds true, `suma` is updated to `x + (a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3`

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `b`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 4.
   - `b` remains unchanged because it is not modified inside the loop.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `t` remains 0.
   - `T` remains a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4.
   - `info` remains the same list of strings.
   - `a` remains the first element of `info` converted to an integer.
   - `b` remains the second element of `info` converted to an integer and must be at least 1.
   - `suma` remains `x + (a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3`.
   - `i` is now 4.
   - `x` remains `(a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3`.

Given these steps, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is 0, `T` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `a` is the first element of `info` converted to an integer, `b` is the second element of `info` converted to an integer and must be at least 1, `suma` is `x + (a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3`, `i` is 4, `x` is `(a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3`**
