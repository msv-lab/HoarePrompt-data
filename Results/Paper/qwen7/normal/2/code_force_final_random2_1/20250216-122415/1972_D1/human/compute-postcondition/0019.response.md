Output State: **`t` is 0, `T` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `a` is the first element of `info` converted to an integer, `b` is the second element of `info` converted to an integer and must be at least 1, `suma` is `x + (a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3`, `i` is 4, `x` is `(a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3`, `x` is updated to `(a - 4 * (4 - 1)) // 4 ** 2 + 1**.

To calculate the new value of `x`, we start with the expression `(a - 4 * (4 - 1)) // 4 ** 2 + 1`. Simplifying this, we get:

- `4 * (4 - 1)` simplifies to `4 * 3` which equals `12`.
- `a - 12` remains as `a - 12`.
- `4 ** 2` equals `16`.
- So, the expression becomes `(a - 12) // 16 + 1`.

Therefore, the new value of `x` is `(a - 12) // 16 + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.**
