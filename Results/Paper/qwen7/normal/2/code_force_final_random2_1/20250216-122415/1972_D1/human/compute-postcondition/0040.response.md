Output State: **`b` must be at least 1 and greater than or equal to `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `suma` is `suma + x`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `suma += x` updates the value of `suma` by adding `x` to its current value. The value of `x` is defined as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. The other variables (`b` and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated state includes the addition of `x` to `suma`.
