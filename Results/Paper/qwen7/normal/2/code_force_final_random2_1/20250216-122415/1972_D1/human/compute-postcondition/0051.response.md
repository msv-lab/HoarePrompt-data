Output State: **`b` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` is \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i\), `suma` is the sum of all `x` values calculated during the loop iterations, and `t` is \(T\); `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**

Explanation: The code `info = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The original values of `b`, `i`, `x`, `suma`, and `t` remain unchanged. The new variable `info` is created and assigned the list of strings obtained from the input.
