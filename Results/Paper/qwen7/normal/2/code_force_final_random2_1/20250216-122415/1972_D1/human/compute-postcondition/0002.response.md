Output State: **`t` is 0, `T` must be a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4; `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**

Explanation: The code `info = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The variable `t` remains unchanged with the value 0, and `T` is not affected by this operation. The variable `info` is assigned a list of strings resulting from the split operation.
