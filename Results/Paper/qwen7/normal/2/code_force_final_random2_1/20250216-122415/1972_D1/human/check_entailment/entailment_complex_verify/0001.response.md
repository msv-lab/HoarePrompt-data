### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement and the annotated code.

#### Problem Statement Recap
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Given Program Analysis
1. **Reading Test Cases and Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(T\) and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\).

2. **Calculation of Valid Pairs:**
   - The program uses a loop to iterate over possible values of \(i\) from 1 to \(b\).
   - Inside this loop, it computes \(x\) using the formula \(x = (a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\).
   - The variable `suma` accumulates the value of `x` for each valid \(i\).

3. **Inner Loop Logic:**
   - The formula \(x = (a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) is intended to count something related to \(i\), but it does not directly address the problem's requirements.
   - The division and modulus operations in the original condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) are not handled correctly in the current implementation.

4. **Formula Explanation:**
   - The formula \(x = (a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) is not derived from the problem statement and does not correctly implement the required condition.
   - The original condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) should be checked, but the current implementation does not do this.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `suma - 1` for each test case, which is incorrect because `suma` is not computed correctly.

#### Annotated Code Analysis
- The annotated code explains that the program attempts to count valid pairs \((i, j)\) but does not correctly implement the required condition.
- The formula used in the program does not match the problem statement and does not correctly count the valid pairs.

#### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
