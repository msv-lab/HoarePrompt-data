Output State: **`b` must be at least 1, `x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`, `suma` is increased by `x`, and `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The variable `x` is defined as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i`. This value is then added to `suma`, which means `suma` is increased by `x`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
