To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the calculations step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is `int(info[0])`: This means `a` is an integer derived from the first element of the `info` list.
   - `b` is the maximum integer such that the loop runs from 1 to `b`: This implies `b` is the largest integer for which the condition `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` holds true for all `i` from 1 to `b`.
   - `i` is `b + 1`: After the loop, `i` takes the value of `b + 1`.
   - `x` is `(a - b * (b - 1)) // b ** 2 + 1`: This is the value of `x` computed for the final iteration.
   - `suma` is the sum of all `x` values calculated during each iteration where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`.

2. **Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = b`.
   - For each `i`, `x` is calculated as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
   - `suma` accumulates the sum of these `x` values.

3. **Final Values:**
   - After the loop, `i` is `b + 1`.
   - `x` for the final iteration (when `i = b + 1`) is `(a - (b + 1) * b) // (b + 1) ** 2 + 1`.
   - `suma` is the sum of all valid `x` values from each iteration where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`.

4. **Calculation of `suma`:**
   - We need to find the sum of `x` values for each `i` from 1 to `b` where `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`.
   - The exact value of `suma` depends on the specific value of `a` and `b`, but we know that `suma` is the sum of all valid `x` values.

5. **Final Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(suma - 1)`.
   - Therefore, the output will be `suma - 1`.

Given the above analysis, the output will be:

Output: **suma - 1**
