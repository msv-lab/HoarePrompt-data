Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop runs as long as `i` is within the range `1` to `b + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is 0
   - `T` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq T \leq 10^4\)
   - `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input
   - `a` is the first element of `info` converted to an integer
   - `b` is the second element of `info` converted to an integer and must be at least 1
   - `suma` is `x`
   - `i` is 2
   - `x` is \((a - 1 \times (1 - 1)) // 1\) if \(a - i \times (i - 1) > 0\)

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - Since `b` is at least 1, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `b + 1`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `t` remains unchanged: `t` is still 0.
   - `T` remains unchanged: `T` is still a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq T \leq 10^4\).
   - `info` remains unchanged: `info` is still a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.
   - `a` remains unchanged: `a` is still the first element of `info` converted to an integer.
   - `b` remains unchanged: `b` is still the second element of `info` converted to an integer and must be at least 1.
   - `suma` remains unchanged: `suma` is still `x`.
   - `i` is updated to 3.
   - `x` remains unchanged: `x` is still \((a - 1 \times (1 - 1)) // 1\) if \(a - i \times (i - 1) > 0\).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is 0, `T` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `a` is the first element of `info` converted to an integer, `b` is the second element of `info` converted to an integer and must be at least 1, `suma` is `x`, `i` is 3, `x` is (a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1, if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`.**
