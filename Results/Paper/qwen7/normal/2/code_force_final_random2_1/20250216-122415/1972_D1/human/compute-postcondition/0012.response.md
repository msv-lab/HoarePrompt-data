Postcondition: `t` is 0, `T` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `a` is the first element of `info` converted to an integer, `b` is the second element of `info` converted to an integer and must be at least 1, `suma` is `x`, `i` is 2, `x` is (a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1, if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`.
