Output State: `t` is 0, `T` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `a` is the first element of `info` converted to an integer, `b` is the second element of `info` converted to an integer and must be at least 1, `suma` is the sum of `x` for each iteration where `i` ranges from 2 to `b` and the condition `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` holds true, `i` is `b + 1`, `x` is the last value calculated for the current `i`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `suma` will contain the sum of all `x` values calculated for each valid `i` (from 2 to `b`) based on the given formula, and `i` will be set to `b + 1`. The other variables (`t`, `T`, `info`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged from their initial or previous states.
