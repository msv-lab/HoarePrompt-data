Postcondition: `num` is a string representation of an integer between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive, `i` is `len(num) - 3`, and `tot` is 2. If the character at position `i` in `num` is not '0', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the character at position `i` in `num` is '0', then the postcondition remains unchanged as there is no other action specified in the else part.
