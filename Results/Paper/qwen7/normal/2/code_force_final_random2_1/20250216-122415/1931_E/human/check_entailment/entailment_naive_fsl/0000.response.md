Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not simulate the game turns correctly. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function attempts to determine the winner based on the sum of the lengths of the numbers after reversing and concatenating. However, it does not simulate the actual game turns where players take turns to reverse digits and concatenate numbers.

2. **Game Logic**: The game involves alternating turns between Anna and Sasha. Anna reverses the digits of a chosen number, and Sasha concatenates two numbers. The function provided does not simulate these alternating turns. Instead, it tries to determine the winner based on the sum of the lengths of the numbers, which is not a valid approach according to the problem description.

3. **Example Case**: Consider the following test case:
   ```
   2 2
   14 2
   ```
   - Anna can reverse the digit of 2, making it 2. Sasha can then concatenate 2 and 14 to form 214, which is greater than \(10^2 = 100\). Therefore, Sasha wins.
   - However, the provided function does not simulate this process and instead checks the length sum, which does not reflect the game logic.

Given that the function does not correctly simulate the game turns and does not follow the problem description, the program is incorrect.
