Output State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive, `i` is `len(num) - 1`, `tot` is 1.**

The code `tot += 1` increments the value of `tot` by 1. Initially, `tot` is not defined, so it is assigned the value 1. The conditions and values of `num` and `i` remain unchanged.
