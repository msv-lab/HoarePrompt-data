Output State: **The program returns the total count of trailing zeros in the string representation of an integer 'num', which is between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive.**

This means that the program will return the number of consecutive zeros at the end of the string `num`. Since the loop decrements `i` until it finds a non-zero digit or reaches the end of the string, `tot` will count the number of trailing zeros in `num`. The loop stops when `i` becomes less than 0, at which point `tot` holds the final count of trailing zeros.
