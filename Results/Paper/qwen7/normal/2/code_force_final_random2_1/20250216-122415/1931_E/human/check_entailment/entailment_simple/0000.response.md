### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided code step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the rules of the game and determines the winner based on the optimal play.

1. **Initial Setup and Input Handling:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of integers `n` and the parameter `m` for each test case.
   - It reads the list of integers `nums`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Base Case:** If `n == 1`, the function directly compares the length of the string representation of the single number with `m + 1`. This is correct because if there's only one number left, Sasha wins if the number is at least \(10^{m+1}\).
   - **General Case:** 
     - The function calculates the total number of digits in the list (`tot`).
     - It sorts the number of trailing zeros in each number (`cntvals`).
     - It iterates over the sorted list of trailing zeros, subtracting them from `tot`.
     - Finally, it checks if `tot` is greater than or equal to `m + 1` to determine the winner.

3. **Function `zerocnts`:**
   - This function correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in a number.
   - It converts the number to a string and iterates backward to find the first non-zero digit, counting the number of zeros before it.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Base Case Handling:**
  - The base case correctly handles the scenario where there is only one number left in the list. It checks if the length of the number (after reversing if necessary) is greater than or equal to \(m + 1\). This is correct.

- **General Case Handling:**
  - The general case logic is more complex but follows the rules of the game:
    - It calculates the total number of digits in the list.
    - It sorts the number of trailing zeros in each number.
    - It iteratively removes the largest number of trailing zeros (from the most significant numbers) until it determines if the remaining total number of digits is sufficient for Sasha to win.
    - This approach ensures that Sasha can always try to maximize the number of digits in the final number, while Anna tries to minimize it.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the rules of the game and uses an optimal strategy to determine the winner. The logic for handling the base case and the general case is sound and follows the problem description accurately.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
