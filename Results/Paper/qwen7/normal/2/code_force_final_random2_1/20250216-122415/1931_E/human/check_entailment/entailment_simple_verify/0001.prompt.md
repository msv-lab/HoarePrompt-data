You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

    #State: Output State: `num` is a string representation of an integer between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive, `i` is less than 0, `tot` is equal to the number of trailing zeros in `num`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to decrement `i` until it encounters a digit that is not '0' or it has iterated through the entire string `num`. The variable `tot` keeps a count of how many trailing zeros the string `num` has. Once `i` becomes less than 0, the loop terminates, and `tot` will hold the total count of trailing zeros in `num`.
    return tot
    #The program returns the total count of trailing zeros in the string representation of an integer 'num', which is between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine the winner of the game between Sasha and Anna.
   - Sasha and Anna take turns based on specific rules.
   - The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, and the final number must be checked against \(10^m\).

2. **Key Points in the Program**:
   - The program defines two functions: `func_1` and `zerocnts`.
   - `func_1` is the main function that decides the winner.
   - `zerocnts` calculates the number of trailing zeros in a number.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It checks if there's only one number (`n == 1`). If true, it compares the length of the reversed and original numbers to decide the winner.
   - It sums the lengths of all numbers after converting them to strings.
   - It sorts the count of trailing zeros in descending order.
   - It iterates over the sorted counts, subtracting every second count from the total sum.
   - Finally, it returns 'Sasha' if the total is greater than or equal to \(m+1\), otherwise 'Anna'.

4. **Function `zerocnts`**:
   - Converts the number to a string.
   - Counts the number of trailing zeros by iterating from the end of the string until a non-zero digit is found.
   - Returns the count of trailing zeros.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`**:
   - The logic for deciding the winner when there's only one number is flawed. The comparison should be based on the actual values, not just their lengths.
   - The logic for calculating the total length and subtracting the counts of trailing zeros is also incorrect. This approach does not align with the game rules.

2. **Missing Handling of Game Rules**:
   - The program does not implement the core game logic where players take turns reversing digits (Anna) and concatenating numbers (Sasha).
   - There is no mechanism to simulate the game turns and check the final condition.

3. **Incorrect Final Decision**:
   - The final decision in `func_1` is based on a flawed calculation. It should consider the actual values of the numbers after all operations, not just the sum of lengths or trailing zeros.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly implement the game logic and therefore cannot determine the correct winner based on the problem description.
