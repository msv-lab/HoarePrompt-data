Output State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive**.

Explanation: The code `num = str(num)` converts the integer value of `num` into its string representation. The range of `num` (between 1 and 10^9) remains the same, but now `num` holds a string value instead of an integer.
