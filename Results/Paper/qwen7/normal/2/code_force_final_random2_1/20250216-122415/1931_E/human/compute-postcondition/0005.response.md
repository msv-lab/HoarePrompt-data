Postcondition: `num` is a string representation of an integer between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive, `i` is `len(num) - 1`. If the last digit of `num` (i.e., `num[i]`) is not '0', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the last digit is '0', the program does not execute any additional operations specified in the else part.
