Output State: **`s` is not empty, `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` was greater than 0, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` was greater than 0, and `c` is 0.**

Explanation: The code checks if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0. If it is, `ans` is incremented by 1. Since `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1 when `c` is 0, and `c` is 0, `cnt[1]` (or rather `cnt[0]` since `c` is 0) will be greater than 0 after this increment. Therefore, `ans` is incremented by 1. The values of `s` and `c` remain unchanged.
