Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4. The length and content of the string `s` remain undefined as no operation was performed on it.
