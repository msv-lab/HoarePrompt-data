Output State: **`s` is not empty; `c` is the next character in `s`; `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code increments the count of the character `c` in the dictionary `cnt`. Since `s` is not empty and `c` is the next character in `s`, the count of `c` in `cnt` is increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
