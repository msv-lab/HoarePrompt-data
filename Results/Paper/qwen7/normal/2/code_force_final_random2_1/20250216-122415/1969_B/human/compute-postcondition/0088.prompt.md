Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
    zeroes = s.count(0)
    cnt = [0, 0]
    ans = 0
    for c in s:
        cnt[c] += 1
        if c == 0:
            ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
        else:
            ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all iterations, `ans` will be the sum of the following two components:

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `ans` is the sum of `zeroes - cnt[0]` for each non-zero element in `s` and 1 for each zero element in `s`, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `zeroes` is 0, `cnt` is a list where `cnt[0]` is the count of zeros and `cnt[1]` is the count of ones in the list `s`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all iterations, `ans` will be the total count of zeros in the list `s` plus the count of ones multiplied by the initial number of zeros minus the count of ones encountered so far. The variable `n` will be the length of the list `s`, `zeroes` will be 0 because it gets reset to the number of zeros in the list without any elements considered after the loop, and `cnt` will hold the final counts of zeros and ones in the list `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: All characters in the list `s` have been processed, `cnt[0]` contains the count of zeros in `s`, `cnt[1]` contains the count of ones in `s`, and `ans` is the sum of the minimum of `cnt[0]` and `cnt[1]` for each possible pair (0,1) throughout the iterations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
