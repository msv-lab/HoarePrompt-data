Output State: **`ans` is the sum of the two components, `n` is 0, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`.**

Explanation: The code counts the number of zeros in the list `s` and assigns this count to the variable `zeroes`. The values of `ans` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
