Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for c in s`. The variables involved in the loop head are `c` and `s`.

2. **Understand the postconditions given**:
   - `s` is not empty.
   - `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` was greater than 0 and `c` is 0.
   - `c` is 0.
   - `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` was greater than 0 and `c` is 0, otherwise `ans` is incremented by `zeroes - cnt[0]`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `c` is set to the next character in `s` in each iteration, `c` will be the next character in `s`.
   - `s` remains the same unless it becomes empty, but since the postcondition states that `s` is not empty, `s` will remain the same.

Given these points, let's adjust the states for the next iteration:

- `s` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration (it is not empty).
- `c` will be the next character in `s`.

Since no other variables are directly modified within the loop head, we do not need to adjust `cnt[1]`, `cnt[0]`, or `ans` in the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`s` is not empty, `c` is the next character in `s`**.
