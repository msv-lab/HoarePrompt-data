Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of an integer `t` and a binary string `s`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the counts of zeros and ones in the string `s`. Specifically, it computes the sum of the counts of zeros and the product of the count of ones and the initial count of zeros, adjusted as it iterates through the string.**
