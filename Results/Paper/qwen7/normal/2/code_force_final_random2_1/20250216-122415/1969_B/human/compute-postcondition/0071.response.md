Output State: **`s` must not be empty; `ans` is incremented by `zeroes - cnt[0]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += zeroes - cnt[0]` increments the variable `ans` by the value of `zeroes - cnt[0]`. Here, `zeroes` represents the number of zeros in the string `s`, and `cnt[0]` is the count of the character '0' in the string `s`. Since `s` must not be empty and `c` is not equal to 0, the count of '0' in `s` (which is `cnt[0]`) is updated, and `ans` is incremented by the difference between the number of zeros (`zeroes`) and the count of '0' (`cnt[0]`).
