Postcondition: `max` is the maximum value among the elements in the list `a` from index 0 to 2, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, `t` is `t - 1`, the list `a` is updated with integers inputted by the user, and the new `max` is not greater than the minimum of `a[2]` and `a[1]`. If `min(a[3], a[2]) > max`, then `max` becomes the minimum of `a[3]` and `a[2]`.
