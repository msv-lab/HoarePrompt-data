Postcondition: `max` is the maximum value among the elements in the list `a` from index 0 to i-1, `i` is incremented to 2, `n` must still be at least 2, `t` is `t - 1`, the list `a` is updated with integers inputted by the user, and either the minimum of `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is greater than the new `max` or the else part does not execute (implying the minimum of `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is not greater than the new `max`).
