Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The variable `i` is initialized to 1 in the loop head (`for i in range(1, n)`).
   - The variable `n` is the upper limit of the range, and the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the loop can start and continue executing. This means:
- `i` should be set to 1 (the starting value of the range).
- `n` should be greater than 1 (since the loop starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `n`).

The initial values of `t`, `a`, and `max` do not affect whether the loop can execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
