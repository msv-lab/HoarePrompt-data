The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` (which is just a placeholder since the variable name is not specified) and the variable `t`. Since the loop is controlled by `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is decremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` will be equal to `n`, `max` will hold the minimum value between any two consecutive elements in the list `a` from index 1 to `n-1`, and `n` will remain as it was initially.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Therefore, we need to decrement `t` by 1.

State: **`i` will be equal to `n`, `max` will hold the minimum value between any two consecutive elements in the list `a` from index 1 to `n-1`, `n` will remain as it was initially, and `t` will be `t - 1`**.
