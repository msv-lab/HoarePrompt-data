Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `max` holds the minimum value between any two consecutive elements in the list `a` from index 1 to `n-1`, `n` is an input integer, and `t` is `t - 1`; the list `a` is updated with integers inputted by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`. The values of `i`, `max`, `n`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.
