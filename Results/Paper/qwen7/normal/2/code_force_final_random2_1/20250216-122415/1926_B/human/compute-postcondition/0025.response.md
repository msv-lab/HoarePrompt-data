Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `j` and the range `range(n)`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `s` is a new input string.
   - `j` is incremented by 1.
   - `b` is 'SQUARE' if `s.count('1') > 1`, 'TRIANGLE' if `s.count('1') == 1`, and unspecified if `s.count('1') != 1`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` would be equal to its value before increment plus 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `j` should be set to `j + 1` from the previous iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is determined by the initial condition or the program logic outside the loop.

5. **Calculate the New Values**:
   - Let's assume `j` was `j_value - 1` at the start of the previous iteration (where `j_value` is the value of `j` after the increment).
   - After the increment, `j` becomes `j_value`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j_value` must be less than `n`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` and `n`. Specifically, `j` should be `j_value + 1` and `n` should remain as it was in the previous iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a new input string, `j` is incremented by 1, and `b` is 'SQUARE' if `s.count('1') > 1`, 'TRIANGLE' if `s.count('1') == 1', and unspecified if `s.count('1') != 1`. At the start of the next iteration, `j` must be less than `n`.**

To explicitly state the updated values:
- `j` is now `j_value + 1`.
- `n` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration.

So, the final state can be summarized as:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a new input string, `j` is `j_value + 1`, and `b` is 'SQUARE' if `s.count('1') > 1`, 'TRIANGLE' if `s.count('1') == 1', and unspecified if `s.count('1') != 1`.**
