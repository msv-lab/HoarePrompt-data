You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10; the input consists of n lines, each containing n characters that are either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that includes all the '1's in the grid.

    #State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `t`, which is the total number of iterations the loop was supposed to run. The variable `a` will be 'TRIANGLE' if at least one of the input strings contained exactly one '1'. Otherwise, `a` will be 0. The variable `b` will be 'SQUARE' if any of the input strings contained more than one '1'. If no input string contained exactly one '1' or more than one '1', `b` will remain its last assigned value, which could be 'TRIANGLE' or 'SQUARE'. The variable `j` will be equal to `n - 1` for the last iteration, but since the loop has completed, `j` will not be incremented further. The variable `s` will hold the last input string processed by the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n` and the grid itself.

2. **Checking for Triangle or Square:**
   - The program initializes two variables: `a` and `b`.
   - `a` is used to store the result if a triangle is detected.
   - `b` is used to store the result if a square is detected.
   - For each row in the grid, it counts the number of '1's.
     - If a row contains exactly one '1', it sets `a` to 'TRIANGLE'.
     - If a row contains more than one '1', it sets `b` to 'SQUARE'.

3. **Determining the Shape:**
   - After processing all rows, the program checks the value of `a`.
     - If `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE', it prints 'TRIANGLE'.
     - Otherwise, it prints 'SQUARE'.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Logic for Detecting Shapes:**
   - The logic for detecting a triangle or square is flawed.
   - The program only checks if any row has exactly one '1' or more than one '1'. This does not correctly identify the shapes.
   - For example, a triangle with multiple rows will have some rows with more than one '1', but this does not mean the entire shape is a square.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Multiple Rows:**
   - The program does not check if the '1's form a consistent pattern for a triangle or square across multiple rows.
   - For instance, a triangle with `k=3` would have rows like `11`, `111`, `11`. The program would incorrectly identify this as a square because some rows have more than one '1'.

3. **No Validation for Consistent Patterns:**
   - The program does not validate if the '1's form a consistent triangular or square pattern throughout the grid.

### Conclusion:

Given these issues, the program does not correctly identify whether the shape is a triangle or a square based on the provided problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
