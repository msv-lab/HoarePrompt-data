Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `j` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `j < n`. 

4. **Adjust the states based on the loop condition**:
   - Since `j` starts at 0, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0.
   - We don't need to adjust the state of `j` because it is initialized within the loop and will be incremented during each iteration.

5. **Consider other given variables**:
   - `a` is 0.
   - `b` is an empty string.
   - `s` holds the last input string processed by the loop.
   - `i` is `n + 2`.
   - `t` is the same as before.

6. **Determine if these variables need adjustment**:
   - `a` and `b` are not part of the loop head and their values do not affect the loop's execution.
   - `s` is processed inside the loop and its value will change with each iteration, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - `i` is `n + 2` and does not affect the loop's execution since it is not used in the loop itself.
   - `t` is unchanged and does not affect the loop's execution.

Therefore, the only variables that need adjustment are `n` (to ensure the loop can execute) and `j` (which is initialized to 0).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`j` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
