Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a grid of characters consisting of '0' and '1'. The grid has n rows and n columns where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10, and it contains exactly one triangle or one square made up of '1's. The function determines whether the shape formed by '1's is a triangle or a square and returns the result accordingly.**
