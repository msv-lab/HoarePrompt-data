Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify whether the grid contains a triangle or a square. Here's a specific case where the program fails:

Consider the following grid:
```
5

00111

00010

00000

00000

00000
```

This grid contains a triangle with `k=3`. However, the program will incorrectly identify this as a square because it checks each row individually and finds that only one row (`00111`) contains exactly one '1'. This leads the program to conclude that the shape is a triangle, but since it only checks for a single '1' in a row, it fails to recognize the pattern of a triangle.

To correctly identify the shape, the program needs to check for both the triangle and square patterns comprehensively. Specifically, it should verify the structure of the grid to ensure that the '1's form either a triangle or a square.
