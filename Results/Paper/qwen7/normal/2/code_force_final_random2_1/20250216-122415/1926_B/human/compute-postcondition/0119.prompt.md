Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and `t` is equal to the integer input, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = 0
    b = ''
    for j in range(n):
        s = input()
        if s.count('1') == 1:
            a = 'TRIANGLE'
        elif s.count('1') > 1:
            b = 'SQUARE'
    if a != 0:
        print(a)
    else:
        print(b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After the loop executes all its iterations, `n` must be equal to the total number of iterations executed. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`. The variable `a` will be 'TRIANGLE' if any of the input strings had exactly one '1', and 'SQUARE' if any of the input strings had more than one '1'. The variable `b` will be 'TRIANGLE' if any of the input strings had exactly one '1', and 'SQUARE' if any of the input strings had more than one '1'. If no input string had exactly one '1' or more than one '1', `a` and `b` will remain their last assigned values, respectively. The variable `j` will be equal to `n - 1` since it is incremented inside the loop. The variable `s` will hold the last input string processed by the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `a` is 'TRIANGLE' if at least one of the input strings contained exactly one '1'. Otherwise, `a` is 0. `b` is 'SQUARE', `s` holds the last input string processed by the loop, `i` is `n + 1`, and `j` is `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `j` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `b` is either 'SQUARE' (if any of the input strings contain more than one '1') or remains unchanged (if all input strings contain exactly one '1'), and `s` is updated to the new input string after the last iteration. The current value of `a` is not 0, or `b` remains unchanged (if all input strings contain exactly one '1'), and `b` is 'SQUARE' (if any of the input strings contain more than one '1'), and `s` is updated to the new input string after the last iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
