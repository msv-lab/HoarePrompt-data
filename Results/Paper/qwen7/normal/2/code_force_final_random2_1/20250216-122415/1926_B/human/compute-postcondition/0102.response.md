Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`. The loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 1
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `s` is an input string
   - If `s` contains exactly one '1', `b` remains unchanged.
   - If `s` contains more than one '1', `b` is set to 'SQUARE'.

3. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from `0` and increments by `1` each iteration, the next value of `j` would be `2`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `j < n`. Given that `j` was `1` at the end of the previous iteration and `n` is greater than `0`, the loop can still continue as long as `j < n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` will be incremented to `2`.
   - `n` remains unchanged and is still greater than `0`.
   - `s` remains the same input string.
   - The value of `b` remains unchanged unless the string `s` contains more than one '1'. Since we don't have information about the content of `s` changing, `b` remains as it was.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`j` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `s` is an input string, and `b` remains unchanged if `s` contains exactly one '1'; otherwise, `b` is set to 'SQUARE' if `s` contains more than one '1'**.
