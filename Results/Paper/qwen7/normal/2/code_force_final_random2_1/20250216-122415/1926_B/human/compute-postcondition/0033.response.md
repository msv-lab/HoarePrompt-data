Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `n` must be equal to the total number of iterations executed. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, `a` will be 'TRIANGLE' if any of the input strings had exactly one '1', and 'SQUARE' if any of the input strings had more than one '1'. The variable `b` will be 'TRIANGLE' if any of the input strings had exactly one '1', and 'SQUARE' if any of the input strings had more than one '1'. If no input string had exactly one '1' or more than one '1', `a` and `b` will remain their last assigned values, respectively. The variable `j` will be equal to `n - 1` since it is incremented inside the loop. The variable `s` will hold the last input string processed by the loop.
