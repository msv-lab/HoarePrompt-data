Output State: **`a` is 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n`, `s` holds the last input string processed by the loop, `a` and `b` will be either 'TRIANGLE' or 'SQUARE' based on the conditions given.**

Explanation: The line `a = 0` sets the variable `a` to 0. The values of `i`, `j`, `s`, and the conditions for `a` and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
