Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Loop Head Analysis
The loop condition is:
```python
while cnt and l < n + 1:
```

This means the loop will continue as long as both conditions are true:
1. `cnt` is non-zero (i.e., `cnt != 0`).
2. `l < n + 1`.

### Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\).
- `cnt` is `k - 1`.
- `l` is `func_2() + 1`.

### Adjusting the States
To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to satisfy both conditions in the loop head:

1. **Condition 1: `cnt != 0`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `cnt` is `k - 1`. For the loop to continue, `cnt` must remain non-zero. Since `k` is a positive integer (\(1 \leq k \leq n\)), `cnt` will always be non-negative. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `cnt` to remain non-zero.

2. **Condition 2: `l < n + 1`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `l` is `func_2() + 1`. For the loop to continue, `l` must be less than `n + 1`. To ensure this, `func_2()` must return a value such that `func_2() + 1 < n + 1`. This simplifies to `func_2() < n`.

### Conclusion
The only state that needs to be adjusted is the result of `func_2()`. Specifically, `func_2()` must return a value that ensures `func_2() + 1 < n + 1`.

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `cnt` is `k - 1`, `l` is `func_2() + 1` and `func_2()` must return a value such that `func_2() + 1 < n + 1`**
