Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4, and they are the result of `func_3()`**.

This means that the function `func_3()` has returned new values for `n` and `k` which are still within the constraints of being positive integers with `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^4`. The exact values of `n` and `k` depend on what `func_3()` returns, but they maintain the given conditions.
