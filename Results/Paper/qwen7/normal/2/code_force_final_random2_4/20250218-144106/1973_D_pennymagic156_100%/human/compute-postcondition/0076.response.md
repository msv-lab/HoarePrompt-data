Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `n` is a positive integer, but its specific value is not needed for this print statement.
   - `k` is explicitly given as `k`.
   - `l` is defined as `func_2() + 1`. Since `func_2()` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know it will be some integer plus one.
   - `cnt` is explicitly given as non-zero, but its specific value is not needed for this print statement.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
   ```

   - The `print` statement uses an f-string to format the output.
   - `{l}` will be replaced by the value of `l`, which is `func_2() + 1`.
   - `{i * v}` will be replaced by the value of `i * v`. Given that `i` is 2, this becomes `2 * v`.

   Since `v` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `i * v` will be `2 * v`.

Therefore, the print statement will output a string with placeholders for `l` and `i * v`.

Output: **'? [func_2() + 1] 2 * v'**
