Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `k` is `k` (no specific value given, so we keep it as `k`).
   - `l` is defined as `2 * func_2() + 2`.
   - `cnt` must be greater than 0 and `2 * func_2() + 2 < n + 1`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is 2.
- `l` is `2 * func_2() + 2`.
- `i * v` will be `2 * v` because `i` is 2.

However, the value of `v` is not explicitly given. Since `v` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, we will leave it as `v`.

Given these details, the print statement will output a string with placeholders for `l` and `i * v`.

Output: **'? 2 * func_2() + 2 2 * v'**
