Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n // k + 1`.

3. **Determine the current state**:
   - `i` is -1 (at the end of the previous iteration).
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `k` is `k - 3`.
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1`.
   - `cnt` is greater than 0.
   - `l` is less than `n + 1`.

4. **Analyze the loop execution**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be within the range from 1 to `n // k + 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently -1, it needs to be incremented to 1 for the loop to start.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` must be set to 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified in the loop head.
   - `k` is `k - 3`, but this is not directly affected by the loop itself.
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1`, but this is not directly affected by the loop itself.
   - `cnt` is greater than 0, but this is not directly affected by the loop itself.
   - `l` must still be less than `n + 1`.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `i`.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is `k - 3`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `cnt` is greater than 0, and `l` is less than `n + 1`**
