Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `k` is `k` (the value of `k` is not specified, but it is not used in the print statement).
   - `l` is `func_2() + 3 * (number of iterations)`. Since the number of iterations is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `l` from this information alone. However, we know that `l` equals `n + 1`.
   - `cnt` is 0.
   - `l` equals `n + 1`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'! {i * v}', flush=True)
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is 2.
- `v` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value.

Given the information, the only value we can definitively use in the print statement is `i`, which is 2. The value of `v` is unknown, so we cannot include it in the output.

Therefore, the print statement will output a string with `i * v` where `i` is 2, and `v` remains unknown.

Output: **! 2*v**
