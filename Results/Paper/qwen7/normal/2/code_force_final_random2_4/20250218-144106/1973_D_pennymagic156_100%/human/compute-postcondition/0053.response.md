Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `cnt and l < n + 1`.
2. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: For the loop to execute one more time, both parts of the condition must be true:
   - `cnt` must be non-zero (true).
   - `l < n + 1` must be true.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `k` is `k - 3`.
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1`.
   - `cnt` is 0.
   - `l` is less than `n + 1`.

4. **Analyze the current state**:
   - `cnt` is currently 0, which means the loop condition `cnt and l < n + 1` is false because `cnt` is false.
   - To make `cnt` non-zero, `cnt` must be adjusted to a non-zero value.
   - `l` is already less than `n + 1`, so no adjustment is needed for this part of the condition.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - We need to set `cnt` to a non-zero value to satisfy the loop condition.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is `k - 3`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `cnt` must be non-zero, `l` is less than `n + 1`**
