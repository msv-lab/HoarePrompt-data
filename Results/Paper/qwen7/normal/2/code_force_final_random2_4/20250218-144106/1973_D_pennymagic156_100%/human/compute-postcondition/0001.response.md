Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4, and `v` is 1.**

Explanation: The code initializes `v` to 1. Since `n` and `k` were the result of `func_3()` and their values are unchanged, they remain as positive integers satisfying the condition 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4. The variable `v` is newly introduced and set to 1.
