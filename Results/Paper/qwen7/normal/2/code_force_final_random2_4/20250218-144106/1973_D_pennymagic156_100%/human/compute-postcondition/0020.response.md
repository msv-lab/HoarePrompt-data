Output State: **`n` remains the same, `i` is `n-2`, `k` remains the same, `v` is the return value of `func_2()`**.

The code `v = func_2()` assigns the return value of the function `func_2()` to the variable `v`. Since the exact return value of `func_2()` is not specified, we can only say that `v` now holds whatever `func_2()` returns. All other variables (`n`, `i`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
