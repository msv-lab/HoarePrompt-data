### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the problem description step-by-step.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the largest value \( m \) such that the array can be split into \( k \) subarrays where each subarray's product of its length and its maximum equals \( m \).
   - The function `func_5` is supposed to perform the necessary queries to determine \( m \).

2. **Function `func_5`:**
   - The function starts by finding a potential value \( v \) using the first query `? 1 {i * n}`.
   - It then iterates over possible starting points for subarrays and checks if the value \( v \) holds for each subarray.
   - If \( v \) is consistent across all subarrays, it prints the final answer; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

3. **Issue with the Provided Program:**
   - The program assumes that the value \( v \) found in the first query is consistent across all subsequent queries. This is incorrect because the maximum value in the subarray can change as the subarray grows.
   - For example, consider the hidden array `[1, 3, 2]` with \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 2 \):
     - The first query `? 1 3 * 3` returns `2` because \( f(1, 2) = 2 \times 3 = 6 \).
     - The second query `? 1 6` would incorrectly assume the maximum value is `2` and return `2`, leading to an incorrect answer of `2`.
     - The correct answer should be `-1` because no valid split exists.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - For each subarray query, we need to re-evaluate the maximum value in the subarray.
   - We should iterate over the array and keep track of the maximum value for each potential subarray.

### Revised Program:

```python
import sys

def func_5():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    max_value = 1
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        print(f'? 1 {i * n}', flush=True)
        v = int(input())
        if v == n + 1:
            continue
        max_value = max(max_value, v // i)
    
    for i in range(1, n // k + 1):
        (cnt, l) = (k, 1)
        while cnt and l < n + 1:
            print(f'? {l} {i * max_value}', flush=True)
            l = int(input()) + 1
            cnt -= 1
        if cnt == 0 and l == n + 1:
            print(f'! {i * max_value}', flush=True)
            return
    print('! -1', flush=True)

func_5()
```

### Explanation of the Revised Program:
- The program first finds the maximum value \( v \) for the entire array using the first query.
- It then iterates over possible starting points for subarrays and uses the maximum value \( v \) to check if the subarray condition holds.
- If the condition holds for all subarrays, it prints the final answer; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was accurate. The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the maximum value in the subarray changes as the subarray grows. Therefore, the final evaluation remains:

**Final: False**
