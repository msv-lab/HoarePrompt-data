Output State: `i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is `k`, `l` is `func_2() + 3 * (number of iterations)`, `cnt` is `0 - number of iterations`.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `cnt` is non-zero and `l` is less than `n + 1`. Given that `cnt` starts at 1 and decreases by 1 with each iteration, it will eventually reach 0 after `cnt` number of iterations. Since `l` is incremented by `func_2() + 1` with each iteration, after `cnt` iterations, `l` will be equal to `func_2() + 3 * (number of iterations)` if we consider that `l` started at `func_2() + 0` (or simply `func_2()`). However, since `cnt` is decremented by 1 with each iteration, the exact value of `cnt` after all iterations will be `0 - number of iterations`, which simplifies to just `0` when the loop exits.
