Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < n // k + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is a positive integer
   - `k` is `k - 3 * cnt`
   - `l` is `func_2() + cnt`
   - `cnt` is 0
   - `l` is less than `n + 1`
   - `(cnt != 0 or l != n + 1)`

4. **Determine the new value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.

5. **Check if the loop condition is met**:
   - The loop condition is `i < n // k + 1`.
   - Given that `i` is now 2, the condition becomes `2 < n // k + 1`.
   - This implies that `n // k` must be 1 or less for the loop to stop. Therefore, `n // k` must be 1 for the loop to continue.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `n` remains a positive integer.
   - `k` remains `k - 3 * cnt` (which is still `k` since `cnt` is 0).
   - `l` remains `func_2() + cnt` (which is still `func_2()` since `cnt` is 0).
   - `cnt` remains 0.
   - `l` must still be less than `n + 1`.
   - `(cnt != 0 or l != n + 1)` must still hold true.

Given these adjustments, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is `k - 3 * cnt`, `l` is `func_2() + cnt`, `cnt` is 0, `l` is less than `n + 1`, and `(cnt != 0 or l != n + 1)`**
