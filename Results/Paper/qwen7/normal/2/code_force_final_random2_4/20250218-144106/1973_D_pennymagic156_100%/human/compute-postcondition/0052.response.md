Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is `k - 3`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `cnt` is 0, `l` is less than `n + 1**.

Explanation: The line `cnt -= 1` decrements the value of `cnt` by 1. Since `cnt` was initially 1, after this operation, `cnt` becomes 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
