Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i`, `n`, and the step `-1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` starts from `n`.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - The step is `-1`, meaning `i` decreases by 1 in each iteration.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0 (since the step is `-1`).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts from `n` and decreases by 1 in each iteration, the loop will continue as long as `i` is non-negative.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, but since `n` is given as a positive integer, this is already satisfied.
   - The variable `i` should start at `n` and decrease until it reaches 0.

5. **Consider the constraints**:
   - `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^4`: This means `n` is within the specified range.
   - `v` is 1 and is not involved in the loop head, so no adjustment is needed for `v`.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`**
