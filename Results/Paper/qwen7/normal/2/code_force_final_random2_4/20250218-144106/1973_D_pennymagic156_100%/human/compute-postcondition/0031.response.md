Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `cnt` is `k - 1`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`**

Explanation: The code decrements `cnt` by 1. Initially, `cnt` is equal to `k`. After the decrement, `cnt` becomes `k - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
