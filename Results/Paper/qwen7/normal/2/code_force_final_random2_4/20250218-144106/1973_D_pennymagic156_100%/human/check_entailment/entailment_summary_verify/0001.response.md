### Reasoning

The original assessment identified several issues with the provided Python program. Let's review the corrected version and ensure it meets the requirements of the problem statement.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The functions `func_1()`, `func_2()`, `func_3()`, and `func_4()` are correctly defined to read input as expected.

2. **Determining `v`:**
   - The corrected version first determines the maximum value in the array by querying for the smallest `r` such that `f(1, r) = i * n` for decreasing values of `i` starting from `n`. This ensures that `max_val` is correctly set to the maximum value in the array.

3. **Splitting the Array:**
   - After determining `max_val`, the program attempts to split the array into `k` subarrays such that each subarray has the property `f(l, r) = i * max_val` for decreasing values of `i` starting from `k`.
   - If a valid split is found, it prints the value `i * max_val` and ends.
   - If no valid split is found, it prints `-1`.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The corrected version handles the case where the maximum value is 1, indicating that no valid split exists.

The corrected version ensures that the program correctly determines the maximum value in the array and uses it to check for valid splits. It also handles edge cases properly.

### Final Evaluation

Given the corrections and the detailed analysis, the program now correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

**Final: True**

The program is now correct according to the problem description and the provided function summaries.
