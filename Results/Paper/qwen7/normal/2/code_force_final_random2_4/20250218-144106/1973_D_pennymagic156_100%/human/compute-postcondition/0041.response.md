Output State: `i` is -1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is `k - 3`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`.

Explanation: After each iteration of the loop, `cnt` decreases by 1 and `l` is updated to `func_2() + 1`. The loop continues as long as `cnt` is greater than 0 and `l` is less than or equal to `n + 1`. Given that the loop has executed 3 times, `cnt` would be `k - 3` (since it started at `k` and decreased by 1 each time). Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will be -1, `cnt` will be `k - 3`, and `l` will be `func_2() + 1`.
