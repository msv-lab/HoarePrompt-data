Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `k` is `k - 3 * cnt`, but since `cnt` is 0 initially, this simplifies to `k` (assuming `k` was previously set to some value).
   - `l` is `func_2()`, and it is also given that `l` is equal to `n + 1`.
   - `cnt` is 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(f'! {i * v}', flush=True)`.
   - Here, `v` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we need to infer its value. Since no other information about `v` is provided, we assume `v` is a variable that needs to be defined elsewhere or is a placeholder for a value that doesn't affect the current context.

Given the information, we can conclude:
- `i` is 1.
- `v` is not explicitly defined, but since it is not used in the calculation and the print statement only multiplies `i` by `v`, we can consider `v` as 1 if no other value is provided (common assumption for such placeholders).

Thus, the expression `i * v` evaluates to `1 * 1 = 1`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **! 1**
