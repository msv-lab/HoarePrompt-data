Output State: **n is a positive integer, i is 0, k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and v is either n (if the loop broke due to v == n) or the return value of func_2() (if the loop did not break).**

Explanation: The loop runs from `n` down to `1`. After the third iteration, `i` becomes `n-3`. The loop will continue to decrement `i` until it reaches `0`. At this point, the loop terminates. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will be `0`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The value of `v` will be `n` if the loop breaks due to `v == n` at any point, or it will be the return value of `func_2()` if the loop completes without breaking.
