Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is `k - 3 * cnt`, `l` is `n + 1`, `cnt` is 1, `l` is `n + 1**.

Explanation: The function `func_2()` is called, which updates the value of `l`. Since `l` was initially equal to `n + 1`, calling `func_2()` does not change its value. However, `func_2()` also increments `cnt` by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
