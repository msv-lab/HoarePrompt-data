Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code `s = list(map(int, input().strip()))` takes an input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and then maps each element to an integer, storing the result in the list `s`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
