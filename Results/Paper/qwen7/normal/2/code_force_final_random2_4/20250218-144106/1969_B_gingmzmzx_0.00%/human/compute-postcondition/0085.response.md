Postcondition: `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, `ans` is updated as follows: if `c` is 0 and `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, then `ans` is updated to `ans + 1`; if `c` is 0 and `cnt[1]` is not greater than 0, or if `c` is not 0, then `ans` is updated by adding `zeroes - cnt[0]`. `zeroes` remains unchanged.
