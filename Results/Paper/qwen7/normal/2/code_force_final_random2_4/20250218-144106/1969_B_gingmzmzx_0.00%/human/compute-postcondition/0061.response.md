Output State: **`n` is `n - 1`, `s` is a list of integers (converted from input), `cnt[c]` for each character `c` in `s` contains the total count of that character in `s`, `ans` is the sum of `zeroes - cnt[0]` for each non-zero character in `s` and 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0 for any zero character in `s`**.

Explanation: The code `s = list(map(int, input().strip()))` takes an input, strips any leading/trailing whitespace, and then maps each character in the input to an integer. This changes the type of elements in `s` from strings to integers. The initial conditions regarding `n`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged except that `s` is now a list of integers.
