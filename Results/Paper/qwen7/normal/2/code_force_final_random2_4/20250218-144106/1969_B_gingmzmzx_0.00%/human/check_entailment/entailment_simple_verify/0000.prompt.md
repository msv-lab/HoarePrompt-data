You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program: 
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        cnt = [0, 0]
        ans = 0
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, s is a binary string such that 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and s_i ∈ {0, 1}.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        
        cnt = [0, 0]
        
        ans = 0
        
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `ans` will contain the sum of all instances where a '0' appears in the list `s` and there is at least one '1' in the list so far (contributing 1 to `ans` for each such instance). Additionally, `ans` will also include the difference between the total number of zeros (`zeroes`) and the count of '0's (`cnt[0]`) for each non-zero character '1' in the list `s`. The variable `n` will be decremented to 0 after all iterations, and `t` will retain its initial value as it is not affected by the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. However, the program attempts to count the number of inversions in the string, which is not the correct approach.

To illustrate why this program is incorrect, consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
1
101011
```

**Expected Output:**
```
9
```

**Actual Output:**
```
5
```

The program counts the number of positions where a '0' appears after a '1', but this does not account for the minimum cost required to sort the string through cyclic shifts. For instance, the string "101011" can be sorted by performing the following cyclic shifts:

1. Choose the substring [3, 6]: "101011" → "110101"
2. Choose the substring [2, 4]: "110101" → "110011"
3. Choose the substring [4, 5]: "110011" → "110001"
4. Choose the substring [3, 4]: "110001" → "110000"
5. Choose the substring [2, 3]: "110000" → "110000"

The total cost is 4 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 13, but the program incorrectly calculates the cost as 5.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
