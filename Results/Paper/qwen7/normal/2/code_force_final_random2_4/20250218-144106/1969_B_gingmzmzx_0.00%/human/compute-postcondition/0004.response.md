Output State: **`zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `cnt` is [0, 0]**.

Explanation: The code initializes the list `cnt` with two zeros. This does not affect the values of `zeroes`, `t`, or `n`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions. The list `cnt` is updated to `[0, 0]`.
