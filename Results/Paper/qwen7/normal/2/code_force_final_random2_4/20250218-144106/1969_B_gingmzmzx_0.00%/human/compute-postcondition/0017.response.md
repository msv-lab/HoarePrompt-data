Output State: **`ans` is either 1 or `zeroes - cnt[0]`, depending on whether the second character in the list `s` is 0 or not; `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s` plus 1; `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` must be greater than 0; `cnt` is [1, 1]; `c` is the second character in the list `s` and its count in `cnt` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt[c] += 1` increments the count of the character `c` in the list `cnt`. Initially, `cnt` is [1, 0], meaning there is one zero and no ones. After the code runs, if `c` is '0', `cnt` becomes [1, 1], and if `c` is '1', `cnt` remains [1, 1]. Since `c` is the second character in the list `s`, the value of `ans` is updated accordingly.
