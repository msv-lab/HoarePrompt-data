The only objects in the loop head are `tc` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tc` and `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `a` must have at least one element, and `mexsize` will be incremented by 1 every time an element in `a` equals `mexsize`. The final value of `mexsize` will be the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `tc` must be less than `t`. Therefore, `tc` should be incremented by 1, making it `tc + 1`, and `t` remains unchanged.

State: **`a` must have at least one element, `mexsize` will be incremented by 1 every time an element in `a` equals `mexsize`, the final value of `mexsize` will be the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`, `tc` is incremented by 1, and `t` remains unchanged.**
