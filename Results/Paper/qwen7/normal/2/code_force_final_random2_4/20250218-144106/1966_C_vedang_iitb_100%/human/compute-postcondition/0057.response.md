Output State: **`a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `mexsize` is updated to the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`, `tc` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `t` remains unchanged, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a` before any elements were potentially incremented within the loop, if the current value of `mexsize` is greater than the current value of `maxsize`, then `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`; otherwise, `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`.**

Explanation: The code reads a list of integers from the user input and stores it in the variable `a`. This changes the value of `a` to the list of integers provided by the user. All other variables remain in their previous states as described in the initial state.
