Output State: **`mexsize` is `mexsize + 1`, `sz` is the first element of the list `a`, `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code increments `mexsize` by 1. The value of `sz` remains unchanged as it was initially set to `mexsize`. The list `a` and its properties (being a sorted list of integers entered by the user) also remain unchanged.
