Output State: **`mexsize` is `mexsize` + 1, `sz` is the second element of the list `a`, `a` is the list `a` excluding its first element.**

Explanation: The code increments `mexsize` by 1. The values of `sz` and the list `a` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `sz` is still the second element of the list `a`, and `a` is the list `a` excluding its first element. The updated value of `mexsize` is `mexsize` + 1.
