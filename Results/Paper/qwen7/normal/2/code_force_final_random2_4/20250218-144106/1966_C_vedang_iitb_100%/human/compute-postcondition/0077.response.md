Based on the initial state provided:

- `sz` is now the last element of the original list `a`.
- `mexsize` has not been incremented for each occurrence where `sz` equals `mexsize`.
- `a` is now an empty list.

We need to determine the value of `mexsize` to decide whether it is odd or even. Since `mexsize` has not been incremented for each occurrence where `sz` equals `mexsize`, this implies that `sz` is equal to `mexsize`. Therefore, `mexsize` must be equal to `sz`.

Given that `sz` is the last element of the original list `a`, and assuming `a` was not empty before the iteration, `sz` is a valid integer from the original list. 

To determine whether `mexsize % 2 == 1` or `mexsize % 2 == 0`, we need to consider the parity of `sz`. Without loss of generality, let's assume `sz` is any integer. If `sz` is odd, then `mexsize` is also odd, and if `sz` is even, then `mexsize` is also even.

However, since the exact value of `sz` is not specified, we can only say that `mexsize` is either odd or even based on the value of `sz`.

Thus, the print statement will output either "Alice" or "Bob" depending on the parity of `mexsize`.

Output: **Alice if sz (and hence mexsize) is odd, else Bob**
