Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `sz` is the first element of the list `a`.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user.
- If `sz` equals `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is incremented by 1.

### Loop Head
The loop head is defined by the variable `sz` in the for loop:
```python
for sz in a:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Key Points to Consider
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `a`.
2. **Variable Adjustments**: We need to adjust the state of `sz` and `a` for the next iteration.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial Values**:
   - `sz` is set to the first element of the list `a`.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers.

2. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `sz` is the first element of the list `a`.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers.
   - If `sz` equals `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is incremented by 1.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `sz` will be the next element in the list `a`.
   - The list `a` will be updated to exclude the current `sz`.

### Adjusted States
- **sz**: It will be the second element of the list `a` (since it was the first element in the previous iteration).
- **a**: The list `a` will be updated to exclude the first element (the current `sz`).

### Final State
- `sz` will be the second element of the list `a`.
- `a` will be the list `a` excluding its first element.

### Answer
State: **`sz` is the second element of the list `a`, `a` is the list `a` excluding its first element**.
