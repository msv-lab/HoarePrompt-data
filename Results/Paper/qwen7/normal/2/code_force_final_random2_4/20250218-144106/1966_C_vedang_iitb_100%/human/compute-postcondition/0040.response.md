Output State: **`a` is a list containing at least one element (excluding the first element), `sz` is the second element in the original list `a`, `mexsize` is `sz` + 1**.

Explanation: The code `mexsize = mexsize + 1` increments the value of `mexsize` by 1. Since `sz` is the second element in the original list `a`, `mexsize` is now equal to `sz + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
