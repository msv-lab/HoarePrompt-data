Output State: **`a` is updated to a list of integers from the input, `mexsize` is incremented by 1 for each element in `a` that equals `mexsize`, the final value of `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`, `tc` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, and `t` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `a`. The values of `mexsize`, `tc`, `n`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states, except that `mexsize` is incremented by 1 for each element in `a` that equals `mexsize`. The final value of `mexsize` will be the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.
