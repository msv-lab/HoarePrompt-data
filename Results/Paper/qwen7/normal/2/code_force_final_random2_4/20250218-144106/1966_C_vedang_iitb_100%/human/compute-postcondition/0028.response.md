Output State: **`a` must have at least one element, `mexsize` will be incremented by 1 every time an element in `a` equals `mexsize`, the final value of `mexsize` will be the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`, `tc` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, and `t` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the user input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This does not affect the values of `a`, `mexsize`, `tc`, or `t`. The precondition that `a` must have at least one element and that `mexsize` will be incremented by 1 every time an element in `a` equals `mexsize`, and that `tc` is incremented by 1 remain unchanged. The value of `t` also remains unchanged.
