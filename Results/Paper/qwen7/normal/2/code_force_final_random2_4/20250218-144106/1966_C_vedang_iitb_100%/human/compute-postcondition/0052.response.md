Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is a sorted list of integers with all elements processed.
- `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.
- `tc` is incremented by the number of iterations, which is equal to the length of the list `a`.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 1 else 'Bob')`.

To do this, we need to evaluate the expression `mexsize % 2 == 1`:

- `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.
- Since `a` is a sorted list of integers, `mexsize` must be a positive integer that is not in the list.

Given that `mexsize` is a positive integer, let's consider its parity (whether it is odd or even):

- If `mexsize` is odd, the expression `mexsize % 2 == 1` evaluates to `True`, and the statement prints `'Alice'`.
- If `mexsize` is even, the expression `mexsize % 2 == 1` evaluates to `False`, and the statement prints `'Bob'`.

Since the exact value of `mexsize` is not provided, we cannot determine whether it is odd or even precisely. However, we know it is a positive integer not present in the list `a`.

Therefore, the output will depend on the parity of `mexsize`:

Output: **'Alice' if mexsize is odd else 'Bob' (where mexsize is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`)**
