Output State: **`a` must have at least one element, `mexsize` is `mexsize + 1`**.

Explanation: The code increments `mexsize` by 1. Since `mexsize` could either be `mexsize + 1` or remain the same, after executing `mexsize = mexsize + 1`, `mexsize` is now `mexsize + 1`. The precondition that `a` must have at least one element remains unchanged.
