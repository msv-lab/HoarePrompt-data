The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), consisting only of the characters "U" and "D", where "U" represents a coin facing up and "D" represents a coin facing down. The function checks if the string `s` contains an equal number of "U" and "D" characters. If the counts are equal, the function returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and return 'YES' if the number of "U" and "D" characters are equal, otherwise return 'NO'.
