Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `ap` is an input integer.
- `k` must be between 0 and `ap`-1 (inclusive).
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is an input integer, and it is explicitly stated that `y` is equal to 0.
- `x` is greater than 0.

We need to evaluate the expression `math.ceil(x / 15)`.

Since `y` is explicitly given as 0, this value does not affect the expression being evaluated. The expression focuses on `x`, which is a positive integer.

The `math.ceil` function rounds up the result of the division `x / 15` to the nearest integer greater than or equal to the division result.

Given that `x` is a positive integer, the value of `math.ceil(x / 15)` will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `x / 15`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **math.ceil(x / 15)**
