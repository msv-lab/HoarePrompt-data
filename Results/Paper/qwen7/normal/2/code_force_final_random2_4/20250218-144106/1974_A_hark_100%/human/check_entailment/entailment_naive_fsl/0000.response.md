Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for placing the icons. Let's consider the following example:

- For `x = 12` and `y = 4`, the program should calculate the minimum number of screens needed. However, the logic in the program is flawed.

The program attempts to handle different cases but does not correctly account for the placement of 2x2 icons and the remaining 1x1 icons. Specifically, the calculation for `bxsfory1` and the subsequent adjustments to `x` are incorrect.

A correct approach would involve calculating the number of full 5x3 grids needed for the 2x2 icons and then determining how many additional screens are needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func_1():
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the number of full 5x3 grids needed for 2x2 icons
        grids_for_2x2 = math.ceil(y / 2)
        # Calculate the remaining 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons
        remaining_1x1 = x - (grids_for_2x2 * 15)
        # Calculate the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons
        grids_for_1x1 = math.ceil(remaining_1x1 / 15)
        # Total number of screens needed
        total_grids = grids_for_2x2 + grids_for_1x1
        print(total_grids)

func_1()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed for both 2x2 and 1x1 icons.
