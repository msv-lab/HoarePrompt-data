Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case consists of two integers t, x, and y. For each test case, if t is within the range 1 to 10^4, it processes x and y which are integers between 0 and 99, but does not return any specific value based on the given information.**

Given the constraints and the lack of specific return conditions in the provided output, it appears the function processes multiple test cases but does not explicitly return a value from the function itself.
