Output: **math.ceil(x / 15)**

Explanation: Based on the initial state, `x` is an input integer from the first input split. The `print` statement calculates the ceiling of `x` divided by 15 using the `math.ceil` function. Since the exact value of `x` is not provided, the output is expressed as the result of the `math.ceil(x / 15)` function.
