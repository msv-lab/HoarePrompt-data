Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is an input integer, `k` must be between 0 and `ap`-1 (inclusive), `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, `bxsfory` is the ceiling value of `y` divided by 2.**

This means that the value of `x` has been updated according to the formula `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, where `bxsfory` is calculated as the ceiling value of `y` divided by 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
