Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `ap` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `k` is 1, `x` is an input integer from the first input split, `y` is an input integer from the second input split.**

The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input, splits them based on whitespace, and converts each to an integer before assigning them to `x` and `y` respectively. The values of `t`, `ap`, and `k` remain unchanged.
