Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is an input integer, `k` must be between 0 and `ap`-1 (inclusive), `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `x` and `y` respectively. The values of `t` and `ap` remain unchanged. The condition for `k` remains the same, but since `k` is not involved in the current code snippet, it is not updated.
