Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `ap` is an input integer.
- `k` must be between 0 and `ap`-1 (inclusive).
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is an input integer.
- `x` is less than or equal to 0.
- `y` is greater than 0.

The `print(math.ceil(y / 2))` statement calculates and prints the ceiling of `y / 2`.

Since `y` is a positive integer, `y / 2` will be a positive number if `y` is even, or a positive number slightly less than an integer if `y` is odd. The `math.ceil` function will round this up to the nearest integer.

Therefore, the output will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `y / 2`.

Output: **math.ceil(y / 2)**
