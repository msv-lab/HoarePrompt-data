Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `ap` is an input integer, `k` is 0, `x` is an input integer - `bxsfory` * 15 + `y` * 4, `y` is an input integer, `bxsfory` is the ceiling of `y` divided by 2, `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x` is less than or equal to 0 else the ceiling of `x` divided by 15.**

Explanation: The code assigns a value to `bxsfory1` based on the condition `if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)`. This means:
- If `x` is less than or equal to 0, `bxsfory1` is set to 0.
- Otherwise, `bxsfory1` is set to the ceiling of `x` divided by 15.

All other variables (`t`, `ap`, `k`, `x`, `y`, and `bxsfory`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
