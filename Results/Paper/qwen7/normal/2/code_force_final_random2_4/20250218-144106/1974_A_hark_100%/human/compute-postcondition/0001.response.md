State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is an input integer, `k` must be between 0 and ap-1 (inclusive)**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `k` is initialized to 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
2. The loop runs as long as `k` is less than `ap`.
3. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `k` must be between 0 and `ap-1` inclusive.
4. The initial values of `t` and `ap` do not directly affect the loop's execution condition, but they are part of the program state.

Hence, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `k` must be between 0 and `ap-1` inclusive.
