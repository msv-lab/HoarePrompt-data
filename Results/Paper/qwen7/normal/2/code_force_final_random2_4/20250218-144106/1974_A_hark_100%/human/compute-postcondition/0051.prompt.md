You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.
def func_1():
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        if x > 0 and y > 0:
            bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
            x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
            bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)
            print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
        elif x == 0 and y > 0:
            print(math.ceil(y / 2))
        elif x > 0 and y == 0:
            print(math.ceil(x / 15))
        else:
            print(0)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is an input integer, `k` is equal to `ap`, and `x` is updated according to the loop's logic for each iteration. Specifically, if `x > 0` and `y > 0`, `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, where `bxsfory` is the ceiling value of `y / 2`. If `x <= 0`, `x` remains unchanged. If `x == 0` and `y > 0`, `x` remains unchanged. If `x > 0` and `y == 0`, `x` is updated to `math.ceil(x / 15)`. If neither condition is met, `x` remains unchanged. The value of `bxsfory1` is calculated as 0 if `x <= 0` else the ceiling value of `x / 15` if `x > 0` and `y > 0`. The value printed in each iteration is either `bxsfory1 + bxsfory` if both `x > 0` and `y > 0`, `math.ceil(y / 2)` if `x == 0` and `y > 0`, `math.ceil(x / 15)` if `x > 0` and `y == 0`, or `0` otherwise.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case consists of two integers t, x, and y. For each test case, if t is within the range 1 to 10^4, it processes x and y which are integers between 0 and 99, but does not return any specific value based on the given information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
