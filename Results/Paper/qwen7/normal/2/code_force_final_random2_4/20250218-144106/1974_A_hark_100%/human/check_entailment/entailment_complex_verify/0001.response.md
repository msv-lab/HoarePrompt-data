### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step based on the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Problem Description Recap
- The grid size is \(5 \times 3\), meaning each screen can hold up to 15 icons.
- Icons of size \(1 \times 1\) occupy 1 cell.
- Icons of size \(2 \times 2\) occupy 4 cells.
- We need to minimize the number of screens required to fit all icons.

#### Program Analysis
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases (`ap`), and for each test case, it processes the input values of `x` and `y`.
   - It calculates the number of screens needed based on the logic provided in the code.

2. **Key Logic in `func_1`**:
   - The logic tries to handle different cases where either `x` (number of \(1 \times 1\) icons) or `y` (number of \(2 \times 2\) icons) are non-zero.
   - The formula used is:
     - `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)` which calculates how many full screens can be filled by \(2 \times 2\) icons.
     - Adjustments are made to `x` to account for the space taken by \(2 \times 2\) icons.
     - `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)` which calculates how many additional screens are needed for the remaining \(1 \times 1\) icons.
     - Finally, the total number of screens is calculated as `bxsfory1 + bxsfory`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If both `x` and `y` are zero, it prints `0`, which is correct.
   - If only `x` is non-zero, it correctly calculates the number of screens needed using `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
   - If only `y` is non-zero, it correctly calculates the number of screens needed using `math.ceil(y / 2)`.

#### Detailed Testing
Let's verify the logic with the example provided in the problem statement:

- For the first test case: \(x = 1\), \(y = 1\)
  - \( \text{Screens for } 2 \times 2 \text{ icons} = \lceil 1 / 2 \rceil = 1 \)
  - Remaining \(1 \times 1\) icons after placing \(2 \times 2\) icons: \(1 - 1 \times 4 = -3\) (no change since we can't have negative icons)
  - Screens for \(1 \times 1\) icons: \( \lceil 0 / 15 \rceil = 0 \)
  - Total screens: \(1 + 0 = 1\)

- For the second test case: \(x = 7\), \(y = 2\)
  - \( \text{Screens for } 2 \times 2 \text{ icons} = \lceil 2 / 2 \rceil = 1 \)
  - Remaining \(1 \times 1\) icons after placing \(2 \times 2\) icons: \(7 - 1 \times 4 = 3\)
  - Screens for \(1 \times 1\) icons: \( \lceil 3 / 15 \rceil = 1 \)
  - Total screens: \(1 + 1 = 2\)

- For the third test case: \(x = 12\), \(y = 4\)
  - \( \text{Screens for } 2 \times 2 \text{ icons} = \lceil 4 / 2 \rceil = 2 \)
  - Remaining \(1 \times 1\) icons after placing \(2 \times 2\) icons: \(12 - 2 \times 4 = 4\)
  - Screens for \(1 \times 1\) icons: \( \lceil 4 / 15 \rceil = 1 \)
  - Total screens: \(2 + 1 = 3\)

- For the fourth test case: \(x = 0\), \(y = 3\)
  - \( \text{Screens for } 2 \times 2 \text{ icons} = \lceil 3 / 2 \rceil = 2 \)
  - Total screens: \(2\)

- For the fifth test case: \(x = 1\), \(y = 0\)
  - Screens for \(1 \times 1\) icons: \( \lceil 1 / 15 \rceil = 1 \)
  - Total screens: \(1\)

- For the sixth test case: \(x = 8\), \(y = 1\)
  - \( \text{Screens for } 2 \times 2 \text{ icons} = \lceil 1 / 2 \rceil = 1 \)
  - Remaining \(1 \times 1\) icons after placing \(2 \times 2\) icons: \(8 - 1 \times 4 = 4\)
  - Screens for \(1 \times 1\) icons: \( \lceil 4 / 15 \rceil = 1 \)
  - Total screens: \(1 + 1 = 2\)

- For the seventh test case: \(x = 0\), \(y = 0\)
  - Total screens: \(0\)

- For the eighth test case: \(x = 2\), \(y = 0\)
  - Screens for \(1 \times 1\) icons: \( \lceil 2 / 15 \rceil = 1 \)
  - Total screens: \(1\)

- For the ninth test case: \(x = 15\), \(y = 0\)
  - Screens for \(1 \times 1\) icons: \( \lceil 15 / 15 \rceil = 1 \)
  - Total screens: \(1\)

- For the tenth test case: \(x = 8\), \(y = 2\)
  - \( \text{Screens for } 2 \times 2 \text{ icons} = \lceil 2 / 2 \rceil = 1 \)
  - Remaining \(1 \times 1\) icons after placing \(2 \times 2\) icons: \(8 - 1 \times 4 = 4\)
  - Screens for \(1 \times 1\) icons: \( \lceil 4 / 15 \rceil = 1 \)
  - Total screens: \(1 + 1 = 2\)

- For the eleventh test case: \(x = 0\), \(y = 9\)
  - \( \text{Screens for } 2 \times 2 \text{ icons} = \lceil 9 / 2 \rceil = 5 \)
  - Total screens: \(5\)

### Conclusion
After re-evaluating the program, the logic appears to be correct. The program correctly calculates the number of screens needed for each test case based on the provided logic. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
