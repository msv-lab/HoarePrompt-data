Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `ap` is an input integer, `k` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer. Since both the if and else parts do not change the values of `t`, `ap`, `k`, `x`, and `y`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.**
