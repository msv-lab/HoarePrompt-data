Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `ap` is an input integer, `k` must be between 0 and `ap`-1 (inclusive), `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`, where `bxsfory` is the ceiling value of `y` divided by 2, and `bxsfory1` is 0 if `x` <= 0 else the ceiling value of `x` divided by 15 if `x > 0` and `y > 0`. If `x` is less than or equal to 0 or `y` is greater than 0, `x` remains unchanged.
