Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an input integer.
- `arr` is a string input by the user.
- `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' based on certain conditions, but these conditions are not specified in the initial state.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print(i)
```

Given the information, there is no variable named `i` mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the value of `i` is unknown and cannot be determined from the given information.

Output: **i (where i is an undefined variable)**
