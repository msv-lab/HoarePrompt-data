Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive); `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = input()
    if n % 2 == 0:
        results.append('no')
    elif arr.count('U') > arr.count('D'):
        results.append('yes')
    else:
        results.append('no')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no', `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `arr` is the string input by the user, and depending on whether `n` is even or odd and the count of 'U' in `arr` is greater than the count of 'D', `results` will contain 'yes' or 'no'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no', `i` is 2, `n` is an integer input by the user, `arr` is the string input by the user. If `n` is even, `results` contains 'no'. Otherwise, if the count of 'U' in `arr` is greater than the count of 'D', `results` contains 'yes' and either 'yes' or 'no'. If the count of 'D' is greater than or equal to the count of 'U', `results` contains 'no'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the string input by the user, and `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' based on whether the count of 'U' in `arr` is greater than the count of 'D'. If `n` is even, the list remains as ['no']. Otherwise, the list is updated to contain 'yes' or 'no' based on the count comparison.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
