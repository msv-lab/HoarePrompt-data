Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an input integer.
- `arr` is a string input by the user.
- `results` is a list containing at least two elements.
- `i` is the second-to-last element in the list `results`.

The code snippet `print(i)` will print the second-to-last element of the list `results`.

Since the exact values of `results` are not specified, we can only describe `i` in terms of its position in the list.

Output: **the second-to-last element in the list `results`**
