Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no', `i` is 2, `n` is an integer input by the user, `arr` is the string input by the user. If the count of 'U' in `arr` is greater than the count of 'D', then `results` contains 'yes' and either 'yes' or 'no'. Otherwise, `results` contains 'no'.
