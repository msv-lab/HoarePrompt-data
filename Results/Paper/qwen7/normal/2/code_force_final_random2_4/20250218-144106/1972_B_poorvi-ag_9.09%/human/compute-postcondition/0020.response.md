Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no', `i` is 1, `n` is an integer input by the user, `arr` is the string input by the user, `n` is an integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `results`, `i`, and `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
