The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is taken from the `results` list. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements left in the `results` list.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- `n` is an input integer
- `arr` is the string input by the user
- `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions described

For the loop to execute one more time, the `results` list must still contain at least one element.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `results` still contains at least one element.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `arr` is the string input by the user, `results` is a list containing at least one element**
