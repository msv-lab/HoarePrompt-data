Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in results:`. The only variable involved here is `i`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since the loop iterates over each element in `results`, the initial value of `i` will be the first element in `results`.

3. **Understand the Contents of `results`**: Based on the postconditions provided:
   - If `n` is even, `results` contains 'no'.
   - If `n` is odd and the count of 'U' in `arr` is greater than the count of 'D', `results` contains 'yes'.
   - If `n` is odd and the count of 'D' is greater than or equal to the count of 'U', `results` contains 'no'.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `results` is correctly initialized based on the given conditions.
   - The initial value of `i` will be the first element in `results`.

Given these points, let's formulate the state adjustments:

- `n` determines the content of `results`.
- `arr` is used to determine the content of `results` when `n` is odd.

Since the loop will iterate over each element in `results`, the initial state of `i` should be the first element in `results`.

### Adjusted States:
- `n` must be such that `results` is correctly initialized.
- `arr` must be such that the content of `results` is determined correctly based on the conditions.

Therefore, the state before the loop should be:

**State: `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the string input by the user, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' for each iteration based on the condition where if `n` is even, `results` contains 'no', otherwise if `n` is odd and the count of 'U' in `arr` is greater than the count of 'D', `results` contains 'yes', and if the count of 'D' is greater than or equal to the count of 'U', `results` contains 'no'. The first element of `results` is the initial value of `i`.** 

In a more concise format:

**State: `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the string input by the user, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' for each iteration based on the condition, the first element of `results` is the initial value of `i`.**
