Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(t)`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `t`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < t`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
   - `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no'.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an integer.
   - `arr` is the string input by the user.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, after the first iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `t`. Therefore, `t` remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `total` is not mentioned, so it remains unchanged.
   - `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
   - `t` remains the same as it did at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `results` remains unchanged.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `arr` remains unchanged.

Based on the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no', `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, `arr` is the string input by the user**.
