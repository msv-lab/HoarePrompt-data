Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `results` is a list containing 'yes' and either 'yes' or 'no', `i` is 2, `n` is an integer input by the user, `arr` is the string input by the user**.

Explanation: The line `results.append('yes')` adds the string `'yes'` to the list `results`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `i` was initially set to 1 and no operation has altered its value, it remains 1 after the increment (though the increment itself is not explicitly shown, the next logical step would be `i += 1` which would make `i` equal to 2).
