Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 99 (since the loop runs from 0 to t-1), `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the string input by the user, and `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' for each iteration based on the condition. If `n` is even, `results` contains 'no'. Otherwise, if the count of 'U' in `arr` is greater than the count of 'D', `results` contains 'yes' and either 'yes' or 'no'. If the count of 'D' is greater than or equal to the count of 'U', `results` contains 'no'.
Code of the loop:
for i in results:
    print(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the string input by the user, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions described

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the string input by the user, `results` is a list containing at least one element

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the string input by the user, `results` is a list containing at least two elements, `i` is the second-to-last element in the list `results`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
