Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the provided code step-by-step to ensure it correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed to place the icons.

1. **Initialization**: The code reads the number of test cases, `n`, and then iterates over each test case.
2. **Reading Input**: For each test case, it reads two integers, `a` and `b`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.
3. **Calculating Initial Screen Requirement for 2x2 Icons**: 
   - `t = b`: This initializes `t` with the number of 2x2 icons.
   - If `b` is even, `t` is divided by 2 (since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and 4 cells can fit into 2x2 icons perfectly).
   - If `b` is odd, `t` is divided by 2 and incremented by 1 (to account for the extra space needed for the remaining 2x2 icon).

4. **Calculating Remaining Space and Placing 1x1 Icons**:
   - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`: This calculates the total number of cells available on `t` screens minus the cells already occupied by 2x2 icons.
   - If `t1 >= a`, it means there is enough space to place all 1x1 icons without needing additional screens.
   - If not, the remaining space `t2 = a - t1` needs to be calculated.
     - If `t2` is a multiple of 15, it means the remaining space can be fully utilized by placing 1x1 icons in full rows.
     - Otherwise, an additional screen is needed to accommodate the remaining space.

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - If `t1 >= a`, the number of screens needed is `t`.
   - Otherwise, the number of screens needed is `t + (t2 // 15 + 1)`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic of the code, it appears that the code correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed to place the icons. The logic accounts for the space occupied by 2x2 icons and ensures that any remaining space is optimally used by 1x1 icons.

Therefore, the provided code seems to be correct based on the problem description and the example provided.

Correctness: **True**
