Output State: **`t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t` is now equal to `b`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `b` is now an integer value of the original `b`, `a` is converted to an integer from the user input `a`, `t` is `t` divided by 2.**

This means that `t` has been updated to its integer division by 2, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
