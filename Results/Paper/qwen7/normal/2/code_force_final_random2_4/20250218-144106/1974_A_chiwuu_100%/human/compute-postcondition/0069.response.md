Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and pairs of non-negative integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99). For each test case, it returns a result based on the values of `x` and `y`.**

Given the constraints and the lack of specific logic details in the problem statement, the function seems to process multiple test cases, each containing `t`, `x`, and `y`. However, without more specific details on what the function does with `x` and `y`, the most accurate description is that it processes these parameters and returns a result for each test case.
