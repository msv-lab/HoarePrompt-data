Output State: **`t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t` is now equal to `b`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `b` is now an integer value of the original `b`, `a` is converted to an integer from the user input `a`, and `t` is equal to `t`.**

Explanation: The line `t = t` does not change the value of `t`; it simply reassigns `t` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
