Output State: **`t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t` is either equal to `b` // 2 or equal to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an integer, `t2` is `a - t1`, `t2` is not divisible by 15, `t` is `t + t2 // 15 + 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `t` by adding `t2 // 15 + 1` to its current value. Since `t2` is not divisible by 15, `t2 // 15` results in 0, and thus `t` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
