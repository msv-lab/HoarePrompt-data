Output State: **`t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t` is equal to `b // 2 + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `b` is an integer value of `b`, and `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15`, `t2` is equal to `a - t1`.**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.
- `t` is either `b / 2` or `b // 2 + 1` depending on whether `t % 2` is 0.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `b` is an integer value.
- `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`.

After executing `t = t + t2 // 15`, `t` is updated to its original value plus `t2` divided by 15 (integer division). The other variables remain unchanged.
