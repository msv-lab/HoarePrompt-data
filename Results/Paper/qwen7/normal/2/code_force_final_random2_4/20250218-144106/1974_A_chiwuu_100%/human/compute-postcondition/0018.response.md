Output State: **`t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t` is either equal to `b` // 2 or equal to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an integer, `t2` is `a - t1`, and `t1` is less than `a`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `t2` as `a - t1`. Given the initial conditions, `t1` remains unchanged and is still equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`. The value of `t` and `b` remain as they were initially, and `n` and `a` also remain unchanged. The condition that `t1` is less than `a` is preserved, and now `t2` is defined as `a - t1`.
