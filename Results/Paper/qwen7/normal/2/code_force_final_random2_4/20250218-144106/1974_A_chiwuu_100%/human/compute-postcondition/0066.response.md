Let's break down the initial state and the operations step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`
   - `t` is now equal to `b`
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1
   - `i` is incremented by 1
   - `b` is now an integer value of the original `b`
   - `a` is an integer value from user input
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, then `t` remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + (t2 // 15) + 1` if `t2 % 15 == 0`, or `t + (t2 // 15)` otherwise, where `t2 = a - t1`.

2. **Determine the Value of `t`:**
   - Since the final value of `t` depends on the conditions mentioned, we need to consider both cases:
     - Case 1: If `t1 >= a`, then `t` remains unchanged.
     - Case 2: If `t1 < a`, then `t` is updated based on the value of `t2`.

3. **Final Value of `t`:**
   - From the initial state, we know that `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` and `t = b`.
   - Therefore, `t1 = b * 15 - b * 4 = b * 11`.
   - If `b * 11 >= a`, then `t` remains `b`.
   - If `b * 11 < a`, then `t` is updated to `b + (a - b * 11) // 15 + 1` if `(a - b * 11) % 15 == 0`, or `b + (a - b * 11) // 15` otherwise.

Given this, the final value of `t` will be either `b` or `b + (a - b * 11) // 15 + 1` or `b + (a - b * 11) // 15` depending on the value of `a`.

Since the exact value of `a` is not provided, we can only describe the final value of `t` in terms of `b` and `a`.

Output: **b + (a - b * 11) // 15 + 1 if (a - b * 11) % 15 == 0, otherwise b + (a - b * 11) // 15 (where b is the integer value of the original b and a is the integer value from user input)**
