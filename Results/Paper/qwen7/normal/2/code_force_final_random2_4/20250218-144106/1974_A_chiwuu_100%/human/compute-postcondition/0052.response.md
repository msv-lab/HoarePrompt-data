Output State: **`t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t` is either equal to `b / 2` or `b // 2 + 1` depending on whether `t % 2` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `b` is now an integer value of the original `b`, `a` is converted to an integer from the user input `a`.**

Explanation: The code `b = int(b)` simply converts the variable `b` to an integer. Since `b` was already mentioned to be an integer value of `b`, this conversion does not change its value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
