Postcondition: `t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t` is now equal to `b`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `b` is now an integer value of the original `b`, `a` is an integer value from user input, and if `t1 >= a`, then `t` remains unchanged; otherwise, `t` is updated to `t + (t2 // 15) + 1` if `t2 % 15 == 0`, otherwise `t` is updated to `t + (t2 // 15)`.
