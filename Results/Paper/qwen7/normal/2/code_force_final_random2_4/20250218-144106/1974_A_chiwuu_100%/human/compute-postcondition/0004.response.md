Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer**.

Explanation: The code snippet `b = int(b)` converts the string `b` into an integer. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and the original string `b` are updated to reflect this conversion. The conditions and values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
