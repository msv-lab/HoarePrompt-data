Output State: The final value of `t` will be the maximum value it reaches during the loop's execution. This is because the loop continues to update `t` based on the conditions provided. Specifically, `t` is updated whenever `t1 < a`, and the updates are designed to increment `t` in steps that are either exactly or just over multiples of 15. After all iterations, `t` will reflect the highest value it achieved throughout the loop's execution, considering the constraints and updates applied.

The final state of `t` will also depend on the inputs `a` and `b` for each iteration, as well as the initial value of `t`. Since the loop processes each `a` and `b` pair independently and updates `t` accordingly, the final `t` will be the result of these updates across all iterations. If `t1 >= a` for any iteration, `t` remains unchanged for that iteration. Otherwise, `t` is incremented appropriately based on the difference `a - t1`.

The output state after the loop executes all iterations is thus the maximum value of `t` that `t` attains during the loop, given the initial conditions and the operations performed within the loop.
