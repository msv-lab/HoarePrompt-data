Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

3. **Update the state based on the loop head variables**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`, so `n` must remain the same for the loop to execute again.

4. **Check the other variables**:
   - `t1`, `t`, `b`, `t2`, and `a` are not part of the loop head, so their values do not change for the loop to continue.

Given this analysis, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

- `i` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration.
- `n` must remain the same for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t` is either equal to `b / 2` or `b // 2 + 1` depending on whether `t % 2` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `b` is an integer value of `b`, and if `t1 >= a`, then `t` is updated to `t + t2 // 15 + (t2 % 15 == 0)`, `t2` is equal to `a - t1`; otherwise, `t` remains unchanged.**
