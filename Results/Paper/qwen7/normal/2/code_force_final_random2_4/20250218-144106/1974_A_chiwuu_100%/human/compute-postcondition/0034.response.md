Output State: **`t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t` is equal to `b`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `b` is an integer value of `b`.**

Explanation: The code `t = b` assigns the value of `b` to `t`. The other variables (`t1`, `n`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `b` is also unchanged but is noted to be an integer.
