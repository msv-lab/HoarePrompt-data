### Reasoning

Let's re-examine the program and the logic step-by-step to identify any flaws and ensure the correctness.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case by reading two integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Calculating Minimum Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The program initializes `t` with the value of `b` (number of 2x2 icons).
   - If `b` is odd, it increments `t` by 1 to ensure enough space for all 2x2 icons. This is because a 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and if `b` is odd, one extra screen might be needed.
   - `t` is then adjusted to account for the total number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons: `t = t * 15 - b * 4`.

3. **Checking Remaining Space for 1x1 Icons:**
   - `t1` calculates the remaining space after placing all 2x2 icons: `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a` (number of 1x1 icons), then the current `t` is sufficient.
   - Otherwise, it calculates how many additional screens are needed to fit the remaining 1x1 icons: `t2 = a - t1`.
   - `t` is updated to include these additional screens:
     - If `t2` is divisible by 15, `t += t2 // 15`.
     - Otherwise, `t += t2 // 15 + 1`.

4. **Outputting Result:**
   - Finally, it prints the value of `t`, which represents the minimum number of screens needed.

#### Issues Identified

1. **Calculation of `t1`:**
   - The formula `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` is incorrect. The correct formula should be `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`, but this does not correctly account for the space left after placing the 2x2 icons. 

2. **Handling Remaining Space for 1x1 Icons:**
   - The logic for updating `t` when `t1 < a` is flawed. The calculation of `t2` and the subsequent updates to `t` do not correctly reflect the space available for 1x1 icons.

#### Correct Approach

To correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed, we should:
1. Calculate the number of full 2x2 icons that can fit in each screen.
2. Calculate the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons.
3. Determine how many additional screens are needed to fit the remaining 1x1 icons.

Here is a corrected approach:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        t = b
        if b % 2 == 1:
            t += 1
        t = (t * 4) // 15
        if (t * 4) < b * 4:
            t += 1
        t1 = (t * 15) - (b * 4)
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t += (a - t1 + 14) // 15
        print(t)
```

### Testing with Provided Examples

Let's verify the logic with some example inputs:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `1 1`
   - Calculation:
     - `t = 1` (since there is 1 2x2 icon)
     - `t = 1 // 2 + 1 = 1` (since 1 is odd)
     - `t1 = 1 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 11`
     - `t1 >= 1` is true, so `t = 1`
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `7 2`
   - Calculation:
     - `t = 2` (since there are 2 2x2 icons)
     - `t = 2 // 2 + 1 = 2` (since 2 is even)
     - `t1 = 2 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 22`
     - `t1 >= 7` is false, so `t2 = 7 - 22 = -15` (which means we need 2 more screens)
     - `t += -15 // 15 + 1 = 2 + 0 + 1 = 3`
   - Output: `3` (Incorrect, should be 2)

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `12 4`
   - Calculation:
     - `t = 4` (since there are 4 2x2 icons)
     - `t = 4 // 2 + 1 = 3` (since 4 is even)
     - `t1 = 3 * 15 - 4 * 4 = 31`
     - `t1 >= 12` is true, so `t = 3`
   - Output: `3` (Incorrect, should be 2)

### Conclusion

After analyzing the provided examples, it appears that the logic for calculating the minimum number of screens is still flawed. Specifically, the calculation for `t1` and the subsequent adjustments do not correctly account for the placement of 1x1 icons within the available space.

Therefore, the given program is **incorrect**.

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
