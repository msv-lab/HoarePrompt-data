Output State: **`t1` is equal to `t * 15 - b * 4`, `t` is either equal to `b / 2` or `b // 2 + 1` depending on whether `t % 2` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1, `b` is an integer value of `b`, and `t2` is equal to `a - t1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a - t1` to `t2`. The values of `t1`, `t`, `n`, `i`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states. The only new variable `t2` is introduced and its value is determined by subtracting `t1` from `a`.
