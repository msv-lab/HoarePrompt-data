#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and two binary strings a_{11}a_{12}…a_{1n} and a_{21}a_{22}…a_{2n} are provided, where each a_{ij} is either 0 or 1. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
        
    #State: Output State: `a` is a list containing five elements, where the first two elements are strings from the initial input, the third element is a new string from the second input, the fourth element is another new string from the third input, and the fifth element is the final input from the fourth iteration of the loop.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations (which is 2 times in this case), the list `a` will contain four inputs provided through the `input()` function, resulting in a list with five elements in total.
    s = []
    x = 0
    y = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1':
            y = i
        
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `a` is a list containing ['input1', 'input2', 'input3', 'input4'], `x` is 3, `y` is 3, `i` is 3, `n` is 4, and `s` is 'input1input21'.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `n` will be 4 (since the loop runs from `i` in `range(n - 1)`), and the loop has executed three times as described in the previous states. The conditions inside the loop did not change `x` and `y` further after the third iteration, so they remain at `x` is 3 and `y` is 3. The variable `i` reaches 3, which is the last index in the range. The string `s` is constructed as 'input1input21' based on the logic provided in the third iteration's description.
    t = 1
    for i in range(y, x):
        if a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `x` is 4, `i` is 4, `t` is 1, `a` is a list of lists where the second sublist contains at least 4 elements, `s` is a string 'input1input21'.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations (from `i` starting at 3 up to but not including `y` which is 3), the value of `i` reaches 4 without finding a match for the condition `a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]`. Therefore, the variable `t` remains 1, and the values of `x`, `i`, `a`, and `s` do not change from their last known state after the third iteration.
    print(s, sep='')
    #This is printed: input1input21
    print(t)
    #This is printed: 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t`, an integer `n`, and two binary strings `a_{1}` and `a_{2}`. It constructs a new string `s` based on certain conditions involving characters from `a_{1}` and `a_{2}`. Then, it checks for a specific substring pattern within `a_{2}` and calculates a length `t` based on the match. Finally, it prints the string `s` and the integer `t`.
