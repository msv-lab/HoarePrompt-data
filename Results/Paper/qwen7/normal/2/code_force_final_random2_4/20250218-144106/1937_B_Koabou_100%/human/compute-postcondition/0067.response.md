Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases internally. For each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), and two binary strings `a_{1}` and `a_{2}` of length `n`. The function returns a result based on the comparison of these binary strings for each test case.**

Note: The actual logic to compare the binary strings and determine the return value is not described here as per the given instructions.
