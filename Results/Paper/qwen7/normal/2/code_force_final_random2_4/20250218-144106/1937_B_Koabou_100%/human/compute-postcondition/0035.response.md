Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is a list containing `['input1', 'input2', 'input3', 'input4']`.
   - `x` is 2.
   - `y` is 1.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i` in `range(n - 1)`.
   - This means `i` ranges from 0 to `n-2`.

3. **Loop Body (Omitted):**
   - The loop body checks if `a[0][i + 1]` equals '1' and `a[1][i]` equals '0'.
   - If both conditions are met, `y` is set to 1.
   - Otherwise, the values of `x`, `y`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.

4. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.

5. **Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 3 (because `i` will increment to 3 in the next iteration).

6. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 3.
   - `n` must remain greater than 3 to allow the loop to continue.

7. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `a` remains unchanged: `['input1', 'input2', 'input3', 'input4']`.
   - `x` remains unchanged: 2.
   - `y` remains unchanged: 1.
   - `i` becomes 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`a` is a list containing ['input1', 'input2', 'input3', 'input4'], `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
