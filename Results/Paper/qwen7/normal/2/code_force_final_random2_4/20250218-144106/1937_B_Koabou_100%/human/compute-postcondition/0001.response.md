Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and two binary strings `a_{11}a_{12}…a_{1n}` and `a_{21}a_{22}…a_{2n}` are provided, where each `a_{ij}` is either 0 or 1; `a` is an empty list; `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, the binary strings, and `a`) remain unchanged.
