Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` is 4
- `i` is 4
- `t` is 1
- `a` is a list of lists where the second sublist contains at least 4 elements
- `s` is a string 'input1input21'

The code snippet is:
```python
print(t)
```

Since `t` is explicitly stated to be 1 in the initial state, the print statement will simply output the value of `t`.

Output: **1**
