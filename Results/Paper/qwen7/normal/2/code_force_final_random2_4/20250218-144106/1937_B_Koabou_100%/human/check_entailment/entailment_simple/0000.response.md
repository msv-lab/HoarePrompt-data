### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Implementation Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to find the lexicographically smallest string and count the number of paths that yield this string.
   - However, the implementation of `func_1` does not correctly handle the problem requirements:
     - It initializes an empty list `s` and two indices `x` and `y`.
     - It iterates through the grid to construct the lexicographically smallest string `s` and determine the starting point `x` and ending point `y`.
     - It then checks if the sub-string from `y` to `x` matches the constructed string `s` and updates the count `t` accordingly.
     - Finally, it prints the string `s` and the count `t`.

2. **Issues Identified**:
   - **Incorrect Construction of Lexicographically Smallest String**: The current implementation constructs the string `s` by taking the first part from the first row and the rest from the second row, which might not always yield the lexicographically smallest string. This is evident from the example provided.
   - **Incorrect Path Count Calculation**: The current implementation does not correctly count the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string. It only considers a single path and sets `t` to `x - i + 1`, which is incorrect.

3. **Expected Correct Implementation**:
   - The solution should use dynamic programming to find the lexicographically smallest string and count the number of such paths.
   - A DP table can be used to keep track of the minimum lexicographical string and the number of ways to achieve it for each cell.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the required functionality. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: **False**
