Reasoning:
1. The program should process multiple test cases as specified.
2. For each test case, it correctly reads the input values for `n` and the two binary strings `a[0]` and `a[1]`.
3. The logic for constructing the lexicographically smallest string `s` seems to be flawed. Specifically:
   - The program attempts to find a position where `a[0][i+1] == '0'` and `a[1][i] == '1'`, setting `y` to `i`. This is intended to find the first position where the path can go down.
   - The program then tries to find a position where `a[0][i+1] == '1'` and `a[1][i] == '0'`, setting `s` to a combination of parts of `a[0]` and `a[1]` up to `i`, and setting `x` to `i`. This is intended to find the first position where the path can go right.
   - However, these conditions do not cover all possible scenarios to ensure the lexicographically smallest path is chosen.
4. The program then constructs `s` by concatenating parts of `a[0]` and `a[1]` based on the positions `x` and `y`.
5. The program calculates `t` by checking a substring pattern in `a[2]`, which is not defined in the problem statement and does not seem to align with the goal of finding the number of paths yielding the lexicographically smallest string.
6. The program prints `s` and `t`, but `t` is not relevant to the problem as stated.

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield it. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
