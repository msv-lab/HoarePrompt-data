Postcondition: `x` is 4, `i` is 4, `t` is 1, `a` is a list of lists where the second sublist contains at least 4 elements, `s` is a string, and either `x` is 4, `i` is 4, `t` is 1, `a` is a list of lists where the second sublist contains at least 4 elements, `s` is a string, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or the else part does not change these variables.
