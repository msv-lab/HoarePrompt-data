Output State: **`a` is a list containing three elements, where the first two elements are strings from the initial input and the third element is a new string from the input.**

Explanation: The initial state of `a` is a list containing two string elements. The code snippet appends a new string (obtained from `input()`) to the list `a`. Therefore, after executing the code, `a` will have three elements: the original two strings plus the new string input by the user.
