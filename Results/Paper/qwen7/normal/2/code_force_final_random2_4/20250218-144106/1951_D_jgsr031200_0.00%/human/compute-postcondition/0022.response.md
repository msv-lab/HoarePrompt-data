Output State: **`costs` is a list containing the elements `n - k + 1` and `1`, `i` is 1, `h` is `n // 1 + curr`, `curr` is `n // 1**.

Explanation: The variable `h` is incremented by the value of `curr`. Given that `curr` is initially set to `n // 1`, which simplifies to `n` (since `n // 1` means integer division by 1), `h` is updated to `h + n`. All other variables (`costs`, `i`, and `curr`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
