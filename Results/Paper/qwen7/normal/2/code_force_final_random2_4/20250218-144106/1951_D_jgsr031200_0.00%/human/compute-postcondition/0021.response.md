Output State: **`costs` is a list containing the elements `n - k + 1` and `1`, `i` is 1, `curr` is `n // 1`**

Explanation: The code `curr = n // i` divides `n` by `i` using integer division. Given that `i` is initially 1, `n // i` is simply `n`. Therefore, `curr` is assigned the value of `n`. The lists `costs` and the variable `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
