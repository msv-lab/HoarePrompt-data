Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `costs`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the `costs` list.

3. **Analyze the given state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `costs` is a list containing the elements `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - `h` is increased by `n // i`.
   - `n` is decreased by `i * curr`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in `costs`, the value of `i` will be the next element in the list `costs`.
   - The list `costs` contains two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`. After the first iteration, `i` will be `1` (the second element in the list).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be set to `1` for the next iteration.
   - `h` will be increased by `n // 1` (which is `n`).
   - `n` will be decreased by `1 * curr` (which is `curr`).

Given these adjustments, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`costs` is a list containing the elements `n - k + 1` and `1`, `h` is increased by `n`, `n` is decreased by `curr`, `i` is 1**
