Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `costs` is a list containing the elements `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - `h` is equal to `n - (n - k + 1)`.
   - `n` is reduced to `k - 1`.
   - `h` is equal to `k - 1`.

2. **Values of Variables:**
   - Since `n` is reduced to `k - 1`, let's denote the new value of `n` as `n_new = k - 1`.
   - The first element of `costs` is `n - k + 1`. Substituting `n` with `k - 1`, we get `(k - 1) - k + 1 = k - k + 1 - 1 = 0`.
   - The second element of `costs` is `1`.
   - Therefore, `costs` is now a list `[0, 1]`.

3. **Code Execution:**
   - The code snippet is `print(*costs)`.
   - The `*` operator unpacks the list `costs` and prints its elements separated by spaces.

Based on the above steps, the output will be the elements of the list `costs` printed as `0 1`.

Output: **0 1**
