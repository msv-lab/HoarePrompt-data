Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `costs` is a list containing the elements `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - `h` is equal to `n - (n - k + 1)`.
   - `n` is reduced to `k - 1`.
   - `h` is equal to `k - 1`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(2)
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `costs` is a list with two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
- After the reduction, `n` becomes `k - 1`.
- Since `h` is updated to `k - 1`, it also equals `n`.

However, the print statement does not reference any of these variables. It simply prints the number `2`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **2**
