Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `costs` is a list containing two elements:
     - The first element is `n - k + 1`
     - The second element is `1`
   - `h` is equal to `k - 1`
   - `n` is equal to `k - 1`

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is simply `print('NO')`.

Given this information, the print statement will output the string `'NO'` directly.

Output: **'NO'**
