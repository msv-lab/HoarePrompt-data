### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the given program step-by-step:

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`.

2. **Base Case Handling**:
   - If `n == k`, the program prints "YES" and sets up 1 stall with a price of 1 coin. This is correct because Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels if the price is 1 coin and she has exactly `k` coins.
   
3. **Case When `n < k`**:
   - If `n < k`, the program prints "NO". This is correct because Alice cannot buy `k` jewels if she has fewer coins than `k`.

4. **Case When `n >= k`**:
   - If `n >= k`, the program initializes `costs` with `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - It then iterates over these costs, calculating how many jewels Alice can buy from each stall and updating `n` accordingly.
   - After the loop, it checks if the total number of stalls (`h`) is less than `k`. If so, it prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy exactly `k` jewels with the current setup.
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES" and sets up 2 stalls with prices `n - k + 1` and `1`.

However, there are issues with the logic and the output format:

- The logic for setting up the stalls is flawed. The program should ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, but the current implementation does not guarantee this.
- The output format for the case when `n >= k` is incorrect. It prints "2" instead of the number of stalls required, and the prices are incorrect.

### Corrected Logic:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. Hereâ€™s a corrected approach:

1. **Base Case**: If `n == k`, print "YES" and 1 stall with price 1.
2. **Case When `n < k`**: Print "NO".
3. **Case When `n >= k`**:
   - Use binary search to find the minimum number of stalls needed.
   - Ensure the total cost of jewels Alice can buy from these stalls equals `k`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
import math as m

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))

    def can_buy(jewels, stalls):
        total_cost = 0
        for i in range(stalls):
            total_cost += min(jewels, k - total_cost)
        return total_cost == k

    if n == k:
        print("YES")
        print(1)
        print(1)
    elif n < k:
        print("NO")
    else:
        low, high = 1, 60
        while low < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            if can_buy(n, mid):
                high = mid
            else:
                low = mid + 1
        print("YES")
        print(low)
        prices = []
        remaining_k = k
        for i in range(low):
            if remaining_k > 0:
                prices.append(min(n, remaining_k))
                remaining_k -= min(n, remaining_k)
        print(*prices)
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic and output format. The corrected program ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels and outputs the correct number of stalls and their prices.

**Correctness: False**
