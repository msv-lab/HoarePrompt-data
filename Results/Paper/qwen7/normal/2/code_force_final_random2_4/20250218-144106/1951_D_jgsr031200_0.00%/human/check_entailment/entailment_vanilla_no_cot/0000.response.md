Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Prices**: The function `func_1` attempts to use only two prices (`n - k + 1` and `1`) to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. However, this approach does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels, especially when `n` is significantly larger than `k`.

2. **Logic Flaws**: The logic in `func_1` does not correctly distribute the prices across multiple stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. It incorrectly assumes that using just two prices will work, which is not always the case.

3. **Output Format**: The output format is also incorrect. If the answer is "YES", the number of stalls should be printed first, followed by the prices. The current implementation prints the number of stalls before printing "YES".

### Correct Solution:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to distribute the prices across multiple stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    
    # Determine the number of stalls needed
    stalls = []
    current_jewels = 0
    for i in range(1, 61):
        if current_jewels + min(k - current_jewels, n // i) >= k:
            stalls.append(i)
            break
        else:
            stalls.append(i)
            current_jewels += min(k - current_jewels, n // i)
    
    # Ensure we have exactly 60 stalls
    if len(stalls) > 60:
        print("NO")
        continue
    
    # Calculate the prices for each stall
    prices = []
    remaining_jewels = k
    for i in stalls:
        price = n // remaining_jewels
        prices.append(price)
        remaining_jewels -= min(remaining_jewels, n // price)
    
    print("YES")
    print(len(stalls))
    print(" ".join(map(str, prices)))
```

This solution ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by distributing the prices across up to 60 stalls.
