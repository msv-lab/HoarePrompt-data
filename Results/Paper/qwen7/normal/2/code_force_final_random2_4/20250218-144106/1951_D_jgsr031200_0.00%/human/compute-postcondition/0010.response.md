Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^{18} and n ≥ k; `k` is a positive integer; `costs` is a list containing two elements: the first element is `n - k + 1`, and the second element is `1`.**

This means that the variable `n` and `k` retain their initial conditions where `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` remains unchanged. The new list `costs` is initialized with two elements: the first element is the value of `n - k + 1`, and the second element is `1`.
