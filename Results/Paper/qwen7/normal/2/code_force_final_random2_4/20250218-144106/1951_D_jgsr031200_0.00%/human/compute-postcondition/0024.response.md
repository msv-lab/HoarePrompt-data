Output State: `costs` is a list containing the elements `n - k + 1` and `1`, `h` is equal to `n`, `n` is equal to `0`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `h` accumulates the value of `n` because `curr` is always equal to `n` (as `n // i` where `i` is either `n - k + 1` or `1`), and `n` is reduced to `0` by subtracting `i * curr` each iteration until `n` is fully consumed.
