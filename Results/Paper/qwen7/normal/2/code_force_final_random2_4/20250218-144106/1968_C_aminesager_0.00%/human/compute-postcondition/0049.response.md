Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is `[T[0] - a[0], T[1] - a[1], ..., T[n-3] - a[n-3], T[n-2] - a[n-2]]`, `result` is a string that contains the elements of `a` separated by spaces, `t` is `t - 1` and `t` must be non-zero, `line` is the input string, `T` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `result = ' '.join(map(str, a))` joins the elements of the list `a` into a single string where each element is converted to a string and separated by a space. The values of `i`, `n`, `t`, `line`, and `T` remain unchanged. The value of `a` is updated to contain the differences between corresponding elements of `T` and `a`. The `result` variable is now a string containing these differences separated by spaces.
