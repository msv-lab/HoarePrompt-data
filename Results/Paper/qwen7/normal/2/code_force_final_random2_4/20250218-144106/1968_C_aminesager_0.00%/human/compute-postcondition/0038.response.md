Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list where the first element `a[0]` is `1000 - (T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2])`, and every subsequent element `a[j]` (for `j` from 1 to `n-2`) is `a[j-1] - T[j-1]`, and the list `a` is reversed; `result` is a string obtained by joining the elements of the list `a` with spaces; `t` is `t - 1` and `t` must be non-zero; `line` is the input string**.

Explanation: The code reads an input line using `input()`. This input is stored in the variable `line`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
