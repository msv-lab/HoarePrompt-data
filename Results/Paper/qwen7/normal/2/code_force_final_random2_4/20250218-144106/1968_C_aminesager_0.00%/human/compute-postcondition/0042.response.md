Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` must be at least 2, `a` is `[1000, a[i-1] - T[i-1]]`, `result` is an empty string, `t` is `t - 1` and `t` must be non-zero, `line` is the input string, `T` is an empty list**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `i` is `n-1`. After executing `a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])`, `i` is decremented by 1, so `i` becomes `n-2`.
- The value of `a` is updated by appending `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]` to the existing list `[1000]`. Since `i` was initially `n-1`, `a[i - 1]` refers to `a[n-2]`, which is `1000` (the first element of the list). Thus, `a` becomes `[1000, 1000 - T[n-2]]`.
- All other variables (`n`, `result`, `t`, `line`, and `T`) remain unchanged.
