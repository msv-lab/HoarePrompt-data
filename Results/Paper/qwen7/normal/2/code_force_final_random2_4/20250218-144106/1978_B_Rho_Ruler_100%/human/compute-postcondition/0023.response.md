Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `mid` which is equal to (`low` + `high`) // 2, `high` is greater than or equal to `mid`, `profit_mid` and `profit_next` remain unchanged, and `max_profit` remains unchanged.**

This means that the variable `mid` has been updated to the midpoint between `low` and `high` using integer division, while the other variables (`low`, `high`, `profit_mid`, `profit_next`, and `max_profit`) retain their original values and conditions.
