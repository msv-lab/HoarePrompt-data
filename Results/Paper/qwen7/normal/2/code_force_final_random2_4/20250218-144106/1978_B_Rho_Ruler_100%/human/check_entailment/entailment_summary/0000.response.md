Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires finding the maximum profit Bob can make by choosing an optimal number of buns to sell at a modified price.
2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**: 
   - This function calculates the profit for a given `k` (number of buns sold at the modified price).
   - The formula used is `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`, which correctly computes the total profit considering the first `k` buns are sold at `b` coins each and the remaining `n - k` buns are sold at `a` coins each.
3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function uses a binary search approach to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - It initializes the search range from `0` to `min(n, b)` and iteratively narrows down the range until the optimal `k` is found.
   - The binary search ensures that the solution space is efficiently explored, and the function correctly updates the `max_profit` variable to keep track of the highest profit encountered.
4. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - Both functions work together to solve the problem as described.
   - `func_1` provides the necessary profit calculation for any given `k`, and `func_2` uses this to find the best `k` through binary search.
   - The logic and formulas used in both functions align with the problem statement and examples provided.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit for selling buns under the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
