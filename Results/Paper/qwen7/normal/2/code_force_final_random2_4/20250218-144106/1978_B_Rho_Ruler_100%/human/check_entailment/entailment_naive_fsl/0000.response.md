Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns under the given promotion rules. The `func_2` function iteratively calculates the profit for different values of \( k \) using the helper function `func_1`, which computes the profit for a given \( k \). The function uses binary search to efficiently find the optimal \( k \) that maximizes the profit. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the provided solution handles all potential cases correctly, ensuring that the maximum possible profit is always determined.
