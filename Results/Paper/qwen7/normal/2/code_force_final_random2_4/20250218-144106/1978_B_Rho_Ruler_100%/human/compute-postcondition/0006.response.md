Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is at least 0, `max_profit` is the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`, `mid` is (low + high) // 2, `profit_next` is the return value of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`**

Explanation: The line `max_profit = max(max_profit, profit_mid)` updates the value of `max_profit` to be the maximum of its current value and `profit_mid`. The other variables (`low`, `high`, `mid`, and `profit_next`) remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
