The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`. Here, `n` is an integer representing the number of buns, `a` is an integer representing the usual price of a bun, and `b` is an integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price. Additionally, the constraints are 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9, and 0 ≤ b ≤ min(n, b). The function returns the highest profit (`max_profit`) found during the iterations, with `low` being the final lower bound and `high` being the final upper bound which is either `low` or one step above it.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, a, and b, and returns the highest profit found during the iterations along with the final lower and upper bounds.**
