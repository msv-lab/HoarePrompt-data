Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `low <= high`.
2. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The variables involved in the loop head are `low`, `high`, `max_profit`, `mid`, and `profit_next`.
3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, then `low` becomes `mid` + 1, `profit_mid` is updated to `profit_next`, and `mid` is updated to `(mid + 1) // 2`.
   - Otherwise, `high` becomes `mid` - 1, and `profit_mid` remains unchanged.

For the loop to continue, the condition `low <= high` must still hold true. We need to ensure that this condition is met after the adjustments made inside the loop.

### Analysis:
- **Case 1**: `profit_next > profit_mid`
  - `low` becomes `mid` + 1
  - `high` remains unchanged
  - `profit_mid` becomes `profit_next`
  - `mid` becomes `(mid + 1) // 2`

  For the loop to continue, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`:
  \[
  \text{mid} + 1 \leq \text{high}
  \]
  Since `mid = (\text{low} + \text{high}) // 2`, we can substitute:
  \[
  \text{mid} + 1 \leq \text{high} \implies \left(\frac{\text{low} + \text{high}}{2}\right) + 1 \leq \text{high}
  \]
  Simplifying:
  \[
  \frac{\text{low} + \text{high}}{2} + 1 \leq \text{high} \implies \frac{\text{low} + \text{high} + 2}{2} \leq \text{high} \implies \text{low} + \text{high} + 2 \leq 2\text{high} \implies \text{low} + 2 \leq \text{high}
  \]

- **Case 2**: `profit_next <= profit_mid`
  - `low` remains unchanged
  - `high` becomes `mid` - 1
  - `profit_mid` remains unchanged
  - `mid` becomes `(low + high) // 2`

  For the loop to continue, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`:
  \[
  \text{low} \leq \text{mid} - 1
  \]
  Since `mid = (\text{low} + \text{high}) // 2`, we can substitute:
  \[
  \text{low} \leq \left(\frac{\text{low} + \text{high}}{2}\right) - 1
  \]
  Simplifying:
  \[
  \text{low} \leq \frac{\text{low} + \text{high}}{2} - 1 \implies 2\text{low} \leq \text{low} + \text{high} - 2 \implies \text{low} \leq \text{high} - 2
  \]

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop continues, either:
- `low + 2 <= high` must hold true (from Case 1)
- `low <= high - 2` must hold true (from Case 2)

Given the initial state where `low`, `high`, `max_profit`, `mid`, and `profit_next` are updated accordingly, we need to ensure that the loop condition `low <= high` holds true.

### Final Answer:
State: **`low` is such that `low + 2 <= high` or `low` is such that `low <= high - 2`**
