Postcondition: **`low` is less than or equal to `mid`, `mid` is equal to (`low` + `high`) // 2, `high` is greater than or equal to `mid`, `max_profit` is the maximum of `max_profit` and `profit_mid`, `profit_mid` remains unchanged, `profit_next` is the result of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`, if `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1`, otherwise `high` is updated to `mid - 1**.
