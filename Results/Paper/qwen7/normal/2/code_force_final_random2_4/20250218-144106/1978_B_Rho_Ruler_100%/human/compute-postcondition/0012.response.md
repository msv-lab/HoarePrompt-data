Postcondition: `low`, `high`, `max_profit`, `mid`, and `profit_next` are as follows:
- If `profit_next` is greater than `profit_mid`, then `low` is updated to `mid` + 1, `profit_mid` is updated to `profit_next`, and `mid` is updated to `(mid + 1) // 2`.
- Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid` - 1, and `mid` remains unchanged.
