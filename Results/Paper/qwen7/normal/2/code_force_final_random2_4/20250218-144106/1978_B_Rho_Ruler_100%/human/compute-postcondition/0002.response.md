The variables in the loop head are `low` and `high`. According to the code, the loop condition is `low <= high`. Right before the loop, `low` is 0, and `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`.

For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `low <= high` must be true. Since `low` is already 0, `high` must be at least 0 for the loop to proceed.

Therefore, the state of `high` needs to be adjusted to ensure that `high` is at least 0.

State: **`low` is 0, `high` is at least 0, `max_profit` is 0**
