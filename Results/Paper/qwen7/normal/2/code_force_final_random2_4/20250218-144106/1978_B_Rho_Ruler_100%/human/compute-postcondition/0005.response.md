Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is at least 0, `max_profit` is 0, `mid` is (low + high) // 2, `profit_next` is the return value of `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `profit_next` by assigning it the return value of the function `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`. The values of `low`, `high`, `max_profit`, and `mid` remain unchanged from their initial states.
