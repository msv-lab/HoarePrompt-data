Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns under a specific pricing strategy. The key is to find the optimal number of buns (`k`) to sell at the modified price `b - i + 1` for the first `k` buns and the usual price `a` for the remaining buns.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function calculates the profit for a given `k` by summing up the modified prices for the first `k` buns and the usual prices for the remaining buns.
   - The formula used is \( k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a \).
   - This formula correctly accounts for the arithmetic series sum for the modified prices and the usual prices for the remaining buns.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function uses a binary search approach to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to `min(n, b)`.
   - It iteratively narrows down the range `[low, high]` to find the `mid` that gives the maximum profit.
   - For each `mid`, it calculates the profit using `func_1(mid, n, a, b)` and compares it with the profit for `mid + 1`.
   - The binary search ensures that the optimal `k` is found efficiently.
   - The final `max_profit` returned is the highest profit found during the iterations.

4. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The program correctly reads the input and calls `func_2` for each test case.
   - `func_2` correctly implements the binary search to find the optimal `k` and returns the maximum profit.
   - The logic and calculations in both functions are consistent with the problem statement and the expected behavior.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
