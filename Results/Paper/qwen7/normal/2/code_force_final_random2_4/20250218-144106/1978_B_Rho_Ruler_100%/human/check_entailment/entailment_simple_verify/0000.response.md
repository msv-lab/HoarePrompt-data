### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`:
This function calculates the profit for a given \( k \) using the formula:
\[ \text{Profit} = k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a \]

This formula accounts for:
- Selling the first \( k \) buns at a modified price of \( b - i + 1 \) coins each.
- Selling the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price \( a \).

The formula is derived from:
- Sum of the first \( k \) terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from \( b \) with a common difference of -1.
- Sum of the remaining \( n - k \) terms at the usual price \( a \).

#### Function `func_2`:
This function uses binary search to find the optimal \( k \) that maximizes the profit. It iteratively narrows down the range of possible \( k \) values between 0 and \( \min(n, b) \).

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `low` is set to 0.
   - `high` is set to \( \min(n, b) \).
   - `max_profit` is initialized to 0.

2. **Binary Search Loop**:
   - Calculate the midpoint `mid`.
   - Compute the profit for `mid` using `func_1(mid, n, a, b)`.
   - Compute the profit for `mid + 1` using `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`.

3. **Update `max_profit`**:
   - Update `max_profit` with the maximum of the current `max_profit` and the profit at `mid`.

4. **Adjust Search Range**:
   - If the profit at `mid + 1` is greater than the profit at `mid`, move the lower bound `low` up to `mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, move the upper bound `high` down to `mid - 1`.

5. **Return `max_profit`**:
   - After the loop ends, `max_profit` contains the maximum profit found.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the binary search approach ensures that the optimal \( k \) is found efficiently. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the profit for any given \( k \), and the binary search in `func_2` ensures that the maximum profit is determined accurately.

The provided solution handles all potential cases correctly, ensuring that the maximum possible profit is always determined.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns under the given promotion rules.
