Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000, and each integer in the list is unique and ranges from 1 to `n`, appearing at most twice. The function returns an integer indicating the count of unique elements in the list.**
