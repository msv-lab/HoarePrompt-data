Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the solution for the problem. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the cost of installing supports for a single row.
   - It ensures that the cost of installing supports at the beginning and end of the row is always 1 (since they are mandatory).
   - For each cell in the row (starting from the second cell), it finds the minimum cost of the previous `d` cells and adds 1 to it. This ensures that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function processes the input and computes the minimum total cost for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows.
   - It reads the dimensions and the grid from the input.
   - It then applies `func_1` to each row to get the cost of installing supports for that row.
   - Finally, it iterates through the list of costs for each possible starting row for the bridges and calculates the total cost for each set of `k` consecutive rows, keeping track of the minimum total cost.

The logic and implementation in both functions align with the problem statement and constraints. The program correctly handles the requirements and guarantees the minimum total cost for installing supports across multiple rows.
