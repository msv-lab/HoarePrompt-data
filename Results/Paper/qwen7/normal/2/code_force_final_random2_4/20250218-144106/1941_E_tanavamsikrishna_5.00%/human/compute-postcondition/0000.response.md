Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces; rows is still a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` positive integers representing the depths of the river cells. The first and last elements of each inner list are guaranteed to be 0.**

The code reads four integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`. It does not modify the `rows` list, so it remains unchanged. The precondition that the first and last elements of each inner list in `rows` are guaranteed to be 0 is still valid.
