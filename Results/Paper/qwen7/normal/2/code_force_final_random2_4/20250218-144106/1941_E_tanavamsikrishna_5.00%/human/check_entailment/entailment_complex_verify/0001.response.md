### Reasoning

Let's systematically evaluate the provided program based on the given problem description and the annotated code.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initial State**: `row` is a list of non-negative integers representing the depths of river cells in a row, and `d` is a positive integer representing the maximum allowed distance between adjacent supports.
2. **First Loop**: This loop increments the first `d-1` elements of `row` by their respective indices.
3. **Second Loop**: This loop updates the remaining elements of `row` starting from index `d-1` to the end. For each element `row[i]` (where `i >= d-1`), it sets the value to the minimum value of the previous `d+1` elements plus 1. This ensures that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.

The function returns the last element of the updated `row`, which represents the total cost of placing supports in that row.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Input Reading**: Reads the dimensions `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` for each test case. It also reads `n` rows of depths.
2. **Cost Calculation**: For each row, it calls `func_1` to calculate the cost of placing supports.
3. **Total Cost Calculation**: It calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and stores these sums in `total_costs`.
4. **Minimum Total Cost**: It finds the minimum total cost among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows and prints it.

### Verification of Correctness

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly handles the constraints of the problem. It ensures that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d` by updating the values appropriately.
   - The final cost returned by `func_1` is correct because it follows the dynamic programming approach to ensure the minimum cost is calculated.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly processes each test case by reading the input, calculating the cost for each row using `func_1`, and then finding the minimum cost for any `k` consecutive rows.
   - The use of slicing (`costs[i:i + k]`) to get the cost of `k` consecutive rows and then summing them up is appropriate.
   - The final step of finding the minimum total cost among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows is correct.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. There are no logical errors or inefficiencies that would make the program incorrect.
