Output State: **`rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` integers (depths of the river cells), and the first and last elements of each inner list are 0; `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code creates a list of lists named `rows`. Each inner list contains `m` integers representing the depths of the river cells. The first and last elements of each inner list are guaranteed to be 0. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces. The values of `k` and `d` remain unchanged, and `n` and `m` are updated based on the input.
