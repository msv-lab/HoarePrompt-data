Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information
- **State at the end of the previous iteration**: 
  - `total_costs` now contains the sum of costs from index `i` to `i + k - 1`.
  - `i` and `k` retain their previous values.

- **For Loop Statement**:
  ```python
  for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from `0` to `len(costs) - k`.
   - This means the loop will continue as long as `i < len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

2. **Variables in the Loop Head**:
   - The only variables involved in the loop condition are `i` and `k`.

3. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `i` and `k` retain their previous values, we need to update `i` to `i + 1` for the next iteration.
   - The variable `total_costs` is updated within the loop body but its state at the end of the previous iteration is given.

### Updated State
- `total_costs` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `i` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
- `k` remains unchanged.

### Final State
State: **`total_costs` now contains the sum of costs from index `i + 1` to `i + k`, and `i` is `i + 1` and `k` retains its previous value.**

This can be written as:
State: **`total_costs` now contains the sum of costs from index `i + 1` to `i + k`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `k` retains its previous value.**
