Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The value of `i` is `d-1`; each element `row[i]` from index 0 to `d-2` has been incremented by its respective index value (i.e., `row[0]` is incremented by 0, `row[1]` by 1, ..., `row[d-2]` by `d-2`).

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have the value `d-1`, and each element in the `row` list from index 0 up to `d-2` will have been incremented by its own index value.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):
    row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `d - 1`, `d` must be less than or equal to the length of `row`, and the elements from index 0 to `d-2` in `row` have already been incremented by their respective index values, `row[i]` is updated to the minimum value of the slice `row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]` plus its original value plus 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The value of `row[i]` is updated to be the minimum value of `row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]` plus 1, if `i` is greater than 0; otherwise, it is set to 0 plus the original value of `row[i]` plus 1. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `row[i]` is updated to be the minimum value of `row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]` plus 1 if `i` is greater than 0; otherwise, it is set to 0 plus the original value of `row[i]` plus 1, `i` is `k+1`, `d` is the same as before, and all other variables and their values remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
