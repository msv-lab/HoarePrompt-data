Output State: **`total_costs` now contains the sum of costs from index `i` to `i + k - 1`, and `i` and `k` retain their previous values.**

Explanation: The code appends the sum of the slice of the `costs` list from index `i` to `i + k - 1` to the `total_costs` list. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged, while `total_costs` gains a new element which is the sum of the specified slice of `costs`.
