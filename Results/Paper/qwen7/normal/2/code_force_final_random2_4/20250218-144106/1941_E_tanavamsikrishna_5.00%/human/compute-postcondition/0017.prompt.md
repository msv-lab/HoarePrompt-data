You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: row is a list of non-negative integers representing the depths of river cells in a row, and d is a positive integer representing the maximum allowed distance between adjacent supports.
def func_1(row, d):
    for i in range(0, d - 1):
        row[i] = row[i] + 1
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `i` is `d-1`; each element `row[i]` from index 0 to `d-2` has been incremented by its respective index value (i.e., `row[0]` is incremented by 0, `row[1]` by 1, ..., `row[d-2]` by `d-2`).
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have the value `d-1`, and each element in the `row` list from index 0 up to `d-2` will have been incremented by its own index value.
    for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):
        row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1
        
    #State: The value of `i` is `len(row)`, each element `row[i]` from index 0 to `len(row)-1` has been updated to the minimum value of the slice `row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]` plus 1, if `i` is greater than 0; otherwise, it is set to 0 plus the original value of `row[i]` plus 1.
    return row[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of the list 'row', which has been updated according to the specified rules.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: a list of non-negative integers named `row` and a positive integer named `d`. It updates the last element of the list `row` based on specified rules and returns the updated last element.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the last element of the list 'row', which has been updated according to the specified rules.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
