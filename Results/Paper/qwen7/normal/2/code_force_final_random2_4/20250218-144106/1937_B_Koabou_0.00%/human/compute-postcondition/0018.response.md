Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, the first element of `a` at index 0 has its second element equal to '0', the first element of `a` at index 1 has its 0-th element equal to '0', and either the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'`.
