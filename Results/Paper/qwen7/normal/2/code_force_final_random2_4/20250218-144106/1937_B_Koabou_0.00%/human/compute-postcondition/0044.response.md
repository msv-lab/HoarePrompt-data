Postcondition: `i` is 3, `x` must be greater than 0, `s` is a string slice from `a[0]` from index 0 to index 3 (inclusive) concatenated with a slice from `a[1]` starting from index 2, `t` is 2. If `a[0][:4]` equals `s[:4]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If not, no change occurs to the variables.
