Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state is given as follows:
   - `i` is 5
   - `x` is 5
   - `s` is 'aaa2'
   - `t` is 1

2. The `print` statement is `print(s, sep='')`.

3. In Python, the `sep=''` parameter in the `print` function specifies the separator between the arguments being printed. When `sep=''`, it means no separator is used between the arguments.

4. The argument `s` is the string 'aaa2'.

5. Since there are no other arguments in the `print` function, only `s` is printed.

6. Therefore, the output will be the string 'aaa2'.

Output: **aaa2**
