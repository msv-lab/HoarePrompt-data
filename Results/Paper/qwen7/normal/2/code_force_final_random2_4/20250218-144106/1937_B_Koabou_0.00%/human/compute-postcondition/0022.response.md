Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, the first element of `a` at index 0 has its second element equal to '01', and the first element of `a` at index 1 has its 0-th element equal to '0'**.

Explanation: The code `x = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 1) to `x`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
