#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and two binary strings a_{11}a_{12}…a_{1n} and a_{21}a_{22}…a_{2n} are provided, where each a_{ij} is either 0 or 1. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
        
    #State: `a` is a list with two elements: the first element is the original element from the initial state, and the second element is the input from the user entered during the third iteration of the loop.
    s = []
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `x` is 2, `s` is a string slice from `a[0]` from index 0 to index 3 (inclusive) concatenated with a slice from `a[1]` starting from index 2, and `n` is at least 4.
    t = 1
    for i in range(x):
        if a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
        
    #State: i is 5, x is 5, s is 'aaa2', t is 1.
    print(s, sep='')
    #This is printed: aaa2
    print(t)
    #This is printed: 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and two binary strings \( a_1 \) and \( a_2 \). For each test case, it finds a substring in \( a_1 \) that matches a prefix in \( a_2 \) and returns the length of the longest matching prefix. If no match is found, it returns 1. The function prints the matched substring and the length of the longest matching prefix.
