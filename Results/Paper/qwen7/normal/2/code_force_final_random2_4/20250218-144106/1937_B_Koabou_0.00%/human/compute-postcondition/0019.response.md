Postcondition: `i` is 0, `x` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the first element of `a` at index 0 has its second element equal to '0', and the first element of `a` at index 1 has its 0-th element equal to '0'. If `a[0][i + 1]` equals '1' and `a[1][i]` equals '0', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
