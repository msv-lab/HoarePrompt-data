Reasoning:
1. The program correctly initializes variables and iterates over the input string to calculate the balance at each position.
2. The balance and position information are stored in the `details` list as tuples.
3. The `details` list is sorted based on the balance values, with a secondary sort on the negative index to handle ties.
4. The sorted characters are then joined to form the result string.
5. Given the problem description and the provided example, the program logic aligns with the definition of the balanced shuffle operation.
6. The final output matches the expected result for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
