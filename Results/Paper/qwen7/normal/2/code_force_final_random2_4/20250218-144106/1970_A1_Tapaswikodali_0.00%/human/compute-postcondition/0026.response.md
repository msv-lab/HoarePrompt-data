Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(", and ")". 
- `balance` is either 1 or -1.
- `details` is a list containing tuples for each character in the string `s`.
- `result` is the string formed by joining the third element of each tuple in `details` based on the sorted order of the first element (balance) and second element (-i).

Let's break down the steps:

1. Each character in `s` is represented in `details` as a tuple where:
   - The first element is `balance` (either 1 or -1).
   - The second element is the index `-i` of the character in `s` (since `i` would be the index starting from 0, `-i` would be the negative index).
   - The third element is the character itself ("(" or ")").

2. The `result` is formed by joining the third element of each tuple in `details` based on the sorted order of the first element (balance) and second element (-i).

Given that `balance` is either 1 or -1, and considering the nature of the sorting (first by balance, then by -i), the tuples will be sorted such that all tuples with `balance = 1` come before those with `balance = -1`.

For example, if `s = "(()"`, then `details` might look like this:
- For "(": `balance = 1`, `-i = -0`, so one tuple is `(1, -0, "(")`
- For ")": `balance = -1`, `-i = -1`, so another tuple is `(-1, -1, ")")`

Sorted by `balance` and `-i`, the tuples would be:
- `(1, -0, "(")`
- `(-1, -1, ")")`

Joining the third elements of these tuples results in the string `"(())"`.

Therefore, the `print(result)` statement will print the string formed by joining the third element of each tuple in `details` based on the specified sorting criteria.

Output: **"(())"**
