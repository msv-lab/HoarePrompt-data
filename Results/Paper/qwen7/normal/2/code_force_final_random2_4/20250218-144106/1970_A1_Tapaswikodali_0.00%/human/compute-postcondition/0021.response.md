Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(", and ")", `balance` is either 1 or -1, `details` is a list containing two additional tuples (0, -(i+1), char_next) and (balance, -i, char), where char_next is the next character in the string `s`, and `i` is the index of the next character in the string `s`.**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(balance, -i, char)` to the `details` list. Here, `balance` remains the same as its previous value (either 1 or -1), `i` is the index of the next character in the string `s`, and `char` is the next character in the string `s`. The `details` list now contains one additional tuple compared to the initial state.
