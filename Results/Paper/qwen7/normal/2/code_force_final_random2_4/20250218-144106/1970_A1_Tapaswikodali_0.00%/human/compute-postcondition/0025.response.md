Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(", and ")", `balance` is either 1 or -1, `details` is a list containing tuples for each character in the string `s`, and `result` is the string formed by joining the third element of each tuple in `details` based on the sorted order of the first element (balance) and second element (-i).**

Explanation: The code snippet `result = ''.join(char for _, _, char in details)` does not change the values of `s`, `balance`, or `details`. Instead, it creates a new string `result` by joining the third element (character) from each tuple in the sorted `details` list. The sorting criteria remain the same: first by the balance value, and then by the negative index `-i` of the current character in the string `s`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated `result` variable, while the other variables retain their initial states.
