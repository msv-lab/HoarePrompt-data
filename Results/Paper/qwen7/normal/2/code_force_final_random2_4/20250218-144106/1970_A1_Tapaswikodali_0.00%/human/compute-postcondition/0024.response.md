Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(", and ")", `balance` is either 1 or -1, `details` is a list containing tuples for each character in the string `s`. Each tuple in `details` has three elements: the current value of `balance`, the negative index `-i` of the current character in the string `s`, and the character itself. The length of `details` is equal to the length of the string `s`. After sorting `details`, the list is sorted based on the balance value, and within the same balance value, it is sorted by the negative index `-i` of the current character.**

Explanation: The `details.sort()` line sorts the `details` list. Since `details` contains tuples with the first element being the balance, the second element being the negative index, and the third element being the character, the sorting will be done primarily by the balance value and secondarily by the negative index. The original values of `s`, `balance`, and `details` remain unchanged, but now `details` is sorted according to the specified criteria.
