### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to implement the "balanced shuffle" operation on a balanced parentheses sequence. The balanced shuffle involves computing the balance of each prefix, sorting based on these balances, and then reconstructing the sequence from the sorted data.

2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input string `s` using `input()`.

3. **Balance Calculation and Details Collection**:
   - The program iterates through each character in the string.
   - It calculates the balance of the prefix ending at each character.
   - It stores the balance, the negative of the index (to handle sorting in descending order), and the character itself in a list `details`.

4. **Sorting**:
   - The `details` list is sorted based on the balance values. If there's a tie, it uses the negative index to ensure the higher original positions come first.
   - Sorting with the balance in ascending order and the index in descending order ensures that the resulting sequence will have the required properties.

5. **Reconstructing the Result**:
   - After sorting, the program constructs the final result by extracting the characters from the sorted `details` list.
   - It uses a generator expression within `join` to create the final string.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the reconstructed string, which should be the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

### Verification:

Let's verify the correctness of the program step-by-step:

- **Balance Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the balance of each prefix.
- **Details Collection**: The `details` list is constructed with the correct balance, negative index, and character.
- **Sorting**: The sorting logic is correct. It sorts by balance in ascending order and by negative index in descending order, ensuring the required properties.
- **Reconstruction**: The reconstruction step correctly uses the sorted `details` list to construct the final string.

### Example Walkthrough:

Consider the input `(()(()))`:

1. **Balance Calculation**:
   - Prefix balance: 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1
   - Negative index: -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8
   - Characters: (, (, ), (, (, ), )

2. **Details List**:
   - `details = [(0, -1, '('), (1, -2, '('), (0, -3, ')'), (1, -4, '('), (0, -5, '('), (1, -6, ')'), (0, -7, ')'), (1, -8, ')')]`

3. **Sorting**:
   - Sorted `details`:
     - Balance: 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1
     - Negative Index: -1, -3, -5, -7, -2, -4, -6, -8
     - Characters: (, ), (, ), (, (, ), )

4. **Reconstruction**:
   - Constructed string: `()(()())`
