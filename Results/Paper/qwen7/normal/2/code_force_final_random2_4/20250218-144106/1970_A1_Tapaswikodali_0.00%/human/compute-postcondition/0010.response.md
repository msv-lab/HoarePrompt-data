Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(", and ")", `balance` is either 1 or -1, `details` is a list containing one tuple (balance, -i, char), and `i` is the index of the current character `char` in the string `s`.**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(balance, -i, char)` to the list `details`. Here, `balance` is either 1 or -1, `i` is the index of the current character `char` in the string `s`, and `char` is either "(" or ")". The initial state of `details` is an empty list, so after appending the tuple, `details` contains one tuple with the current values of `balance`, `-i`, and `char`.
