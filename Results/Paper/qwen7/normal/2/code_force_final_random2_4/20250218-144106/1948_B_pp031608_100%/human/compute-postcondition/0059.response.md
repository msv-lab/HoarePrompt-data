Output State: **`i` is between 1 and `m-2`, `m` must be greater than 1, `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to the first element of `nums`, `arr[i]` is the second element of `nums`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, `ans` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
