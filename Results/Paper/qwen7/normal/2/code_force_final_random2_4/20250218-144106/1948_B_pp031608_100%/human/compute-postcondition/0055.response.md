Postcondition: `i` is between 1 and `m-1`, `m` must be greater than 1, `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`, and `arr[i]` is either unchanged or adjusted such that if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, the elements of `nums` (which contains the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`) are checked for sorting. If they are not sorted, `ans` is set to `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If they are sorted, the conditions remain the same as the precondition.
