Output State: **`ans` is True, `m` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `n` is decremented by 1, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input().**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is directly assigned the value `True`, while the other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `m` remains an input integer, `i` stays at 0, `n` is still decremented by 1, and `arr` remains a list of integers obtained from input().
