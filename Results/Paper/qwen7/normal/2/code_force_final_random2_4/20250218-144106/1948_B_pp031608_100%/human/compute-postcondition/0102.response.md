Output State: **`arr` is an array of integers, `i` is an index within the array such that `i` is `i - 1`, `nums` is a list containing each digit of the integer at index `i-1` followed by the integer at index `i`, and `arr[i-1]` is equal to `nums[0]`, and `arr[i]` is the last element in `nums`.**

Explanation: The code converts the integer at index `i-1` in `arr` to a list of its digits and appends the integer at index `i` in `arr` to `nums`. Since `arr[i-1]` was already equal to `nums[0]`, this condition remains true. The new value of `nums` now includes all the digits of `arr[i-1]` followed by `arr[i]`.
