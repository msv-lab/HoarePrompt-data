Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `arr[i - 1]` is equal to `nums[0]` if no swap was made during the last iteration, and `arr[i]` is unchanged or adjusted according to the loop conditions, `ans` is `False` if any swap was made during the iterations that caused `nums` to be unsorted, otherwise, it remains `True` if no such condition was met.**

The code `m = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `m`. All other variables remain in their previous states.
