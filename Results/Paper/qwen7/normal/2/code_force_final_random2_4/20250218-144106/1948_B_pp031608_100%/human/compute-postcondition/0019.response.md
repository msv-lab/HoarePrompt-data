Output State: **`ans` is False, `m` is a positive integer, `i` is at least 1, the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to the first digit of `arr[i-1]`, `nums` is a list containing the first digit of `arr[i-1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `nums` that starts with the first digit of `arr[i-1]` (which is equal to `arr[i]` according to the precondition) and appends `arr[i]` to it. Since the value of `arr[i]` is already specified to be equal to the first digit of `arr[i-1]`, the list `nums` will contain these two identical values. The variables `ans`, `m`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
