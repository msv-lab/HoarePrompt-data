Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    m = int(input())
    arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    ans = True
    for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
        if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
            nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
            if nums != sorted(nums):
                ans = False
                break
            arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
    print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `ans` is False, `m` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, and the final value of `arr[0]` is the first digit of the original `arr[0]` if no further conditions in the loop were met to change it.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `ans` will remain `False` because the loop breaks when the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is true and the list `nums` is not sorted. The loop iterates backward from `m-1` to `1`, and if it finds any pair where the current element is less than the previous one and the constructed list `nums` is not sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop. Since the loop breaks as soon as it finds such a pair, `i` will be set to the index just before the found pair, which means `i` will be `0` after the loop ends. The value of `arr[0]` will be the first digit of the original `arr[0]` unless another condition in the loop changes it, but since we know `ans` is `False`, no further changes were made to `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be 0, `m` will be less than or equal to 1, `arr[i - 1]` will be equal to `nums[0]` if no swap was made during the last iteration, and `arr[i]` will be unchanged or adjusted according to the loop conditions. `ans` will be `False` if any swap was made during the iterations that caused `nums` to be unsorted, otherwise, `ans` will remain `True` if no such condition was met.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: The array `arr` has been modified such that for every pair of consecutive elements where the current element (`arr[i]`) is less than the previous element (`arr[i-1]`), the previous element (`arr[i-1]`) has been replaced with the smallest possible value formed by the digits of both elements concatenated together. This process continues until no further replacements can be made or the entire array is checked. The variable `i` will eventually reach 0, meaning the loop has completed its iterations. The variable `m` will also be 0 since it is decremented in the loop header. The variable `nums` will not be relevant as it is only used within the loop. The variable `ans` will be `False` if any replacement was made during the loop's execution, indicating that the array was not in a state where no two consecutive elements were in the correct order after all possible replacements. If no replacements were made, `ans` will remain `True`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the array `arr` will be transformed into a non-decreasing sequence where no two consecutive elements violate the order based on the described condition. The variable `i` will be 0, `m` will be 0, `nums` will not be relevant, and `ans` will indicate whether any changes were made during the process.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
