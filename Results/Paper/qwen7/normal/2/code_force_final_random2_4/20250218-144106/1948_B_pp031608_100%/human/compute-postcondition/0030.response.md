Output State: **`ans` is False, `m` is a positive integer, `i` is at least 1, the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to the first digit of `arr[i-1]`, `nums` is a list containing the first digit of `arr[i-1]` and the current value of `arr[i]` converted to integers, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
