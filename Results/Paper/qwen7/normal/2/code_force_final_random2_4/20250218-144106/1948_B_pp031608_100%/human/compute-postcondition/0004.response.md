Output State: **`ans` is True, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string.**

Explanation: The line `ans = True` sets the variable `ans` to `True`. The values of `m` and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial state as they are not affected by this line of code.
