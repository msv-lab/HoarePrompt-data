Postcondition: `arr` is an array of integers, `i` is an index within the array such that `i` is `i - 1`, `nums` is a list containing each digit of the integer at index `i-1` followed by the integer at index `i`, and `arr[i-1]` is equal to `nums[0]`. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i-1]`, then `arr[i-1]` is updated to `nums[0]` and the postcondition remains unchanged from the precondition.
