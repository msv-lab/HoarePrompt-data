Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be sorted using the specified operations. Specifically, the program checks if the current element is less than the previous element and attempts to split the larger element to see if sorting is possible. However, it does not properly handle the case where the array can still be sorted after splitting elements.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
12 3 45 67
```
The program should correctly identify that by splitting `45` into `[4, 5]`, the array can be sorted to `[12, 3, 4, 5, 67]`. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle this scenario. It only checks if the split array is sorted but does not update the original array correctly.

A more appropriate approach would involve attempting to split elements and checking if the resulting array is sorted. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        
        def can_sort(arr):
            for i in range(1, len(arr)):
                if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                    return False
            return True
        
        def split_and_check(arr):
            for i in range(len(arr)):
                num = arr[i]
                if num >= 10:
                    split_arr = [int(digit) for digit in str(num)]
                    if can_sort(split_arr + arr[:i] + arr[i+1:]):
                        arr[i] = split_arr[0]
                        return True
            return False
        
        while not can_sort(arr):
            if not split_and_check(arr):
                ans = False
                break
        
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the array is checked and split correctly to determine if it can be sorted.
