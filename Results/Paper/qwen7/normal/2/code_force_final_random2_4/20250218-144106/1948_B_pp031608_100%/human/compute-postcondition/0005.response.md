Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i`, `m`, and the range function itself.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for values of `i` starting from `m-1` down to 1 (inclusive). The loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.

3. **Determine necessary adjustments**:
   - **Variable `i`**: The loop starts with `i = m-1` and decrements by 1 each iteration until `i` reaches 0. Therefore, `i` must be at least 0 for the loop to execute.
   - **Variable `m`**: `m` is used to determine the starting value of `i`. It should be a positive integer to ensure that `i` can start from `m-1` and decrement properly.
   - **List `arr`**: Although `arr` is not directly used in the loop head, its presence and structure might affect the loop body. However, since the loop body is omitted, we don't need to adjust `arr` specifically for the loop to execute.

4. **Formulate the final state**:
   - `ans` is `True`, but this does not affect the loop execution, so it remains unchanged.
   - `m` must be a positive integer to ensure that `i` can start from `m-1` and decrement properly.
   - `i` must be at least 0 to ensure the loop can start and continue executing.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`ans` is True, `m` must be a positive integer, `i` must be at least 0**
