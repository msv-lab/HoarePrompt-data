Postcondition: `i` is between 1 and `m-1`, `m` must be greater than 1, the current value of `arr[i]` is less than the previous value `arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, and if the elements of `nums` are not sorted, `ans` is set to `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If the elements of `nums` are sorted, `ans` remains unchanged.
