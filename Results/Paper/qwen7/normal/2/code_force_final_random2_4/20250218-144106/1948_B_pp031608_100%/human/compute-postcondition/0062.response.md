Output State: **`i` is between 1 and `m-2`, `m` must be greater than 1, `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`, `arr[i]` is the second element of `nums`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, and `ans` is `False`**.

Explanation: The code `arr[i - 1] = nums[0]` updates the value of `arr[i - 1]` to be the first element of `nums`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged. Therefore, `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`, while `arr[i]` is still the second element of `nums`, and `nums` remains a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`. The value of `ans` remains `False` as no condition changes its state.
