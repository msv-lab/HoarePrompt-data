Output State: **`ans` is False, `m` must be a positive integer, `i` must be at least 0, the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to the last digit of `arr[i-1]`, and the list `nums` contains the digits of `arr[i-1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**

The code `ans = False` changes the value of `ans` from `True` to `False`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
