Output State: **`arr` is an array of integers, `i` is an index within the array such that the element at index `i-1` is less than the element at index `i`, `nums` is a list containing each digit of the integer at index `i-1` followed by the integer at index `i`, `ans` is `False`**.

Explanation: The line `ans = False` simply assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `ans`. This does not affect the values of `arr`, `i`, or `nums`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions with `ans` set to `False`.
