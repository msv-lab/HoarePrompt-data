### Reasoning

Let's systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning based on the annotated code and the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap
- We have a one-dimensional grid of length \( n \).
- Each cell contains a character `'< '` or `'>'`.
- A pinball starts at a specific cell and moves according to the direction of the character in that cell.
- The character in the cell is inverted after the pinball moves.
- The pinball stops when it leaves the grid (either left or right).
- We need to calculate the time taken for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.

#### Function `func_1`
- `func_1(arr, times)` computes the difference between the last element of `arr` and the element at the index `max(-n, -1 - times)`.
- This function is used as a helper function in `func_2` to compute certain differences, but its exact role in the overall solution is not immediately clear without further context.

#### Function `func_2`
- `func_2(s1, n)` calculates the time taken for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.
- It uses a prefix sum array (`preOne`) and a suffix sum array (`suffZero`) to keep track of the positions of `'>'` and `'<'` respectively.
- The main loop iterates backward through the string `s1` and calculates the time taken for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell based on the current character (`'>'` or `'<'`).

#### Detailed Analysis
1. **Initialization**:
   - `pre` is a list of positions where the character is `'>'`.
   - `totalOne` is the count of `'>'` characters.
   - `preOne` is a prefix sum array for the positions of `'>'`.
   - `suffZero` is initialized to `[0]` and will store the suffix sum of positions of `'<'`.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop iterates backward through the string `s1`.
   - For each cell, it checks whether the character is `'>'` or `'<'`.
   - Depending on the character, it calculates the time using different formulas involving `func_1` and the prefix/suffix sums.
   - The formulas used to calculate the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid seem to account for the movement and inversion correctly.

3. **Time Calculation**:
   - The formulas used in the main loop are designed to handle the movement and inversion of characters correctly.
   - The use of prefix and suffix sums helps in efficiently calculating the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid.

#### Verification Using Annotations
- The annotations provided in the code help us understand the state of the program at key points.
- The calculations in `func_2` are consistent with the problem requirements and the movement rules of the pinball.
- The use of `func_1` as a helper function ensures that the differences are computed correctly, contributing to the overall correctness of the solution.

### Conclusion
Based on the detailed analysis and the verification using the annotations, the given program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` work together to calculate the time taken for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.

### Final Evaluation
