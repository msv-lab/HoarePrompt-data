Output State: **`el` is equal to `s1[2]` or `s1[3]`, `totalOne` is unchanged, `suffZero` and `preOne` are unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `zeroInd` is 2 times the result of `func_1(suffZero, ol)`, `oneInd` is unchanged, `fi` and `n` remain unchanged, `i` is either 2 or 3 depending on the condition, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`.**

In this scenario, the variable `zeroInd` is updated to be twice the result of the function call `func_1(suffZero, ol)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
