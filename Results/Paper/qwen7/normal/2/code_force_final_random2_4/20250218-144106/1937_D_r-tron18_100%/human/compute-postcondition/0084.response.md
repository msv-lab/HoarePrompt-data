Output State: **`el` is equal to `s1[2]` or `s1[3]`, `totalOne` is `totalOne - 1`, `suffZero` and `preOne` are unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `fi` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `i` is either 2 or 3 depending on the condition, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is shortened by one element, and `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi` if `ol > zr`, otherwise `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`.**

Explanation: The code `totalOne -= 1` decreases the value of `totalOne` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. The value of `i` is either 2 or 3 depending on the condition, and the expression for `ans[i]` is updated based on the new value of `totalOne`.
