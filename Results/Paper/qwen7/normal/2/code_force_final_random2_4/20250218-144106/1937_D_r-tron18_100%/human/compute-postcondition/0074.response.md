Output State: **`el` is equal to `s1[2]` or `s1[3]`, `totalOne` is unchanged, `suffZero` and `preOne` are unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `zeroInd` is 2 times the result of `func_1(suffZero, ol)`, `oneInd` is 2 * `preOne[-1]` - `func_1(preOne, 1)`, `fi` and `n` remain unchanged, `i` is either 2 or 3 depending on the condition, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `oneInd` to `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)`. Since `preOne` is unchanged, `preOne[-1]` remains the last element of `preOne`. The function `func_1` is called with `preOne` and `1` as arguments, but its result is not specified, so it is kept as `func_1(preOne, 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
