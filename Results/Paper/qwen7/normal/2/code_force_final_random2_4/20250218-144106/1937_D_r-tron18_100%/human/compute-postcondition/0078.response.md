Output State: **`el` is equal to `s1[2]` or `s1[3]`, `totalOne` is unchanged, `suffZero` and `preOne` are unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `zeroInd` is equal to `2 * (len(suffZero) - 1)`, `oneInd` is equal to `oneInd - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `fi` and `n` remain unchanged, `i` is either 2 or 3 depending on the condition, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`.**

Explanation: The code subtracts the value of `func_1(preOne, 1)` from `oneInd`. Since `oneInd` was previously defined as `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`, after the subtraction, `oneInd` becomes `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
