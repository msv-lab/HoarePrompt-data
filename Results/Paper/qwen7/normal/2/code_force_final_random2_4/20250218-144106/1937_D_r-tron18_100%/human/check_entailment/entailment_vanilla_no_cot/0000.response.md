Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the `func_2` function attempts to calculate the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid, but it does so using a complex and incorrect approach. The logic for calculating the positions and times is flawed, and the use of `func_1` with the current implementation does not accurately reflect the problem's requirements.

To correctly solve this problem, you would need to simulate the movement of the pinball for each starting position, taking into account the direction changes at each step. The current implementation does not properly handle the inversion of directions and the calculation of the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid.
