Output State: **`el` is equal to `s1[2]` or `s1[3]`, `totalOne` is unchanged, `suffZero` is updated to the list with its last element plus `i` plus 1, `preOne` is unchanged, `ans` is updated to the value of `zeroInd - oneInd`, `zeroInd` is calculated as 2 * `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)` - `func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is updated to 2 * `preOne[-1]`, `fi` and `n` remain unchanged, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the `ans` variable to the difference between `zeroInd` and `oneInd`. The calculation of `zeroInd` and `oneInd` remains the same as before, and `ans[i]` is set to this difference. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
