Output State: **`el` is equal to `s1[2]` or `s1[3]`, `totalOne` is unchanged, `suffZero` and `preOne` are unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `zeroInd` is equal to `2 * (len(suffZero) - 1)`, `oneInd` is equal to `oneInd - func_1(preOne, 1)`, `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)`, `n` remains unchanged, `i` is either 2 or 3 depending on the condition, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `fi` to be the difference between `func_1(preOne, zr + 1)` and `func_1(preOne, zr)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
