Output State: **`el` is equal to `s1[1]`, `totalOne` is unchanged, `suffZero` is now `[suffZero[-1] + 3]`, `preOne` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `zeroInd` is now `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`, `oneInd` is now 2 * `func_1(preOne, zr)`, `fi` is unchanged, `i` is 3, `n` is unchanged, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`**.

This means that the value of `oneInd` is updated to be twice the result of `func_1(preOne, zr)`. All other variables retain their previous values from the initial state.
