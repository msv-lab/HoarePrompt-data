Output State: **`el` is equal to `s1[i]`, and `el` is not equal to '>'; `suffZero` is a list with its last element updated to the value of `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`; `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`; `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, len(suffZero) - 1)`**.

In this output state, the variable `oneInd` is calculated as twice the result of `func_1(preOne, zr)`, where `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`. All other variables retain their previous values as per the initial state.
