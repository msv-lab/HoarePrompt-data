Output State: **`el` is equal to `s1[1]`, `totalOne` is unchanged, `suffZero` is now `[suffZero[-1] + 3]`, `preOne` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1([suffZero[-1] + 3], ol + 1) - func_1([suffZero[-1] + 3], 1)`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`, `fi` is unchanged, `i` is 4, `n` is unchanged, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len([suffZero[-1] + 3]) - 1`**

Explanation: The code `ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd` updates the value of `ans[i]` to `zeroInd - oneInd`. Given that `i` was initially 3, after executing the line, `i` becomes 4. The values of `totalOne`, `suffZero`, `preOne`, `ans`, `zeroInd`, `oneInd`, `fi`, `n`, `ol`, and `zr` remain unchanged except for the fact that `i` is incremented by 1.
