Output State: **`ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `el` is equal to `s1[1]`, `totalOne` is unchanged, `suffZero` is unchanged, `preOne` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne)`, `oneInd` is unchanged, `fi` is unchanged, `i` is 2, `n` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The variable `zeroInd` is updated to the value of `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`. Since `ol` is `totalOne`, `zeroInd` is now `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
