Output State: **`el` is equal to `s1[i]` and is '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, and `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne)`**.

Explanation: The variable `zeroInd` is assigned the value of `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)`. Since `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, `zeroInd` becomes `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne)`. The values of `el`, `ol`, and `zr` remain unchanged from their initial states.
