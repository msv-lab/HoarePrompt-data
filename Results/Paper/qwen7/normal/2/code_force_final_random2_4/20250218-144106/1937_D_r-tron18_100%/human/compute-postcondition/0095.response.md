Postcondition: **`el` is equal to `s1[2]` or `s1[3]`, `totalOne` remains unchanged, `suffZero` and `preOne` remain unchanged unless updated according to the condition, `ans` is updated based on the condition, `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are recalculated accordingly, `fi` and `n` remain unchanged, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, and `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`.**

This postcondition summarizes the possible outcomes of the if-else block. Depending on whether `el` equals `'> '` or not, different updates are applied to `suffZero`, `ans`, `zeroInd`, and `oneInd`.
