Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `t` is the number of test cases such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `pre` is a list of integers where each element is (i + 1) for every index i where `s1[i]` == '>', `totalOne` is the length of the list `pre`, `preOne` is a list obtained by taking the prefix sum of the list `pre` with an initial value of 0, `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    el = s1[i]
    if el == '>':
        ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
        if ol <= zr:
            zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol)
            oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
        else:
            zeroInd = 2 * suffZero[-1]
            oneInd = func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)
            oneInd -= func_1(preOne, 1)
            fi = func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi
        preOne.pop()
        totalOne -= 1
    else:
        suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)
        ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
        if zr <= ol:
            zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]
            oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1
        else:
            zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
            oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1]
            ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `el` is equal to `s1[i]`. If `el` is '>', then `ol` is `totalOne - 1`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `preOne` is shortened by removing the last element, `ans[i]` is calculated as follows: if `ol <= zr`, then `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`; otherwise, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`. If `el` is not '>', then `suffZero` is a list with its last element updated to the value of `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`; `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`; if `zr` is less than or equal to `ol`, then `zeroInd` is `suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]`, `oneInd` is `2 * func_1(preOne, len(suffZero) - 1)`, and `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1`. Otherwise, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`, `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, and `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`, and `zr` is greater than `ol`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `el` is equal to `s1[1]`, `totalOne` is unchanged, `suffZero` and `preOne` are unchanged except when certain conditions are met, `ans` is unchanged, `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are recalculated based on different conditions, `fi` and `n` remain unchanged, and `i` is either 3 or 4 depending on the condition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `el` is equal to `s1[2]` or `s1[3]`, `totalOne` remains unchanged, `suffZero` and `preOne` remain unchanged unless updated according to the condition, `ans` is updated based on the condition, `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are recalculated accordingly, `fi` and `n` remain unchanged, `ol` is equal to `totalOne`, and `zr` is equal to `len(suffZero) - 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
