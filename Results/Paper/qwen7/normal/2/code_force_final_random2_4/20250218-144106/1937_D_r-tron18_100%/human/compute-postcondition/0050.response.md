Output State: **`ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `el` is equal to `s1[1]`, `totalOne` is unchanged, `suffZero` is unchanged, `preOne` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `zeroInd` is 2 times the last element of `suffZero`, `oneInd` is `func_1(preOne, zr) + func_1(preOne, zr + 1)`, `fi` is unchanged, `i` is 2, `n` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `oneInd` by calling the function `func_1` twice with different arguments and summing the results. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, `oneInd` is expressed as the sum of two calls to `func_1` with the specified arguments. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
