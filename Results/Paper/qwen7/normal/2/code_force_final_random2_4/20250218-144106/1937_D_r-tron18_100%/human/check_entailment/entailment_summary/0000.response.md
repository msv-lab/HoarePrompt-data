Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify that the logic implemented in `func_2` correctly calculates the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

1. **Understanding the Logic**:
   - The function `func_2` processes the string `s1` and calculates the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.
   - It uses prefix sums (`preOne`) and suffix sums (`suffZero`) to efficiently compute the required values.
   - The logic involves calculating the balance of '<' and '>' characters and using these balances to determine the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid.

2. **Key Components**:
   - `pre` is a list of indices where the character is '>'.
   - `totalOne` keeps track of the total number of '>' characters.
   - `preOne` is a cumulative sum of the indices in `pre`.
   - `suffZero` is a list of suffix sums of positions where the character is '<'.

3. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - The function iterates through the string `s1` in reverse order.
   - For each character, it calculates the difference between the count of zeros and ones based on the balance of '<' and '>' characters.
   - The calculations involve using the prefix and suffix sums to find the positions where the pinball would move left or right and the time taken to reach the boundary.

4. **Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly handles the movement of the pinball and the inversion of characters.
   - The use of prefix and suffix sums ensures efficient computation of the required values.
   - The final output matches the expected results as seen in the example provided.

Given the detailed analysis and the correctness of the logic implemented in `func_2`, the program meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
