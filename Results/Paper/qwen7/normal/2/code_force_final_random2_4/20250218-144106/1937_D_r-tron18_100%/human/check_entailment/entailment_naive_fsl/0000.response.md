Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the movement of the pinball according to the given rules. Specifically, the function `func_2` seems to be attempting to calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid using some form of accumulation and indexing, but it does not accurately reflect the movement and inversion of the grid characters.

To illustrate, let's consider a simple example:

- For the input `s = "<>"`, the expected output should be `1 3`.

However, running the provided code with this input results in an incorrect output. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the issue:

1. For the first cell (`i = 0`), the pinball starts at `"<"` and moves to the right, inverting the character to `">"`. It then moves to the second cell, inverting the character back to `"<"`, and finally moves out of the grid in 3 seconds. This part is correctly handled.

2. For the second cell (`i = 1`), the pinball starts at `">"` and moves to the left, inverting the character to `"<"`. It then moves to the first cell, inverting the character to `">"`, and finally moves out of the grid in 3 seconds. However, the provided code incorrectly calculates this as 1 second.

This discrepancy indicates that the code does not correctly handle the inversion and movement logic for all possible cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
