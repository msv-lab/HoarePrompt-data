Output State: **`el` is equal to `s1[i]`, and `el` is not equal to '>'; `suffZero` is a list with its last element updated to the value of `suffZero[-1] + i + 1`; `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1]`, and `zeroInd` is calculated as `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`; `zr` is greater than `ol`.**

Explanation: The code updates `oneInd` to `2 * preOne[-1]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `oneInd` and retains the other variables in their initial states.
