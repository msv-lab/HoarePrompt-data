Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires simulating the movement of a pinball on a grid where each cell contains a character that determines the direction of movement. The direction changes after each move until the pinball leaves the grid.

2. **Key Components**:
   - The grid is represented by a string `s1` of length `n`.
   - For each position `i` in the grid, we need to calculate how long it takes for a pinball placed there to leave the grid.
   - The solution uses prefix sums and suffix sums to efficiently compute the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function calculates the difference between the last element of a list and an element at a specific index. This is used to compute positions based on the accumulated values.
   - **func_2**: This function computes the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid for each position. It uses prefix and suffix sums to handle the direction changes and calculate the time taken.

4. **Logic Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly handles both cases where the current cell is '>' or '<'.
   - The use of prefix and suffix sums allows efficient computation of the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - The final results are printed correctly.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases where the pinball might start at the boundaries or where the grid configuration might cause the pinball to oscillate before leaving the grid.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
