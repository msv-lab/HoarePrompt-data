Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We have a one-dimensional grid of length `n`.
   - Each cell contains a character `'< '` or `'>'`.
   - A pinball starts at a specific cell and moves according to the direction of the character in that cell.
   - The character in the cell is inverted after the pinball moves.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid (either left or right).
   - We need to calculate the time taken for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.

2. **Given Functions**:
   - `func_1(arr, times)`: This function seems to be calculating some difference between elements in `arr` but with a specific offset.
   - `func_2(s1, n)`: This function calculates the time taken for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is used to calculate differences between elements in an array. However, the logic inside this function does not seem directly related to solving the problem. It might be a helper function for `func_2`.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - `pre = [i + 1 for (i, el) in enumerate(s1) if el == '>']`: This creates a list of positions where the character is `'>'`.
   - `totalOne = len(pre)`: This counts the number of `'>'` characters.
   - `preOne = list(accumulate(pre, initial=0))`: This creates a prefix sum array for the positions of `'>'`.
   - `suffZero = [0]`: This initializes a suffix sum array for the positions of `'<'`.
   - The main loop iterates backward through the string `s1` and calculates the time taken for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.
     - For each cell, it checks whether the character is `'>'` or `'<'`.
     - Depending on the character, it calculates the time using different formulas involving `func_1` and the prefix/suffix sums.

5. **Calculation Logic**:
   - The logic inside `func_2` appears to correctly handle the movement of the pinball and the inversion of characters.
   - The formulas used to calculate the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid seem to account for the movement and inversion correctly.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the given program seems to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` appear to work together to calculate the time taken for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
