Output State: **`el` is equal to `s1[1]`, `totalOne` is unchanged, `suffZero` is now `[suffZero[-1] + 3]`, `preOne` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`, `oneInd` is unchanged, `fi` is unchanged, `i` is 3, `n` is unchanged, `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `zeroInd` by calling the function `func_1` twice with different arguments and performing arithmetic operations. However, the actual value of `func_1(suffZero, ol + 1)` and `func_1(suffZero, 1)` is not specified, so `zeroInd` is updated to the expression `2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
