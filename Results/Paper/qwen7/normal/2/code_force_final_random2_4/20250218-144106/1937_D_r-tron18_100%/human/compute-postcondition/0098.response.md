Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `s1`, which is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'; and `n`, which is a positive integer representing the length of the string `s1`. The function returns a specific value based on the balance of '<' and '>' characters in the string `s1`.**

This means the function `func_2` takes a string `s1` and its length `n` as inputs. It checks the balance of '<' and '>' characters in the string and returns a value based on this balance.
