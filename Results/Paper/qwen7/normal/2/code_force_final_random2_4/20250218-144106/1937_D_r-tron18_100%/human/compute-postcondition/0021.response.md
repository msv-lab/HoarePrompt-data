Postcondition: `el` is '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `ans[i]` is either `zeroInd - oneInd` when `ol <= zr` holds, or `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi` when `ol > zr`. Here, `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are calculated differently based on the condition: `zeroInd` is `2 * suffZero[-1]` and `fi` is `func_1(preOne, zr + 1) - func_1(preOne, zr)` in the `else` case, while `zeroInd` is `2 * func_1(suffZero, totalOne)` and `oneInd` is `2 * preOne[-1] - func_1(preOne, 1)` in the `if` case.
