Postcondition: `el` is '>', `ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `ans[i]` is calculated as follows: if `ol <= zr`, then `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd`; otherwise, `ans[i]` is `zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1 - fi`. Here, `zeroInd` and `oneInd` are determined differently in each case, but they always represent specific calculations involving `suffZero`, `preOne`, and other relevant variables.
