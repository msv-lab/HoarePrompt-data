Output State: **`ol` is `totalOne`, `zr` is `len(suffZero) - 1`, `el` is equal to `s1[1]`, `totalOne` is unchanged, `suffZero` is unchanged, `preOne` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `zeroInd` is 2 times the last element of `suffZero`, `oneInd` is unchanged, `fi` is unchanged, `i` is 2, `n` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The variable `zeroInd` is assigned the value `2 * suffZero[-1]`. This means `zeroInd` now holds twice the value of the last element in the list `suffZero`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
