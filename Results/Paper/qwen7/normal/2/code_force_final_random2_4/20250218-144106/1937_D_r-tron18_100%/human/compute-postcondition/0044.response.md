Output State: **`el` is equal to `s1[1]`, `totalOne` is unchanged, `suffZero` is unchanged, `preOne` is unchanged, `ans` is unchanged, `zeroInd` is unchanged, `oneInd` is unchanged, `fi` is unchanged, `i` is 2, `n` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `el = s1[i]` assigns the value of `s1[1]` (since `i` is 1) to `el`. All other variables remain unchanged. Since `i` was initially 1, after executing the line `i` is incremented by 1, making it 2.
