Output State: The `arr` list is now empty, and `freq` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each stick length that was originally in the `arr` list.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, every stick length in the original `arr` list has been processed exactly once. Therefore, the `arr` list becomes empty since all elements have been removed. The `freq` dictionary contains each unique stick length from the original list as keys, with their respective frequencies as values, which were incremented during each iteration of the loop.
