Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer represents the length of a stick, and the length of the list is the number of sticks available (1 <= n <= 100). Each stick length is a positive integer not exceeding 100; `freq` is an empty dictionary.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty dictionary named `freq`. The list `arr` remains unchanged with its original state, which is a list of integers representing the lengths of sticks. The only new variable introduced is `freq`, which is an empty dictionary.
