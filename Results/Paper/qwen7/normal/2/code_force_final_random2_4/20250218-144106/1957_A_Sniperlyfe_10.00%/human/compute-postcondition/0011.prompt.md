You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer represents the length of a stick, and the length of the list is the number of sticks available (1 <= n <= 100). Each stick length is a positive integer not exceeding 100.
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: Output State: The `arr` list is now empty, and `freq` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each stick length that was originally in the `arr` list.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, every stick length in the original `arr` list has been processed exactly once. Therefore, the `arr` list becomes empty since all elements have been removed. The `freq` dictionary contains each unique stick length from the original list as keys, with their respective frequencies as values, which were incremented during each iteration of the loop.
    return sum(v // 4 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of each frequency by 4, where the frequencies are the values in the `freq` dictionary.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers representing the lengths of sticks. It returns the sum of the integer division of each frequency by 4, where the frequencies are the values in the `freq` dictionary.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the sum of the integer division of each frequency by 4, where the frequencies are the values in the `freq` dictionary.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
