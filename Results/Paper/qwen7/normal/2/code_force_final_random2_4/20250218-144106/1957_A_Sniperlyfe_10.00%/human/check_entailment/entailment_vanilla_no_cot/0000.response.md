Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem but has an issue in the logic of the `func_1` function. The function calculates the number of complete regular polygons (squares and triangles, since a minimum of 3 sides is required to form a polygon) that can be formed by dividing the frequency of each stick length by the minimum number of sides required for a polygon (3 for a triangle and 4 for a square). However, it does not account for the fact that to form multiple polygons, the minimum number of sides required should be considered across all polygons, which is 3.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    return min((v // 3 for v in freq.values()))
```

This corrected function will correctly determine the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed by ensuring that at least 3 sticks are used per polygon.
