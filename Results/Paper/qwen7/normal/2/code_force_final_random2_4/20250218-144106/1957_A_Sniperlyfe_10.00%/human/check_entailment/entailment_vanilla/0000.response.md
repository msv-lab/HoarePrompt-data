Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to determine the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed using the given sticks, where each side of a polygon must be formed by exactly one stick and no stick can be reused.

2. **Key Points**:
   - A regular polygon with \( k \) sides requires \( k \) sticks.
   - To maximize the number of polygons, we need to find the smallest number of sticks among all stick lengths because the limiting factor will be the smallest number of sticks available for forming complete polygons.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks and their lengths.
   - It then calls `func_1` with the list of stick lengths.

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - `func_1` uses a dictionary to count the frequency of each stick length.
   - It then calculates the number of complete polygons that can be formed by dividing the frequency of each stick length by 4 (since a polygon has at least 3 sides, but the minimum we consider here is 4 for simplicity).
   - However, this approach does not correctly handle the limiting factor of the smallest number of sticks available for forming complete polygons.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - We should find the minimum value in the list of stick lengths.
   - The number of polygons that can be formed is the integer division of the total number of sticks by the minimum stick length.

6. **Corrected Code**:
   ```python
   def func_1(arr):
       min_length = min(arr)
       return len(arr) // min_length
   ```

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The given code does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum number of polygons. It incorrectly sums up the divisions by 4, which is not relevant to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
