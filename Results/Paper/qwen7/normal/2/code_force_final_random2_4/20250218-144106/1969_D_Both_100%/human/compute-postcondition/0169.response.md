Postcondition: `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple (except possibly the last one, which may have been removed), `k` must be greater than 0, and `heap` is a heap containing the last element of the `combined` list if the `combined` list was not empty.
