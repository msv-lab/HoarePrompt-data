Output State: **`max_profit` is either equal to `current_profit` or remains 0; `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - removed_item[0]`; `item` is the last item popped from `combined`; `k` is less than or equal to 0; `heap` is an updated heap with one item pushed and another popped; `removed_item` is the item that was heappushedpoped from the heap; `combined` is now one item shorter since the last item was popped.**

Explanation: The code subtracts `removed_item[0]` from `current_profit`. Since `removed_item` is the item that was heappushedpoped from the heap, the value of `removed_item[0]` is known but not specified. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
