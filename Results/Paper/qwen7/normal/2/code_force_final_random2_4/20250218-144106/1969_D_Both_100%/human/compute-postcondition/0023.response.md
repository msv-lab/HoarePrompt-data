Output State: `current_profit` remains 0, `test_cases` remains a positive integer, `heap` is a list containing all elements from `combined` after each has been popped once (i.e., `k` times), `remaining_items` remains an empty list, `neg_prices` remains a list of negative values from `prices`, `bonuses` remains a list returned by `func_2()`, `n` remains the return value of `func_2()`, `k` becomes 0, `max_profit` remains 0, and `combined` remains a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the `heap` will contain all elements that were originally in `combined`, with each element having been popped exactly once. The variable `k` will be reduced to 0 since the loop condition `k > 0` will no longer be satisfied. All other variables remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop.
