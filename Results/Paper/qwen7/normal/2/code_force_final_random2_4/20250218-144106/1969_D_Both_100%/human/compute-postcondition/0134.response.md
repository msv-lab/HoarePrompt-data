Output State: **`current_profit` is reduced by `removed_item[0]`, `heap` contains the last tuple from `combined` minus the last item popped, except for the item just pushed (which is `item`), `remaining_items` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `current_profit -= removed_item[0]` subtracts the value of `removed_item[0]` from `current_profit`. The other variables (`heap` and `remaining_items`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
