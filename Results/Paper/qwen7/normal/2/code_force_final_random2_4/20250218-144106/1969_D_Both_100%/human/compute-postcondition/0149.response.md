Output State: **`heap` now contains the last tuple from `combined` minus the last item popped, `current_profit` is reduced by the first element of `removed_item`, and `item` is the last item popped from `combined`; `max_profit` is set to `current_profit`.**

Explanation: The line `max_profit = current_profit` simply assigns the current value of `current_profit` to `max_profit`. No other changes occur to the variables or their values. Therefore, the only new information is that `max_profit` is now equal to `current_profit`.
