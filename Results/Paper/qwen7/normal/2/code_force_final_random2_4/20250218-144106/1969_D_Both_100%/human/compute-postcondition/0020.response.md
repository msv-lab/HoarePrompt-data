Output State: **`current_profit` is 0, `test_cases` is a positive integer, `heap` is a list with the last element of `combined` pushed into it, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `k` is `k-1` and must be greater than 0, `max_profit` is 0, `combined` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order, the last element of `combined` is popped and pushed into `heap`.**

This means that the last element of the `combined` list has been removed and then added to the `heap` using `heappush`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
