Postcondition: `max_profit` remains 0, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`, `combined` is now a list with one item less than before (since `item = combined.pop()`), `k` is less than or equal to 0, and `heap` is an empty heap. The sum of the first element and the second element of `item` is less than 0.
