Output State: **`max_profit` remains unchanged unless `current_profit` becomes greater than `max_profit`, in which case `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value of `current_profit` to `max_profit`. Since no new information about `current_profit` or `max_profit` is provided (i.e., whether `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`), `max_profit` remains unchanged unless it was already known that `current_profit` was greater than `max_profit` before this line of code. Therefore, the only information that changes is the condition for updating `max_profit`, but the actual value of `max_profit` itself does not change without additional context.
