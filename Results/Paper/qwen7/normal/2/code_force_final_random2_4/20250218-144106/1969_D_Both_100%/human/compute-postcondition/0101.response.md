Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `k` iterations in total. After these iterations, the `heap` will contain the last tuple from the `combined` list, as each iteration pops one tuple from `combined` and pushes it into `heap`. The `current_profit` and `max_profit` remain 0 because there are no operations within the loop that modify these variables. `remaining_items` remains an empty list, `neg_prices` is still a list of negative values from `prices`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, and `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`.

In summary, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is:
- `current_profit` remains 0
- `max_profit` remains 0
- `heap` contains the last tuple from `combined`
- `remaining_items` is an empty list
- `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`
- `n` is the return value of `func_2()`
- `k` is fully utilized (no remaining iterations)
- `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`
