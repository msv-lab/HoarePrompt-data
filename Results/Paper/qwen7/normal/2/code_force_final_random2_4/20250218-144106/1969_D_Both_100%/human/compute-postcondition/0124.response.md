Output State: **`current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is equal to `current_profit`, `heap` contains the last tuple from `combined` minus the last item popped, except for the item just pushed (which is `item`), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `neg_prices` is a list of negative values from `prices`, `n` is the return value of `func_2()`, `bonuses` is a list returned by `func_2()`, and `combined` is now two items shorter.**

Explanation: The line `max_profit = current_profit` updates the value of `max_profit` to be equal to the value of `current_profit`. All other variables remain unchanged as they were not affected by this line of code.
