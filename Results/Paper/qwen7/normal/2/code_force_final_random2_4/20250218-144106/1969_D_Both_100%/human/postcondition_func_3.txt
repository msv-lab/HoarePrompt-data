The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by parameters \( n \), \( k \), `prices`, and `bonuses`. For each test case, it calculates the maximum profit by combining elements from `prices` and `bonuses` under certain conditions. It uses a heap to manage these combinations efficiently and updates the maximum profit accordingly. After processing all test cases, it prints the highest profit achieved across all cases.
