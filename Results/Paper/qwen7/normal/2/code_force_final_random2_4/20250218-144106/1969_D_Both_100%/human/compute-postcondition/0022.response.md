Output State: `current_profit` remains 0, `test_cases` remains a positive integer, `heap` is a list containing all elements from `combined` after it has been fully processed, `remaining_items` remains an empty list, `neg_prices` remains a list of negative values from `prices`, `bonuses` remains a list returned by `func_2()`, `n` remains the return value of `func_2()`, `k` becomes 0 after all iterations, `max_profit` remains 0, and `combined` remains a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the `heap` will contain all the elements that were in the `combined` list, as each element was popped from `combined` and pushed into `heap`. The variable `k` will be reduced to 0 since the loop runs `k` times and `k` starts as a positive integer. All other variables remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
