Output State: **`item` is the second last element of `combined`, `combined` is modified (two elements less), `heap` is modified (pushed `removed_item` and popped the smallest element), `current_profit` is decreased by `item[1]`, and `max_profit` remains unchanged unless `current_profit` becomes greater than `max_profit`, in which case `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`, and `combined` must still contain at least two elements.**

Explanation: The code `current_profit -= item[1]` decreases `current_profit` by the value of `item[1]`. Since `item` was the last element of `combined`, after this operation, `item` becomes the second last element of `combined`. The precondition that `combined` must still contain at least one element is now that it must contain at least two elements. All other conditions remain unchanged.
