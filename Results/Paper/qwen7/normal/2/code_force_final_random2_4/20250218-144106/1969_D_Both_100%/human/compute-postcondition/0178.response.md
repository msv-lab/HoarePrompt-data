Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `max_profit` remains 0, `current_profit` remains 0, `combined` is an empty list, `k` is less than or equal to 0, and `heap` is an empty heap.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, `max_profit` and `current_profit` have not been updated since they are only modified within the loop when `current_profit` exceeds `max_profit`. The `combined` list is empty because all elements were popped from it during the iterations. Since the loop runs for `k` times and `k` is decremented with each iteration, `k` will be less than or equal to 0 after all iterations. Finally, the `heap` is empty as it only contains elements pushed from the `combined` list, and once `combined` is empty, no more elements can be pushed into the `heap`.
