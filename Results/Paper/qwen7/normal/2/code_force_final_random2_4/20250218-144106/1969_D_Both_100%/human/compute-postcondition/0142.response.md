Output State: **`current_profit` is reduced by `item[1]`, `heap` contains the last tuple from `combined` minus the last item popped, `item` is the last item popped from `combined`, and `remaining_items` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `current_profit -= item[1]` subtracts the value of `item[1]` from `current_profit`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `current_profit` is updated by reducing its value by `item[1]`, while `heap`, `item`, and `remaining_items` retain their original states.
