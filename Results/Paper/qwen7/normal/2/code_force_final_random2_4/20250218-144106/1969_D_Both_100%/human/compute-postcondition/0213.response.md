Output State: **`max_profit` is either equal to `current_profit` or remains 0; `current_profit` is updated to either `current_profit - item[1]` if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0` or `current_profit + item[0]` otherwise; `item` is the last item popped from `combined`; `k` is less than or equal to 0; `heap` is an updated heap with one item pushed and another popped; `removed_item` is the item that was heappushedpoped from the heap.**

This means that after executing the line `removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)`, the `removed_item` variable now holds the item that was removed from the heap after pushing the `item` into it. All other variables retain their previous conditions as described in the initial state, with `max_profit` and `current_profit` being updated according to the specified rules, and `heap` being modified by the operation.
