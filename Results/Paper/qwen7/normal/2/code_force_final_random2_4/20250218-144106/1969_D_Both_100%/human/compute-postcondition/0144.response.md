Postcondition: `current_profit` is reduced by either `item[1]` if `item[0] + item[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, or by `item[0]` if `item[0] + item[1]` is less than 0. `heap` contains the last tuple from `combined` minus the last item popped, `item` is the last item popped from `combined`, and `remaining_items` is an empty list.
