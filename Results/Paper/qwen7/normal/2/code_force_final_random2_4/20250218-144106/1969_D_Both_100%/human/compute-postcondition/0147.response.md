Output State: **`heap` now contains the last tuple from `combined` minus the last item popped, `current_profit` is reduced by the first element of `removed_item`, and `item` is the last item popped from `combined`.**

Explanation: The code `current_profit -= removed_item[0]` subtracts the first element of `removed_item` from `current_profit`. The other variables (`heap` and `item`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
