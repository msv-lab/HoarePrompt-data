Postcondition: `current_profit`, `max_profit`, `heap`, `remaining_items`, `neg_prices`, `n`, and `bonuses` remain unchanged. If `item[0] + item[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, `current_profit` is reduced by `item[1]`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by `item[0]`. `heap` contains the last tuple from `combined` minus the last item popped, except for the item just pushed (which is `item`), and `remaining_items` is an empty list.
