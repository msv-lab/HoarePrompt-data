Output State: **`item` is the second last element of `combined`, `combined` is modified (one element less), `heap` is modified (pushed `removed_item` and popped the smallest element), `current_profit` is updated based on the condition `removed_item[0] + removed_item[1] >= 0`, if true, `current_profit` is decreased by `removed_item[1]`, otherwise increased by `item[1]`, `max_profit` is unchanged if `current_profit` is not greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` is set to the value of `current_profit`.**

Explanation: The code `removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)` performs two operations: it pushes `item` onto the heap and then pops the smallest element from the heap, assigning it to `removed_item`. This means:

- `item` becomes the second last element of `combined` because the last element was removed.
- `combined` is modified by one element less.
- `heap` is modified by pushing `item` and popping the smallest element.
- `current_profit` is updated based on the condition `removed_item[0] + removed_item[1] >= 0`. If the condition is true, `current_profit` is decreased by `removed_item[1]`; otherwise, it is increased by `item[1]` (since `item` is now the second last element).
- `max_profit` remains unchanged unless `current_profit` becomes greater than `max_profit`, in which case `max_profit` is set to `current_profit`.
