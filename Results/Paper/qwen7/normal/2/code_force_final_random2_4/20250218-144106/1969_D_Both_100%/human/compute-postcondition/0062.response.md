Postcondition: `item` is the second last element of `combined`, `combined` is modified (one element less), `heap` is modified (pushed `removed_item` and popped the smallest element), `current_profit` is decreased by `removed_item[0]`, and `max_profit` remains unchanged unless `current_profit` becomes greater than `max_profit`, in which case `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`.
