Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only object here is `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations of the loop.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop head object**: The variable `t` is given as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means that `int(input())` will read an integer from the input, and this integer will determine how many times the loop will run.

3. **Ensure the loop can execute**: For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must return a value that is a non-negative integer. Since `t` is guaranteed to be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `int(input())` will always return a valid integer for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjust the state**: The only state that needs to be adjusted is the one related to the input that will be read by `int(input())`. Therefore, we need to ensure that the input is within the specified range.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**.

However, since the loop will execute based on the input, we need to ensure that the input itself is within the specified range. Thus, the state should reflect that the input will be a valid integer within the specified range.

State: **The input to `int(input())` must be a positive integer such that \(1 \leq \text{input} \leq 10^4\)**.
