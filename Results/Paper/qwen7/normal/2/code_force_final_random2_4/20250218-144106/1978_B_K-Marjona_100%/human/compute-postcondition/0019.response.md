Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is an input integer.
   - `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.

2. **Expression to Evaluate:**
   - The expression to be evaluated and printed is `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.

3. **Determine the Value of `k`:**
   - Since `k` is defined as the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`, we need to consider two cases:
     - If `n <= b - a`, then `k = n`.
     - If `n > b - a`, then `k = b - a`.

4. **Evaluate the Expression Based on `k`:**
   - We will evaluate the expression for both possible values of `k`.

### Case 1: `k = n`
- If `n <= b - a`, then `k = n`.
- Substitute `k = n` into the expression:
  \[
  b * n - n * (n - 1) // 2 + (n - n) * a
  \]
  Simplifying this:
  \[
  b * n - n * (n - 1) // 2 + 0
  \]
  Which further simplifies to:
  \[
  b * n - n * (n - 1) // 2
  \]

### Case 2: `k = b - a`
- If `n > b - a`, then `k = b - a`.
- Substitute `k = b - a` into the expression:
  \[
  b * (b - a) - (b - a) * ((b - a) - 1) // 2 + (n - (b - a)) * a
  \]
  Simplifying this:
  \[
  b * (b - a) - (b - a) * (b - a - 1) // 2 + (n - b + a) * a
  \]

Given the initial state, we do not have specific values for `n`, `a`, and `b`, so we cannot simplify further without those values. However, the expression will be one of the two forms depending on the value of `k`.

### Final Output:
Output: **b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a (where k is the minimum value between n and b - a)**
