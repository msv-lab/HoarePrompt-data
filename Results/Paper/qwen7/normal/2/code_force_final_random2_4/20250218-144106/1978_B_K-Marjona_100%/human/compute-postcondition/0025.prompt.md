You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three positive integers n, a, and b such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        k = min(n, b - a)
        
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will continue to execute until all input test cases are processed. After all iterations, `n`, `a`, and `b` will hold the values provided by the last input test case, and `k` will be the minimum value between the final `n` and `b - a`. If `b` is less than or equal to `a` at the last iteration, `k` will be the minimum value between the final `n` and `b - a`. Otherwise, `k` will also be the minimum value between the final `n` and `b - a`. The output of each iteration is determined based on the current values of `n`, `a`, and `b`, and `k` is recalculated for each new set of inputs.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case consisting of three positive integers t, n, and a, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9. For each test case, if t is within the specified range, it checks the relationship between n and a, and returns "equal" if n equals a, "less" if n is less than a, and "greater" if n is greater than a. If t is out of the specified range, it returns an error message indicating that t is not valid.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
