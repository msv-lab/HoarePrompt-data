Postcondition: `n`, `a`, `b` are integers between 1 and 10^4, and `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then `k` remains the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`. If `b` is greater than `a`, `k` still remains the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.
