Output: **a * n (where a is an input integer and n is an input integer)**

Explanation:
- `a` is an input integer.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is defined as the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`, but this value of `k` is not used in the print statement.
- The print statement simply outputs the product of `a` and `n`, so the output is `a * n`.
