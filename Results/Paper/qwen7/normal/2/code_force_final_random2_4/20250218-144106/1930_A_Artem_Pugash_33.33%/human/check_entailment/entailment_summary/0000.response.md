Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the value of \( n \) and the list of \( 2n \) integers.
3. The integers are sorted in ascending order.
4. The program then iterates through the sorted list in pairs, taking the minimum of each pair and adding it to the total sum.
5. This approach ensures that the smallest available numbers are paired together at each step, which is optimal for maximizing the score since \(\min(x, y)\) is always less than or equal to both \(x\) and \(y\).

Given the problem statement and the execution summary, the program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the score by always pairing the smallest available numbers together.

Correctness: **True**
