Based on the initial state described:

- `numCases` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `numInteger` is an input integer.
- `numbers` is an empty list.
- `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of all pairs of integers taken from the original list `numbers`.

Given that `numbers` is an empty list, there are no pairs of integers to consider. Therefore, the sum of the minimum values of all pairs of integers taken from the original list `numbers` is 0.

Output: **0**
