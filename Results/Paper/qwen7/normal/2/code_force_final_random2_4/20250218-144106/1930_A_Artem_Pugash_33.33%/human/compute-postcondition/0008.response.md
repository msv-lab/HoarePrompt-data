Output State: **`numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a list with one less element, `suma` is 0, `a` is the first element of `numbers` before popping, `b` is the first element of `numbers` after popping.**

Explanation: The code `b = int(numbers.pop(0))` pops the first element from the list `numbers` and assigns it to `b`. After popping, the length of the list `numbers` decreases by one. The value of `a` is updated to be the value of `b` since `a` was defined as the first element of `numbers` before popping. All other variables remain unchanged.
