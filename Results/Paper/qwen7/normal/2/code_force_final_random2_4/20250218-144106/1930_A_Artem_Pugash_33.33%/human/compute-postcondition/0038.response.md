Output State: **`numCases` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` contains at least one element less than before, `a` is the first element of `numbers` before popping, `b` is the first element of `numbers` after popping, `suma` is `2 * min(a, b) + min(a, b)`; `b` is the first element of `numbers` after popping.**

Explanation: The code updates `suma` by adding `min(a, b)` to its current value. Since `suma` was previously `2 * min(a, b)`, the new value of `suma` becomes `2 * min(a, b) + min(a, b)`, which simplifies to `3 * min(a, b)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously described states.
