You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
def func():
    numCases = int(input())
    for i in range(numCases):
        numInteger = int(input())
        
        numbers = input().split()
        
        numbers.sort(reverse=False)
        
        suma = 0
        
        while numbers != []:
            a = int(numbers.pop(0))
            b = int(numbers.pop(0))
            suma += min(a, b)
        
        print(suma)
        
    #State: Output State: `numCases` is greater than or equal to the total number of iterations, `i` is `numCases`, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is an empty list, `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of all pairs of elements from the original `numbers` list.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `numbers` will be an empty list because each pair of elements has been processed exactly once. The variable `suma` will contain the sum of the minimum values from each pair of consecutive elements in the original `numbers` list. The value of `i` will be equal to `numCases`, as the loop runs for each case specified by `numCases`. The value of `numInteger` remains unchanged as it was input before the loop started and is not modified within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) and 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) for each n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). For each test case, it returns information based on the given integers.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
