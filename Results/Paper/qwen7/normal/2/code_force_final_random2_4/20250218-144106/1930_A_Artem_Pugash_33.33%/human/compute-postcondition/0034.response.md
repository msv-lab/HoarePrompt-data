Output State: **`numCases` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` contains at least one element less than before, `a` is the first element of `numbers` before popping, `b` is the first element of `numbers` after popping, `suma` is `min(a, b)` + `min(a, b)`**.

Explanation: The variable `suma` is updated by adding `min(a, b)` to its current value. Since `a` is the first element of `numbers` before popping and `b` is the first element of `numbers` after popping, `suma` now holds the value of `min(a, b)` added to itself, which is effectively `2 * min(a, b)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously described states.
