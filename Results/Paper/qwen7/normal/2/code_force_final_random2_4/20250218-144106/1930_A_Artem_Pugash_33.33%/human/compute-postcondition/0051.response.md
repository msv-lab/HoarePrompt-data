The loop condition is `numbers != []`, which means the loop will continue as long as the list `numbers` is not empty. For the loop to execute one more time, `numbers` must be non-empty.

Let's analyze the current state:
- `numCases` is greater than 1
- `i` is `numCases`
- `numInteger` is an input integer
- `numbers` is a non-empty sorted list of input integers with the first element removed
- `suma` is `min(a, b)`
- `a` is the first element of the original `numbers` list
- `b` is the first element of the original `numbers` list

For the loop to execute one more time, `numbers` must remain non-empty. Since `numbers` is a non-empty sorted list with the first element removed, removing one more element from this list would make it empty. Therefore, `numbers` must not lose its first element during the current iteration.

No other states need to be adjusted because they do not affect the loop condition directly.

State: **`numCases` is greater than 1, `i` is `numCases`, `numInteger` is an input integer, `numbers` is a non-empty sorted list of input integers (with the first element not removed yet), `suma` is `min(a, b)`, `a` is the first element of the original `numbers` list, `b` is the first element of the original `numbers` list**
