The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer t and 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}. It then sorts these integers in ascending order, iterates through them in pairs, calculates the sum of the minimum values from each pair, and prints the total sum. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the sum for each case.
