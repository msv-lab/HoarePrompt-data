Output State: **`j` is 1, `lex` is either less than 26 or between 0 and 52 (inclusive), and `arr` contains the elements 26, 26.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decremented by 26. Since `lex` was originally either less than 52 or between 28 and 78 (inclusive), subtracting 26 from these values results in `lex` being either less than 26 or between 0 and 52 (inclusive). The values of `j` and `arr` remain unchanged.
