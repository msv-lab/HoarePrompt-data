Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 2.
- `j` is 3.
- `cases` is a positive integer (though its exact value is not needed for the output).
- `temp` is a string containing the character corresponding to `chr(info[2][3] + 96)` repeated three times.

Let's break down the process step by step:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `i = 2`
   - `j = 3`
   - `temp` starts as an empty string initially, but it will be updated in the loop.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs for `j` iterations, where `j` is 3.
   - In each iteration, `temp` is updated by appending the character corresponding to `info[i][j] + 96` to itself.

3. **Character Calculation**:
   - Since `i` is 2 and `j` is 3, we need to find `info[2][3]`.
   - The character corresponding to `chr(info[2][3] + 96)` is determined by adding 96 to the value of `info[2][3]` and then converting it to a character using `chr`.

4. **String Construction**:
   - After 3 iterations, `temp` will contain this character repeated three times.

Given that `j` is 3 and the loop runs 3 times, `temp` will be constructed as follows:
- In the first iteration: `temp` becomes `chr(info[2][3] + 96)`
- In the second iteration: `temp` becomes `chr(info[2][3] + 96)chr(info[2][3] + 96)`
- In the third iteration: `temp` becomes `chr(info[2][3] + 96)chr(info[2][3] + 96)chr(info[2][3] + 96)`

Therefore, the final value of `temp` is the character corresponding to `chr(info[2][3] + 96)` repeated three times.

Output: **chr(info[2][3] + 96)chr(info[2][3] + 96)chr(info[2][3] + 96)**
