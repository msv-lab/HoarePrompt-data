Output State: **`j` is 1, `lex` is an integer, and `arr` contains the element 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `arr.append(1)` appends the integer `1` to the list `arr`. This operation does not affect the values of `j` or `lex`. Therefore, `j` remains `1`, `lex` remains an integer, and `arr` now contains the element `1`.
