Output State: **The loop executes 3 times in total, with `j` being 2. `lex` is either `lex - 2` or `lex - 27`. The list `arr` contains the elements [1, 26, 26, lex - 2] or [1, 26, 26, lex - 27], and `arr` is sorted.**

Explanation: The `arr.sort()` function sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. Given the initial conditions, the smallest element in the list is always 1, followed by 26, 26. The fourth element is either `lex - 2` or `lex - 27`. Sorting the list means placing the smallest elements first, so the list will be `[1, 26, 26, lex - 2]` if `lex - 2` is smaller than `lex - 27`, or `[1, 26, 26, lex - 27]` if `lex - 27` is smaller than `lex - 2`. The loop and `j` remain unchanged.
