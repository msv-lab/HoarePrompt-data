Output State: **`arr` is sorted in ascending order; `info` contains a list which is a copy of `arr`**.

Explanation: The code appends the list `arr` to the list `info`. Since `arr` is sorted in ascending order, the list that gets appended to `info` is also a sorted list in ascending order, which is a copy of `arr`. The initial state of `arr` being sorted in ascending order remains unchanged, and now `info` holds a new list that is a copy of `arr`.
