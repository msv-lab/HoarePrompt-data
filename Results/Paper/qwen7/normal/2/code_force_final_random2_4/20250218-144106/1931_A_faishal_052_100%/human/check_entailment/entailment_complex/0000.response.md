Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Constructing `arr`:**
   - The logic used to construct `arr` is flawed. Specifically, the conditions for appending values to `arr` do not accurately reflect the problem statement. The problem requires finding the lexicographically smallest word that sums to `n`.
   - The current logic attempts to break down `lex` into parts of 26 and 1, which is not aligned with the goal of finding the smallest word.

2. **Sorting and Appending `lex`:**
   - The `arr` is sorted and then appended with `lex`, but this does not ensure that the resulting word is the lexicographically smallest possible word that sums to `n`.

3. **Constructing the Word:**
   - The construction of the word from `arr` is also incorrect. The code simply appends characters based on the sorted values in `arr`, which does not guarantee the smallest lexicographical order.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
