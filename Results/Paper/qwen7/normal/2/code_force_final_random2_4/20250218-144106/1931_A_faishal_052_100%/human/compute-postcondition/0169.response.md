Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `cases`.
2. **Determine the current state after the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 3.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `cases` must be a positive integer.
   - `temp` is a string containing the characters corresponding to `info[1][0] + 96`, `info[2][0] + 96`, and `info[2][1] + 96`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in `range(cases)`. This means `i` will increment from 0 up to `cases-1`.

4. **Determine the next state for the loop to execute one more time**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `cases`.
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 4.
   - Therefore, `cases` must remain a positive integer and `i` must be 4.
   - `j` does not change within the loop and remains 2.
   - `temp` does not change within the loop and remains the same string.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` needs to be 4.
   - `cases` must still be a positive integer.
   - `j` remains 2.
   - `temp` remains the same string.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `i` is 4, `j` is 2, `cases` must be a positive integer, `temp` is a string containing the characters corresponding to `info[1][0] + 96`, `info[2][0] + 96`, and `info[2][1] + 96`.**
