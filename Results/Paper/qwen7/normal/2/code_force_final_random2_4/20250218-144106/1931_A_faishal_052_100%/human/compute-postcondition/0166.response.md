Output State: `i` is 3, `j` is 2, `cases` must be a positive integer, `temp` is a string containing the characters corresponding to `info[1][0] + 96`, `info[2][0] + 96`, and `info[2][1] + 96`, with each character added sequentially in the loop.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `i` will be 3 because the loop runs for each element in the first dimension of `info` up to the second last element. The variable `j` will be 2 because the inner loop runs 3 times, and after the third iteration, `j` will be at its maximum value of 2. The variable `cases` remains a positive integer as it was not altered within the loop. The variable `temp` will contain the concatenated string of characters derived from `info[1][0] + 96`, `info[2][0] + 96`, and `info[2][1] + 96`.
