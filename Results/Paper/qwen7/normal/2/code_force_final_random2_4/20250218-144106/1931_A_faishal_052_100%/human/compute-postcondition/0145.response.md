Output State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is either `lex - 27` or `lex - 26`, `arr` contains the elements 26, 26**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decreased by 26. Since `lex` was either `lex - 1` or `lex - 26` initially, after subtracting 26, `lex` becomes either `(lex - 1) - 26` or `(lex - 26) - 26`. The values of `j` and `arr` remain unchanged.
