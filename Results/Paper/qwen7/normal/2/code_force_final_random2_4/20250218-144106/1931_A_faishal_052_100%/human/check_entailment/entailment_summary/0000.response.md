Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the lexicographically smallest word that could have been encoded. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Constructing the Array `arr`:**
   - The program attempts to construct an array `arr` based on certain conditions, but these conditions do not accurately reflect the encoding process.
   - Specifically, the conditions for appending values to `arr` are overly simplistic and do not cover all possible cases.

2. **Sorting the Array `arr`:**
   - After constructing `arr`, the program sorts it. However, sorting is not necessary for finding the lexicographically smallest word, and it might interfere with the correct construction of the word.

3. **Character Conversion:**
   - The program converts the first three elements of the sorted array back to characters using `chr(info[i][j] + 96)`. This conversion is correct, but the preceding issues mean that the array `arr` is not constructed correctly.

4. **Handling All Possible Encodings:**
   - The program does not handle all possible encodings correctly. For example, it fails to account for cases where the first two letters are 'z' and the third letter is less than 26.

Given these issues, the program will not produce the correct lexicographically smallest word for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
