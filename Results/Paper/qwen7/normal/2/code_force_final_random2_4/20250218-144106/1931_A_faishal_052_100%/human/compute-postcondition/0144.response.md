Output State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is either `lex - 1` or `lex - 26`, `arr` contains the elements 26, 26**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(26)` adds the value 26 to the list `arr`. Since `arr` initially contained the element 26, after appending another 26, `arr` now contains the elements 26, 26. The values of `j` and `lex` remain unchanged.
