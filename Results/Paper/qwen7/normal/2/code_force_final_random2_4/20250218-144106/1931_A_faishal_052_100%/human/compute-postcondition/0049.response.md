Output State: **The loop will execute 3 times since the range is specified as 2, which means it runs from 0 to 1 inclusive. After all iterations, `j` will be 1, `lex` will be either less than 52 or between -26 and 52 (inclusive), and `arr` will contain the elements 26, 26, 26. If `lex` was less than 28 at the start, it will be either less than 26 or between -26 and 26 (inclusive) after the loop. If `lex` was 28 or more, it will be reduced by 78 (26 * 3) and will still be within the range of -26 to 52.**

This output state describes the final conditions of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations.
