Output State: **`j` is 1; `lex` is either less than 26 or between -26 and 26 (inclusive); `arr` contains the elements 26, 26, 26**.

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decreased by 26. Since `lex` was originally either less than 52 or between -26 and 52 (inclusive), subtracting 26 from `lex` shifts its range. Specifically, if `lex` was originally between -26 and 26 (inclusive), it will now be between -52 and 0 (inclusive). If `lex` was originally between 27 and 52 (inclusive), it would fall outside the original range, which is not possible given the initial conditions. Therefore, `lex` is now either less than 26 or between -26 and 26 (inclusive). The values of `j` and `arr` remain unchanged.
