Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, `info` is a list containing [26, 26, 26], `i` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration and `k < cases
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex < 28:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    elif lex <= 78:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `lex` is an integer and `arr` is a list. If `lex` is less than 27, then `arr` contains the element 1. If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), then `arr` contains the element 26 and `lex` is an integer between 2 and 25. If `lex` is between 52 and 77 (inclusive), then `arr` contains the element 26. If `lex` is greater than 78, then the value of `lex` and the state of `arr` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `lex` is an integer and `arr` is a list. If `lex` is less than 27, then `arr` contains the element 1. If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), then `arr` contains the element 26 and `lex` is an integer between 2 and 25. If `lex` is between 52 and 77 (inclusive), then `arr` contains the element 26. If `lex` is greater than 78, the value of `lex` and the state of `arr` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `lex` is an integer and `arr` is a list. If `lex` is less than or equal to 78, then:
- If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` contains the element 1.
- If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` contains the element 26 and `lex` is an integer between 2 and 25.
- If `lex` is between 52 and 77 (inclusive), `arr` contains the element 26.
- If `lex` is greater than 78, the value of `lex` and the state of `arr` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
