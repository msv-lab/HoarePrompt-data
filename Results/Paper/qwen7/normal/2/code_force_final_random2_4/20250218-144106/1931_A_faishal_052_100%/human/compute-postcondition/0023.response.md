Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(2)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `j`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than 2.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` must be less than 2.
   - `lex` is either less than 52 or between 28 and 78 (inclusive).
   - `arr` contains the element 26.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is in the range of 0 to 1 (inclusive), after the first iteration, `j` will be incremented to 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than 2, which it already is.
   - The value of `lex` and the contents of `arr` do not change within the loop head and are not affected by the loop itself.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j`, which should be set to 1 for the loop to continue.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`j` is 1, `lex` is either less than 52 or between 28 and 78 (inclusive), and `arr` contains the element 26**.
