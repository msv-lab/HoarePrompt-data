Output State: **`j` is 2; `lex` is either `lex - 1` or `lex - 26`; `arr` contains the elements 26, 26**

Explanation: The code snippet `arr.append(26)` appends the value `26` to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` contains the element `26`. After appending `26` again, `arr` now contains the elements `26, 26`. The values of `j` and `lex` remain unchanged.
