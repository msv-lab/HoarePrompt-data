Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` must be between 0 and 2 (inclusive), `cases` must be a positive integer, `temp` is a string containing the character corresponding to `info[i][j] + 96`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `temp` by concatenating it with the character obtained from `info[i][j] + 96`. Since `i` was initially 0 and the code increments `i` by 1, `i` becomes 1. The value of `j` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it. The value of `cases` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the operation. The value of `temp` changes to a string containing the character corresponding to `info[0][j] + 96`, where `j` is still between 0 and 2 inclusive.
