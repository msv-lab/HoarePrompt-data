Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 0, `cases` must be a positive integer, `temp` is a string containing the character corresponding to `info[1][0] + 96` + the character corresponding to `info[2][0] + 96`.**

Explanation: The code updates `temp` by concatenating it with the character obtained from `chr(info[i][j] + 96)`. Initially, `i` is 1 and `j` is 0, so `temp` is updated with the character from `info[1][0] + 96`. After this operation, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 2, while `j` remains 0. The value of `cases` and the initial value of `temp` remain unchanged.
