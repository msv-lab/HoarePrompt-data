Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 3, `cases` must be a positive integer, `temp` is a string containing the character corresponding to `chr(info[2][3] + 96)` + `chr(info[2][3] + 96)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `temp` by concatenating it with `chr(info[i][j] + 96)`. Given that `i` is 2 and `j` is 3, the expression `info[2][3] + 96` is evaluated and then passed to `chr()` to get the corresponding character. This character is then concatenated to `temp`. Since the initial value of `temp` is a string containing the character corresponding to `chr(info[2][3] + 96)`, after the operation, `temp` will contain this character twice. All other variables remain unchanged.
