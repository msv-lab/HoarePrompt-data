Output State: **`lex` is an integer with a value greater than or equal to 52 and less than or equal to 78; `arr` is a list containing the element 26**.

Explanation: The code `arr.append(26)` adds the integer 26 to the list `arr`. Since `lex` is unchanged and its value range (greater than or equal to 52 and less than or equal to 78) remains the same, the only new information is that `arr` now contains the element 26.
