Output State: `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `cases` must be a positive integer, `temp` is a string containing the character corresponding to `chr(info[2][3] + 96)` repeated three times.

Explanation: The loop runs for 3 iterations since `j` is in the range of 3 (0 to 2). In each iteration, `temp` is updated by appending the character corresponding to `info[i][j] + 96` to itself. After 3 iterations, `temp` will contain the character corresponding to `info[2][3] + 96` repeated three times. The value of `i` remains 2 because the loop does not modify `i`. `j` remains 3 as it is not modified within the loop and the loop condition is based on `j` being less than 3, which is no longer true after 3 iterations. `cases` remains a positive integer as it is not affected by the loop.
