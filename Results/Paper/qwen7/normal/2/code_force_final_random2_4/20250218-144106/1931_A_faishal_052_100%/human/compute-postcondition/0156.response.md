Output State: The loop will execute `cases` times in total. After all iterations, `arr` will contain `cases + 1` elements. The first `cases` elements of `arr` will be sorted in ascending order and can be either 1 or 26 depending on the value of `lex` during each iteration. The last element of `arr` will be the final value of `lex` after all iterations. `info` will be a list containing a single list, which is the final state of `arr` after sorting.

In more detail, `arr` will look like this: `[1, 26, ..., 26, final_lex_value]` where the number of 26s is equal to the number of times the condition `lex < 28` was met minus one (since `lex` is decremented by 1 or 26 each time), and the final value of `lex` will be the last element. The list `info` will contain a single list which is the sorted version of `arr` as described above.
