Output State: `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `cases` must be a positive integer, `temp` is a string containing the character corresponding to `chr(info[2][3] + 96)` repeated three times.

Explanation: The loop runs for each value of `j` in the range(3), which means it will run exactly 3 times. After each iteration, `temp` gets concatenated with the character corresponding to `info[i][j] + 96`. Since `i` remains 2 throughout the loop (as it is not modified within the loop), `temp` will end up being the character corresponding to `info[2][3] + 96` repeated three times. The other variables (`i`, `j`, and `cases`) remain unchanged as per the problem statement.
