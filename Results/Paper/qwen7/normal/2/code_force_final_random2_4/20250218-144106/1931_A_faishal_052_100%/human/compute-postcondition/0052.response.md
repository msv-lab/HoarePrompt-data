Output State: **`arr` is [26, 26, 26]; `lex` is either less than 26 or between -26 and 26 (inclusive); `info` is a list containing `[26, 26, 26]`.**

The code appends the list `arr` to the list `info`. Since `arr` is `[26, 26, 26]`, `info` now contains this list. The values of `arr` and `lex` remain unchanged from their initial states.
