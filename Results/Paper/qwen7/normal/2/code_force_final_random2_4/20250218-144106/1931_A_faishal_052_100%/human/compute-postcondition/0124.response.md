Postcondition: `j` is 0, `lex` is an integer, and `arr` is a list. If `lex` is less than 27, then `arr` contains the element 1. Otherwise, if `lex` is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `arr` contains the element 26, and `lex` remains unchanged if it is less than 52, otherwise it is updated to `lex - 26`.
