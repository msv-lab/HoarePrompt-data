Output State: **`arr` is no longer sorted in ascending order; `info` contains a list which is a copy of the original `arr`; `i` is `i_prev + 1`; `lex` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer from the user input and assigns it to the variable `lex`. The values of `arr`, `info`, and `i` remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, `arr` is no longer sorted in ascending order, `info` still contains a list which is a copy of the original `arr`, and `i` is `i_prev + 1`. The new variable `lex` holds the value of the integer input by the user.
