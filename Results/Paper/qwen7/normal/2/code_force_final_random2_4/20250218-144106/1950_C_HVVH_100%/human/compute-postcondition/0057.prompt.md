You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, and for each test case, s is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in the 24-hour format where hh is the hour from 00 to 23 and mm is the minute from 00 to 59.
def func():
    day = 'AM'
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))
        
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
            if h == 12:
                day = 'PM'
        
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `n` is 0 (since it was decremented by 1 each iteration until it reached 0), `h` is an integer between 1 and 12, and `m` is an integer.
    #
    #In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have completed, `n` has been reduced to 0. The values of `t`, `day`, `h`, and `m` remain as they were last modified within the loop. `t` and `m` are unaffected by the loop since they are not used inside the loop, while `day` and `h` are adjusted based on the input provided during each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes an integer `t` (where 1 <= t <= 1440) and a string `s` (in the format "hh:mm") representing a valid time. It returns a specific value based on the conditions provided.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
