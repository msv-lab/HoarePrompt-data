Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1440, `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `n` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1, `h` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is an integer. If `h` is 0, then `h` is set to 12 and `day` is set to 'AM'. Otherwise, if `h` is greater than 12, `h` is decreased by 12 and `day` is set to 'PM'.
