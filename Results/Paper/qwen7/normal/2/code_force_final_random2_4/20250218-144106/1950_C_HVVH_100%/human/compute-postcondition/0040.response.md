Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1440, `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `n` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1, `h` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is an integer, `h` is converted to an integer from the input split by ':', and `m` is converted to an integer from the input split by ':'**.

The code takes two inputs separated by a colon (`:`) and splits them into two integers, updating the values of `h` and `m`. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
