Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `day` is 'AM', `n` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1, `h` is 12, `m` is an integer**.

Explanation: The code simply reassigns the value of `day` to 'AM'. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `n` is decremented by 1, but since the initial state only stated that `n` is greater than 0, we keep that condition without specifying the exact value.
