Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `n` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1, `h` is an integer between 1 and 12 decreased by 12, `m` is an integer**.

Explanation: The code `h = h - 12` decreases the value of `h` by 12. Since `h` was originally an integer between 1 and 12, subtracting 12 from it means `h` will now be a negative number (specifically, between -11 and 0). All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
