Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\), `day` is either 'AM' or 'PM', `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is adjusted to be within the range of 1 to 12, and `m` is an input integer. If `h` is 0, then `h` is set to 12. If `h` is greater than 12, then `day` changes to 'PM', otherwise `day` remains 'AM'.
