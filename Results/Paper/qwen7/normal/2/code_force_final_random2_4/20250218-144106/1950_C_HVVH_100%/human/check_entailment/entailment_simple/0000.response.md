Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
2. For each test case, the program extracts the hour `h` and minute `m` from the input string `s` in the format "hh:mm".
3. The logic for converting the 24-hour format to the 12-hour format is as follows:
   - If `h` is 0, it is converted to 12 and the `day` is set to 'AM'.
   - If `h` is greater than 12, it is subtracted by 12 and the `day` is set to 'PM'.
   - Otherwise, `day` is set to 'AM', and if `h` is 12, it is set to 'PM'.
4. The program prints the time in the required format "hh:mm AM/PM".
5. The provided comments and the final state of the program indicate that the program correctly handles all edge cases, including midnight (00:00) and noon (12:00).

Given the above analysis, the program correctly converts the 24-hour format to the 12-hour format for all valid inputs as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
