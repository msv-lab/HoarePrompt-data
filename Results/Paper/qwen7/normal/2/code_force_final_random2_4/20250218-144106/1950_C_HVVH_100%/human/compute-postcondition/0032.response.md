Output State: **`day` is 'PM', `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\), `n` must be greater than 0, `h` is an integer between 1 and 12, `m` is an integer.**

The code simply changes the value of `day` from 'AM' to 'PM'. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `h`, and `m`) remain unchanged with their respective conditions and ranges intact.
