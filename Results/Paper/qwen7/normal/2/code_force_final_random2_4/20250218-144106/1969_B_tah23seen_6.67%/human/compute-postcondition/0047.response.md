The loop head consists of two conditions: `left < len(s)` and `s[left] != '1'`. For the loop to execute the first time, both conditions must be true.

1. The variable `left` is currently set to `len(s) - 1`.
2. The variable `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, and `s[left]` is the last character of `sChar`.

For the loop to execute the first time:
- The first condition `left < len(s)` must be true. Since `left` is initially `len(s) - 1`, it is already less than `len(s)`, so no adjustment is needed for this part.
- The second condition `s[left] != '1'` must be true. Since `s[left]` is the last character of `sChar`, and `sChar` is a non-empty binary string, `s[left]` could either be '0' or '1'. To satisfy the condition `s[left] != '1'`, `s[left]` must be '0'.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `sChar` such that its last character is '0'.

State: **`sChar` is a non-empty binary string ending with '0', `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is equal to the length of the list `s` minus 1, `cost` is 4, `right` is equal to the length of `s`**
