Output State: `sChar` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is 1, `cost` is 2, `right` is equal to the length of `s`, and all characters from `s[1]` to `s[right-1]` must not be '0'.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `right` will be equal to the length of the list `s`, indicating that the loop has processed all characters in `s` starting from index 1. Additionally, none of the characters from `s[1]` to `s[right-1]` (which is the entire range of `s` except the first character) can be '0'. The values of `left` and `cost` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
