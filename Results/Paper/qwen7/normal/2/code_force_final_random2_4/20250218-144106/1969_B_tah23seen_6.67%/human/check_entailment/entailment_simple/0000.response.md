Reasoning:
1. The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the while loop inside `func_1` does not correctly identify and perform the necessary cyclic shifts to sort the binary string in non-descending order.
2. The logic inside the while loop seems to be trying to find and swap '1's and '0's, but it does not handle the cyclic shift properly. It incorrectly updates `left` and `right` and does not ensure that the string is sorted.
3. The example provided in the comments for the third test case (`101011`) suggests that the expected cost is 9, but the current implementation returns a cost of 16, which is incorrect.
4. The overall structure of the code does not align with the problem statement. The problem requires finding the minimum cost to sort the binary string, and the provided solution does not achieve this.

Given these points, the annotated program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
