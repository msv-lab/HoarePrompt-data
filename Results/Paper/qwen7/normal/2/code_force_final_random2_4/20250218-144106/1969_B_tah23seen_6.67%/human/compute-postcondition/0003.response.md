Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in sChar:`.
   - The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `sChar`.

2. **Understand the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `sChar` is a non-empty binary string.
   - `i` is each character in `sChar`.
   - `s` is a list containing each character of `sChar`.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next character in `sChar`.
   - Since `sChar` is a non-empty binary string, it will always have at least one character left to iterate over.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `sChar` remains the same as it is the iterable object.
   - `i` will be the next character in `sChar`.
   - `s` remains unchanged as it is populated during the loop execution but not modified within the loop itself.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `i` is now the next character in `sChar`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`sChar` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is the next character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing each character of `sChar`**
