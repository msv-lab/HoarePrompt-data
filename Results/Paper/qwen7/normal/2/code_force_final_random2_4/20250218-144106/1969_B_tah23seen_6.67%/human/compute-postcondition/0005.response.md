Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `sChar`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in `sChar`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sChar` is a non-empty binary string.
   - `i` is the next character in `sChar`.
   - `s` is a list containing each character of `sChar` with the additional character `i`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as there are characters left in `sChar`, we need to ensure that `sChar` still contains at least one character.
   - After the current iteration, `i` would be the next character in `sChar`, meaning `sChar` will now be one character shorter.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `sChar` must now be a non-empty binary string, but it will be one character shorter than before.
   - `i` will be the next character in the updated `sChar`.
   - The list `s` remains unchanged because it already includes all characters from the previous `sChar` plus the current `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`sChar` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is the next character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing each character of the original `sChar` with the additional character `i`**.
