Output State: `sChar` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is equal to the length of the list `s`, `cost` is 2, `right` is equal to the length of `s`, and for every index `j` from 0 to `len(s)-1`, `s[j]` must not be '0'.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `left` will be equal to the length of the list `s`. This is because the loop continues to increment `left` as long as `left` is less than the length of `s` and `s[left]` is not '1'. Since the loop processes all characters in `s` (as indicated by the initial conditions and the behavior of the loop), `left` will eventually become equal to the length of `s`. None of the characters in `s` are '0' because the loop only increments `right` (and implicitly `left`) when `s[right]` (or `s[left]`) is not '0'. The values of `cost` and `right` remain unchanged at 2 and the length of `s`, respectively.
