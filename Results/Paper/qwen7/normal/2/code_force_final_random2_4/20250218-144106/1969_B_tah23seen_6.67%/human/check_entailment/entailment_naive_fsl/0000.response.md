Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. Specifically, the logic in the `func_1` function does not handle all cases correctly. For instance, consider the input string `101011`. The expected output is 9, but the current implementation does not achieve this result. Here is a breakdown of why the current implementation fails:

1. The current implementation tries to swap characters based on the condition `if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1'`, which is not sufficient to cover all possible scenarios for achieving the minimum cost.
2. The logic for finding the next '0' and '1' positions and swapping them is flawed because it does not account for the cyclic nature of the shifts and the optimal way to minimize the total cost.

A correct approach would involve identifying the longest prefix that is already sorted and then calculating the cost of making the rest of the string sorted through cyclic shifts. This requires a more sophisticated algorithm that considers the cyclic nature of the shifts and the optimal way to minimize the total cost.
