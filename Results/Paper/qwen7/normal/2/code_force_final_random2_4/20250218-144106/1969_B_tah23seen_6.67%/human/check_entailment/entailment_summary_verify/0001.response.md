### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to sort a binary string in non-descending order with the minimum total cost. The cost of an operation is the length of the substring that is cyclically shifted.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1(s)` to compute the minimum cost.
   - The function `func_1(s)`:
     - Converts the string `sChar` into a list of characters.
     - Initializes `left` and `right` pointers and a `cost` variable.
     - Iterates through the string to find positions where a swap can reduce the cost.
     - Swaps characters when a '0' is found to the left of a '1' and updates the cost.
     - Moves the `left` and `right` pointers appropriately to find the next possible swaps.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1(s)` seems to correctly identify positions where a swap can be made to reduce the cost.
   - However, there is a critical issue with the function summary provided. The summary states that the function calculates and returns a cost value of 16, but the actual implementation does not reflect this. Instead, the function correctly calculates the minimum cost based on the positions of '0's and '1's.

4. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function summary claims that the function returns a fixed cost of 16, which is incorrect. The actual function calculates the minimum cost based on the positions of '0's and '1's in the string.
   - The function does not perform any cyclic shifts; it simply swaps characters to move '1's to the left and '0's to the right. This is a different approach from performing cyclic shifts.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string is already sorted, the function returns 0, which is correct.
   - If the string has no '1's or '0's, the function will also return 0, which is correct.
   - The function handles the cyclic shift by swapping characters directly, which is a valid approach, but it does not perform cyclic shifts as described in the problem statement.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts. Instead, it uses direct swaps, which is a different approach.
   - The function summary is incorrect, and the implementation does not match the expected behavior of the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not perform the required cyclic shifts as specified in the problem statement. Instead, it performs direct swaps, which is a different approach and does not necessarily yield the minimum cost for cyclic shifts.
