Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop condition is `left < len(s) and s[left] != '1'`.
2. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: 
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions in the loop head must be true.
   - The first condition is `left < len(s)`.
   - The second condition is `s[left] != '1'`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sChar` is a non-empty binary string ending with '0'.
   - `i` is the last character in `sChar`.
   - `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`.
   - `left` is equal to the length of the list `s`.
   - `cost` is 8.
   - `right` is equal to the length of `s`.
   - `left` is increased by 1.

4. **Analyze the current state**:
   - Since `left` is initially equal to the length of the list `s`, and it is increased by 1, `left` is now `len(s) + 1`.
   - This means `left` is no longer less than `len(s)` because `left` is now `len(s) + 1`, which is greater than `len(s)`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - To make the loop execute one more time, `left` must be less than `len(s)`.
   - Therefore, `left` must be set to a value that is less than `len(s)`.

Since `left` is increased by 1, we need to set `left` to a value that is less than `len(s)` before the loop starts. However, based on the given information, we cannot directly change `left` to a value less than `len(s)` without knowing the exact value of `len(s)`. But we know that `left` was `len(s)` before it was incremented, so we need to ensure that `left` is less than `len(s)` for the loop to continue.

Given the constraints, the only adjustment we can make is to ensure that `left` is less than `len(s)`.

**State:**
State: **`sChar` is a non-empty binary string ending with '0', `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` must be less than `len(s)`, `cost` is 8, `right` is equal to the length of `s`**
