Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `sChar` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is equal to the length of the list `s` minus 1, `cost` is 4, `right` is equal to the length of `s`.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the condition `right < len(s)` will no longer be satisfied because `right` will be equal to the length of `s`. This means the loop has finished executing. At this point, `right` will be set to `len(s)`, which is the same as `right + 1` since `right` was incremented in the loop until it reached the length of `s`. Therefore, the final state of `right` is equal to the length of `s`, and none of the other variables (`sChar`, `i`, `s`, `left`, `cost`) are affected by the loop and thus remain unchanged from their last known state before the loop started.
Code of the loop:
while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
    left += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `sChar` is a non-empty binary string ending with '0', `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is equal to the length of the list `s`, `cost` is 4, `right` is equal to the length of `s`, `left` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `sChar` is a non-empty binary string ending with '0', `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is equal to the length of the list `s` + 2, `cost` is 4, `right` is equal to the length of `s`
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `sChar` is a non-empty binary string ending with '0', `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is equal to the length of the list `s` + 3, `cost` is 4, `right` is equal to the length of `s`


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
