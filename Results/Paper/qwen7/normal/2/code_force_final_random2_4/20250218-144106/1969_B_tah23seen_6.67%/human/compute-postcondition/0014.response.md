Output State: **`sChar` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is 1, `cost` is 0, `right` is 0, the current value of `s[right]` is '1', and the current value of `s[left]` is '0'.**

Explanation: The code swaps the characters at positions `left` and `right` in the list `s`. Initially, `s[left]` was '1' and `s[right]` was '0'. After the swap, `s[left]` becomes '0' and `s[right]` becomes '1'. The values of `i`, `sChar`, `s`, `cost`, `left`, and `right` (except for their swapped positions) remain unchanged.
