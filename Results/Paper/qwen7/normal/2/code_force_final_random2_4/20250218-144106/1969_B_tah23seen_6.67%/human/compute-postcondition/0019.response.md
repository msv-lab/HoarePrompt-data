Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':`. The variables involved here are `right` and `s`.

2. **Analyze the conditions**:
   - The loop continues as long as `right < len(s)` and `s[right] != '0'`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `right < len(s)` must be true initially.
   - Additionally, the condition `s[right] != '0'` must be true for the first iteration.

3. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `sChar` is a non-empty binary string.
   - `i` is the last character in `sChar`.
   - `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`.
   - `left` is 1.
   - `cost` is 2.
   - `right` is 0.
   - The conditions: if the character at position `right` (which is `s[0]`) is '0' and the character at position `left` (which is `s[1]`) is '1', then `left` is set to 1 and `cost` is set to 2; otherwise, no changes are made to `left` and `cost`.

4. **Adjusting the state**:
   - Since `right` is currently 0, we need to ensure that `s[0] != '0'` for the loop to execute the first time.
   - We do not need to change `left` or `cost` because they are not part of the loop head conditions.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `s[0]` must not be '0'.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`sChar` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is 1, `cost` is 2, `right` is 0, and `s[0]` must not be '0'**.
