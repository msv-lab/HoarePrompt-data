Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop condition is `right < len(s) and s[right] != '0'`.

2. **Determine which states need adjustment**:
   - `right < len(s)` ensures that `right` is within the bounds of the list `s`.
   - `s[right] != '0'` ensures that the character at position `right` is not '0'.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sChar` is a non-empty binary string.
   - `i` is the last character in `sChar`.
   - `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`.
   - `left` is equal to the length of the list `s` minus 1.
   - `cost` is 4.
   - `right` is equal to the length of `s` plus 1.
   - `s[right]` must not be '0'.

4. **Adjusting the states**:
   - Since `right` is currently equal to the length of `s` plus 1, the condition `right < len(s)` is false.
   - To make the loop execute one more time, `right` must be within the bounds of `s` and the character at `right` must not be '0'.
   - Therefore, `right` must be adjusted to be within the bounds of `s` (i.e., `right` should be less than the length of `s`) and the character at `right` must not be '0'.

5. **Final state**:
   - `right` must be adjusted to be within the bounds of `s` and the character at `right` must not be '0'.

Thus, the final state to proceed to the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`sChar` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is equal to the length of the list `s` minus 1, `cost` is 4, `right` must be within the bounds of `s` and `s[right]` must not be '0'**.
