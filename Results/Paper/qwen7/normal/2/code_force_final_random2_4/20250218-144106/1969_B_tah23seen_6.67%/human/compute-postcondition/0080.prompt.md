You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: sChar is a binary string (a string consisting of only '0's and/or '1's) with a length between 2 and 200000.
def func_1(sChar):
    s = []
    for i in sChar:
        s.append(i)
        
    #State: Output State: `sChar` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`.
    #
    #In this final output state, the loop has executed for each character in the binary string `sChar`. The variable `s` now contains a list of all characters from `sChar`, in the order they appeared.
    left = 0
    cost = 0
    right = 1
    while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s)):
        if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1':
            s[right], s[left] = s[left], s[right]
            cost += right - left + 1
        
        while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
            right += 1
        
        while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
            left += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `sChar` is a non-empty binary string ending with '0', `i` is the last character in `sChar`, `s` is a list containing every character of `sChar`, `left` is equal to the length of the list `s`, `cost` is 16, `right` is equal to the length of `s`.
    #
    #Explanation: After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `right` will be equal to the length of the list `s`. This is because the loop continues to increment `right` as long as `right` is less than the length of `s` and `s[right]` is not '0'. Once `right` reaches the length of `s` or `s[right]` becomes '0', the condition `right < len(s) and s[right] != '0'` fails, and the loop terminates. The loop also increments `cost` by the value of `right - left + 1` each time it swaps a '0' and '1' and updates `left` and `right` accordingly. Since the loop runs three more times after the initial three iterations, and the cost doubles each time based on the problem's pattern, the final `cost` will be \(2^4 = 16\). The values of `sChar`, `i`, `s`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged from their final state after the third iteration, where `left` and `right` are both equal to the length of the list `s`.
    return cost
    #The program returns a cost of 16
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter sChar, which is a binary string with a length between 2 and 200000. It returns a cost of 16.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a cost of 16


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
