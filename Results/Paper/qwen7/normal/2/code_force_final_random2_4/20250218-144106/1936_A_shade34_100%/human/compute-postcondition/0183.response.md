Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, and `mak` is 1**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change the values of any variables. It only flushes the output buffer, which means it ensures that any buffered data is written out to the terminal or file immediately. Since no variables are assigned new values or their states are altered by this command, the initial conditions remain unchanged.
