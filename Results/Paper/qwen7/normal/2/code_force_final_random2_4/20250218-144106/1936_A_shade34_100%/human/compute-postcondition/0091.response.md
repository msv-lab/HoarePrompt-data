Output State: **`mak` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, a string is '<'**

Explanation: The line `mak = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is 1) to `mak`. After this assignment, `i` is incremented by 1, making its new value 2. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
