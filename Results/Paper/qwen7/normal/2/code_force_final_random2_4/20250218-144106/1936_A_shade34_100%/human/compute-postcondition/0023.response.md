Output State: `mak` is an integer between 0 and n-1 (inclusive), `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), and `n` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations the loop executed. If the input string is '<' at any iteration where `i` is less than `mak`, then `mak` will be updated to `i`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `mak` will be set to the smallest index `i` for which the input was '<' during the loop's execution, or it will remain 0 if the input was never '<'. The variable `t` and the value of `n` will stay as they were initially, with `n` being at least as large as the number of iterations.
