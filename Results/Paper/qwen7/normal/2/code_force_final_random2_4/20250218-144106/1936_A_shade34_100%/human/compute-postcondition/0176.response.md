Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that any pending output is written to the console. However, this operation does not change the values of the variables `n` or `i`. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain unchanged.
