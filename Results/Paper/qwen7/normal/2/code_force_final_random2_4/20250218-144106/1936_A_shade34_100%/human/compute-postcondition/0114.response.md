Output State: **`i` is 0; `mak` is 0; `n` is greater than 1; `mak2` is equal to `n-1`; `pans` is an empty list; the current value of `s` is '<'**.

Explanation: The line `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 0) to the variable `mak`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
