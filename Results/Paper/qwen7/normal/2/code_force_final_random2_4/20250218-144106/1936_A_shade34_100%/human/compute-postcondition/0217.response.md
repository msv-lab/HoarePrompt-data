Output State: **`mak2` is equal to `mak`, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-2`, `mak` is `n`, `pans` is a list containing the elements `n-1` and `i`, `s` is an input string.**

Explanation: The code `pans.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `pans`. Given that `i` is `n-2`, the list `pans` now contains two elements: `n-1` (previously added) and `n-2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
