Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `i` in the range from 1 to `n`. Therefore, the variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mak` is 0.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `n` must be greater than 2.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be equal to the current value of `n-1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `n`.
   - `n` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same as the previous iteration.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `mak` remains 0.
   - `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `n` remains greater than 2.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:
State: **`mak` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), and `n` must be greater than 2**.
