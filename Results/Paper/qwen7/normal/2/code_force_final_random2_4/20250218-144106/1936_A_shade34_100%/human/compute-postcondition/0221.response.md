Postcondition: `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-2`, `mak` is `n`, `pans` is a list containing the elements `n-1` and `i`, `s` is an input string. If the input string `s` equals `'<'`, then `pans` remains unchanged. If the input string `s` equals `'='`, then `pans` is updated to include `i`.
