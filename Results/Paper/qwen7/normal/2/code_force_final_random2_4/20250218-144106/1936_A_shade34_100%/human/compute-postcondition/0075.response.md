Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `len(pans)`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(pans)`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mak` is equal to `i`.
   - A string read from input is either greater than '>', or the input operation completes without further changes to variables.
   - `len(pans)` must be greater than `i`.
   - `sys.stdout.flush()` is executed.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `i < len(pans)`, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `i + 1`.
   - `mak` will now be equal to the new value of `i` (i.e., `mak` becomes `i + 1`).
   - The condition `len(pans) > i` still holds true since `len(pans)` remains unchanged.
   - `sys.stdout.flush()` will be executed again.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `mak` is now equal to `i + 1`.
   - A string read from input is either greater than '>', or the input operation completes without further changes to variables.
   - `len(pans)` must still be greater than `i + 1`.
   - `sys.stdout.flush()` is executed.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`mak` is equal to `i + 1`, a string read from input is either greater than '>', or the input operation completes without further changes to variables, `len(pans)` must be greater than `i + 1`, and `sys.stdout.flush()` is executed.**
