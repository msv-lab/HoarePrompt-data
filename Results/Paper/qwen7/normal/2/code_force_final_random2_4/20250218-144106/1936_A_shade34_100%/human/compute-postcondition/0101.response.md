Based on the initial state provided:

- `mak` is explicitly given as 1.
- `i` is explicitly given as 4.
- `n` must be greater than 3, but its exact value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

This will print the string `'?'` followed by the values of `mak` and `i`, repeated twice. Since `mak` is 1 and `i` is 4, the output will be:
Output: **'? 1 1 4 4'**
