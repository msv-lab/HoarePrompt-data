Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the variable `pans`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `len(pans) - 1` (since `range(1, len(pans))` means `i` starts at `1` and goes up to `len(pans) - 1`).

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `2`.
   - `len(pans)` is at least `1`.
   - If the input string is `'>',` then `mak` is `2`.
   - If the input string is not `'>',` then the values of `i`, `len(pans)`, and `mak` remain unchanged.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is currently `2`, the loop will continue if `i < len(pans)`.
   - Given that `len(pans)` is at least `1`, and `i` is `2`, the loop will continue as long as `len(pans) > 2`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by `1` in the next iteration, so `i` will become `3`.
   - `len(pans)` remains unchanged and is still at least `1`.
   - The value of `mak` remains unchanged based on the condition given.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: `i` is 3, `len(pans)` is at least 1, and `mak` retains its previous value.**
