Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 3, and `mak` is as per the precondition.**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that any pending output is written to the console. However, this operation does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `i`, and `mak`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
