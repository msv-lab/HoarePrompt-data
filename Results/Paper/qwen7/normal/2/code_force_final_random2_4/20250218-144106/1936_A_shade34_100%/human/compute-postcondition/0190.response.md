Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 3, `mak` is 3**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` (which is 3) to the variable `mak`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged, and the value of `i` is also unchanged. Therefore, `mak` now holds the value of `i`, which is 3.
