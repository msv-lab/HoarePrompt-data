Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n)`. This means the loop will iterate over values of `i` starting from 0 up to `n-1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop head variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `n`.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `mak2` is equal to `n-1`.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop `for i in range(n)` to execute, `i` must start from 0 and go up to `n-1`.
   - Given that `i` is initially set to `n`, the loop cannot execute because `i` is not within the range defined by `range(n)`.

4. **Adjust the state to allow the loop to execute**:
   - To allow the loop to execute, `i` must be set to 0 (the starting value of the range).
   - The other variables (`n`, `mak2`, and `pans`) do not affect the loop's ability to execute and can remain as they are.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `mak2` is equal to `n-1`, `pans` is an empty list**
