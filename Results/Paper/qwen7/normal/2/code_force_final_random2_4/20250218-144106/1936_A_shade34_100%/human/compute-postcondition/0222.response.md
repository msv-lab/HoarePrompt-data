Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`
   - `n` is greater than 1
   - `i` is `n-2`
   - `mak` is `n`
   - `pans` is a list containing the elements `n-1` and `i`
   - `s` is an input string

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `n-2` and increments by 1 each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1` or `(n-2) + 1 = n-1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `n-1` must be less than `n`, which is always true.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be updated to `n-1`.
   - `pans` will remain unchanged if `s == '<'` or will be updated to include `i` if `s == '='`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` will be `n-1`.
- `pans` will remain as `[n-1, i]` if `s == '<'` or will be updated to `[n-1, i, i]` if `s == '='`.

So, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`mak2` is equal to `mak`, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is `n`, `pans` is a list containing the elements `n-1` and `i` or `[n-1, i, i]` depending on the value of `s`, `s` is an input string.**
