Based on the initial state and the conditions provided, let's analyze the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is `3`.
   - `len(pans)` is at least `1`.
   - `mak` retains its previous value, which was `2` (from the previous iteration where `i` was `2`).

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

3. **Values of Variables**:
   - `i` is `3`.
   - `mak` is `2`.
   - `pans[mak]` (which is `pans[2]`) will have a specific value depending on the content of the `pans` list.
   - `pans[i]` (which is `pans[3]`) will also have a specific value depending on the content of the `pans` list.

Since the exact values of `pans` are not provided, we can only describe the indices and their respective positions in the list.

4. **Output**:
   - The print statement will output a string `'?'` followed by the value of `pans[2]` twice, and the value of `pans[3]` twice.

Output: **'? [pans[2]] [pans[2]] [pans[3]] [pans[3]]'**
