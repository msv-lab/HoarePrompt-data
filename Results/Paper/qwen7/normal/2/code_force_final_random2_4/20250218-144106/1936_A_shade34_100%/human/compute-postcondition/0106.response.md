Output State: **`mak` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is `n`.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `mak` will be the last value of `i` that was assigned to it, which is `n-1`, assuming that the condition `str(input()) == '<'` was met for the final assignment. The variable `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once. The variable `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop increments `i` from 1 up to `n-1`, and the final value of `i` before the loop ends is `n-1`, but since the loop condition checks `range(1, n)`, `i` will be `n` when the loop terminates.
