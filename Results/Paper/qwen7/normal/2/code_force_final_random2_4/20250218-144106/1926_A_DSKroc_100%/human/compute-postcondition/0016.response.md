Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive, `q` is 0, `ac` is either 1 or 0, `bc` is 1, and `s` is a non-empty input string. `i` is the next character in the string `s`.**

Explanation: The variable `bc` is incremented by 1, changing its value from its previous state (either 1 or 0) to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
