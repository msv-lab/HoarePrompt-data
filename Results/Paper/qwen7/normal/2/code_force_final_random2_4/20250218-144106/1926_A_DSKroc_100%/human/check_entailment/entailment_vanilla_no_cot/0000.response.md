Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine which character ('A' or 'B') appears most frequently in a string of length 5 for each test case. The program iterates through each character of the string, counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B', and then prints the character that appears more frequently. Given the constraints and the example provided, the program will produce the correct output for each test case.
