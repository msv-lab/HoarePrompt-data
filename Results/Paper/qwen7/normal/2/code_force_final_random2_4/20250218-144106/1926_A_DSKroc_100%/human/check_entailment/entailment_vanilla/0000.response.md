### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves determining which character ('A' or 'B') appears more frequently in a string of length 5.
   - There are multiple test cases, each with its own string of 'A's and 'B's.
   - For each test case, the program should output the character that appears most frequently.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It initializes counters `ac` and `bc` to count occurrences of 'A' and 'B', respectively.
   - It iterates over each character in the string and increments the appropriate counter.
   - After counting, it compares the counts and prints the character that appears more frequently.

3. **Checking for Edge Cases:**
   - If the string has an equal number of 'A's and 'B's, the program will print the last character counted, which is correct since the problem does not specify handling ties explicitly.
   - The program handles all possible inputs as per the constraints given (strings of length 5 containing only 'A' and 'B').

4. **Verification:**
   - The example provided in the problem statement is correctly handled by the program.
   - The logic for counting and comparing frequencies is straightforward and correct.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
