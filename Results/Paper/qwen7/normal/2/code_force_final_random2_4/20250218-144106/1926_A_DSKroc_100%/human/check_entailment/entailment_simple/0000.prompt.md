Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

# Annotated Program:
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, and for each test case, the input string is a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        
        bc = 0
        
        s = input()
        
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
        
    #State: Output State: The variable `t` retains its initial value as an integer between 1 and 32 inclusive. After all iterations of the loop, `q` will be equal to `t - 1`. For each iteration of the loop, `ac` and `bc` are updated based on the counts of 'A' and 'B' characters in the string `s` provided during that iteration. The final output of the loop will consist of `t` lines, each line containing either 'A' or 'B', depending on whether the count of 'A' characters was greater than the count of 'B' characters in the respective string `s`. The variable `s` is not relevant to the final output state since it is redefined as an empty string at the start of each iteration.
    #
    #In summary, after all iterations of the loop, the output will be a series of 'A' or 'B' characters, one per line, corresponding to the result of comparing the counts of 'A' and 'B' in each of the `t` strings processed.
