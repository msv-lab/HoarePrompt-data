Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, the first character of `s` is 'A', `i` is the character 'A', `ac` is 1**.

Explanation: The variable `ac` is incremented by 1. Since `ac` was initially not specified, we assume it started at 0 (as it is a common initialization). After executing `ac += 1`, `ac` becomes 1. The other variables (`s` and `i`) remain unchanged.
