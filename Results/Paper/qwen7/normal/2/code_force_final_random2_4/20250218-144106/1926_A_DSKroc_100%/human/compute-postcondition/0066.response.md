Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in s:`. This means the loop variable is `i`, and the sequence being iterated over is `s`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop variables**:
   - `i`: This is the loop variable, and it will take on each character from the string `s` during each iteration.
   - `s`: This is the string that the loop will iterate over.

3. **Initial state of other variables**:
   - `t`: An integer between 1 and 32 inclusive.
   - `q`: 2.
   - `ac`: 0.
   - `bc`: 0.
   - `s`: Equal to the input string.

4. **Conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as there are characters left in the string `s`.
   - Therefore, the loop will start when `s` is non-empty.

5. **Adjusting the states**:
   - Since the loop will start iterating over the string `s`, `s` must be a non-empty string.
   - The value of `i` will change during each iteration but will start as the first character of `s`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `s` must be a non-empty string.
- `i` will be the first character of `s`.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `i` is the first character of `s`**.
