The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by positive integers \(t\), \(n\), and \(k\), and a graph represented by adjacency lists. For each test case, it determines the minimum value \(L\) such that cutting the graph at certain edges results in at least \(k\) connected components, with each component having at most \(L\) vertices. The function then prints the value of \(L\) for each test case.
