Postcondition: **`L` is 50001, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is greater than k, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is `dfs(1, 1)`, or `L` is 1, `R` is 50001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is `dfs(1, 1)`**.

This means that after the execution of the if-else block, either:
- `L` is 50001, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is greater than `k`, `x` is 50001, and `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, or
- `L` is 1, `R` is 50001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001, and `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`.
