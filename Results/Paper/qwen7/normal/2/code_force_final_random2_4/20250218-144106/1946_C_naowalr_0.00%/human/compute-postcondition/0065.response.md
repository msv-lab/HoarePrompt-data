Output State: `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is an integer from user input; `b` is an integer from user input; for every node `i` from 1 to `n`, `adj[i]` contains a list of all nodes directly connected to node `i`; `i` is `n - 1`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `n` will still be greater than 1 (as the condition for entering the loop is `n > 1`). The variables `a` and `b` will hold the last pair of integers inputted by the user. The adjacency list `adj` will be fully constructed such that for each node `i` from 1 to `n`, the list `adj[i]` will contain all nodes that are directly connected to node `i`. The loop variable `i` will have reached its final value of `n - 1`.
