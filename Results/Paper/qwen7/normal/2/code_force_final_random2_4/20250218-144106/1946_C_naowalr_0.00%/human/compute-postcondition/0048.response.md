Output State: `numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, `L` is a value between 1 and `R` (inclusive), where `R` is 100001, and `x` is the final value of `(L + R) // 2` after the loop terminates.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `L` will be adjusted such that it is always less than or equal to `R`, and the value of `x` will be the midpoint of the current range `[L, R]`. The variable `numCuts` and `leftover` will retain their values from the last iteration of the loop, as they are not reassigned within the loop body. Since the loop condition `R - L > 1` eventually becomes false, indicating that `L` and `R` are as close as possible given the precision of integer division, `R` will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `L`.
