Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `leftover` is the result of `dfs(1, 1)` again, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`**.

Explanation: The line `leftover = dfs(1, 1)` simply reassigns the value of `leftover` to be the result of the function call `dfs(1, 1)`. Since the initial value of `leftover` was already the result of `dfs(1, 1)`, reassigning it does not change its value. The other variables (`numCuts` and `x`) remain unchanged.
