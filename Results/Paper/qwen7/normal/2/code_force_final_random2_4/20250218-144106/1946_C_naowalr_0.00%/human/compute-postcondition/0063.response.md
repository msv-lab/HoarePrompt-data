Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `a` is an integer from user input; `b` is an integer from user input; `adj[b]` contains `a` appended to it; `i` is `n - 1`**.

Explanation: The code `adj[a].append(b)` appends the value of `b` to the list `adj[b]`. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. The precondition that `adj[b]` contains `a` appended to it is updated to reflect the new appended value of `b`.
