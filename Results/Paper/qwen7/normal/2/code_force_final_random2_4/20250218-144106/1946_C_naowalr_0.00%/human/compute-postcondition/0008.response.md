Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is an integer equal to the first number inputted.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a` is the first number from the second input.
   - `b` is the second number from the second input.
   - `adj[a]` now contains `[b, b]`.
   - `adj[b]` now contains `[a]`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range `n - 1`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i < n - 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 1 (since `n - 1` is the upper limit of the range).
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
   - Since `n` is unchanged, it remains the same as the initial value.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `n` remains the same as the initial value.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:

**State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first number inputted, `i` is 1, `a` is the first number from the second input, `b` is the second number from the second input, `adj[a]` now contains `[b, b]`, `adj[b]` now contains `[a]`**
