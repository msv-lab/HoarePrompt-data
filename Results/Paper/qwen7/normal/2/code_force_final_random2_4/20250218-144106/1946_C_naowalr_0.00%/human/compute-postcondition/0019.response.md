Output State: **`n` remains an integer equal to the first number inputted, `i` is now `n-2`, `a` is the first number from the second input, `b` is the second number from the second input, `adj[a]` contains a list of all nodes connected to node `a`, and `adj[b]` contains a list of all nodes connected to node `b`; `L` is 1; `R` is 100001.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `100000.0 + 1` to the variable `R` and converts it to an integer. Since `100000.0 + 1` evaluates to `100001.0`, converting it to an integer results in `100001`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
