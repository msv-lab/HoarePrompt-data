Output State: The variable `n` remains an integer equal to the first number inputted, `i` is now `n-2`, `a` is the first number from the second input, `b` is the second number from the second input, `adj[a]` contains a list of all nodes connected to node `a`, and `adj[b]` contains a list of all nodes connected to node `b`.

In more detail, after the loop executes all its iterations (i.e., `n-1` times), the adjacency list `adj` will be fully populated based on the inputs provided. Specifically, `adj[a]` will contain a list of all nodes that are directly connected to node `a` (including `b` and potentially other nodes depending on the inputs), and similarly, `adj[b]` will contain a list of all nodes that are directly connected to node `b` (including `a` and potentially other nodes). The variable `i` will be set to `n-2` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-2`, inclusive.
