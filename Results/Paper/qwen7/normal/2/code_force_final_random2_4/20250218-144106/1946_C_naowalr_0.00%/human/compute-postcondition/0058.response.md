Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `a` is the first integer from user input; `b` is the second integer from user input; `adj[b]` now contains `a`; `i` is `n - 2`; two integers `a` and `b` are assigned the values from user input using `map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())`**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `adj[b]`, `i`, `a`, and `b` have been updated. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 1 and the structure of `adj[b]` containing `a` remain unchanged. The variable `i` is recalculated as `n - 2`. The values of `a` and `b` are now specifically set to the integers provided by the user input.
