Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `L` is either 25001 or 50001, `R` is either 50002 or 25001, `x` is 25001, `leftover` is `dfs(1, 1)`, `x` is now (L + R) // 2.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` to `(L + R) // 2`. Given the initial conditions, `L` can be either 25001 or 50001, and `R` can be either 50002 or 25001. Therefore, `x` will be calculated as follows:

- If `L` is 25001 and `R` is 50002, then `x` is `(25001 + 50002) // 2 = 75003 // 2 = 37501`.
- If `L` is 25001 and `R` is 25001, then `x` is `(25001 + 25001) // 2 = 50002 // 2 = 25001`.
- If `L` is 50001 and `R` is 50002, then `x` is `(50001 + 50002) // 2 = 100003 // 2 = 50001`.
- If `L` is 50001 and `R` is 25001, then `x` is `(50001 + 25001) // 2 = 75002 // 2 = 37500`.

However, since the initial value of `x` is given as 25001, and the only way to keep `x` as 25001 after the operation is if `L` and `R` are both 25001, the output state remains consistent with the initial state except for the updated value of `x`. Therefore, the output state is as described above.
