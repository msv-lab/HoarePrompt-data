Output State: **`numCuts` is 0, `R` is 100001, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is an integer from user input, `b` is an integer from user input, for every node `i` (where `1 ≤ i ≤ n`), `adj[i]` contains a list of all nodes directly connected to node `i`, `i` is `n - 1`, `L` is 1.**

Explanation: The line `numCuts = 0` initializes the variable `numCuts` to 0. No other changes are made to the initial state, so all other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
