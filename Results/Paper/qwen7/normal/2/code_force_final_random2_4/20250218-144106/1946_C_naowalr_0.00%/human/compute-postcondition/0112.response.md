Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first number inputted, `b` is an integer equal to the second number inputted, `adj[b]` now contains `a` and includes the appended value `a`, `i` is incremented by 1 and is less than `n - 1`, two integers `a` and `b` are assigned the values from the input split into a list and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the standard input, splits them into a list, and then converts each element of the list to an integer, assigning them to `a` and `b`. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
