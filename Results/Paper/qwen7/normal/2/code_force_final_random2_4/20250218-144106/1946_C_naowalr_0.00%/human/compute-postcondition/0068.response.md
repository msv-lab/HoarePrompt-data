Output State: **`R` is 100001, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is an integer from user input, `b` is an integer from user input, for every node `i` (where `1 ≤ i ≤ n`), `adj[i]` contains a list of all nodes directly connected to node `i`, `i` is `n - 1`, `L` is 1.**

Explanation: The line `R = int(100000.0 + 1)` assigns the value 100001 to the variable `R`. All other variables retain their initial conditions.
