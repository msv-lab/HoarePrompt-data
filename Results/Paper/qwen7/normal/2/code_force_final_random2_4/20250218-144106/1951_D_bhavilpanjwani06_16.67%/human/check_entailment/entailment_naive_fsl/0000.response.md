Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider scenarios where the number of stalls needed is more than 2 but less than or equal to 60. Hereâ€™s an example where the program does not work as expected:

Consider the following input:
```
255 8
```

According to the problem description, we need to find a way to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly 8 jewels. The program only considers two specific cases:
1. When `n < k`, it prints "NO".
2. When `n == k`, it prints "YES" and sets up 1 stall with the price equal to `n`.
3. When `k - 1 < n - k + 1`, it prints "YES" and sets up 2 stalls with prices `n - k + 1` and `1`.

However, for the input `255 8`, the program incorrectly prints "NO" because it does not check if setting up more than 2 stalls could achieve the goal. For instance, setting up 8 stalls with prices `32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, 1, 1` would allow Alice to buy exactly 8 jewels, but the program does not consider this scenario.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not cover all necessary cases.
