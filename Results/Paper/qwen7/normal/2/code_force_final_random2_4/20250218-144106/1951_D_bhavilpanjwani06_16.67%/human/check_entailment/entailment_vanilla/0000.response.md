### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Basic Cases**:
   - If `n < k`, Alice cannot buy `k` jewels, so the output is "NO".
   - If `n == k`, Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels if the price per jewel is `1`. So, the output is "YES" and the number of stalls is `1`.
3. **Intermediate Case**:
   - If `k - 1 < n - k + 1`, it means Alice can buy `k-1` jewels from the first stall and then use the remaining coins to buy `1` jewel from another stall. The program correctly handles this case by setting the prices of the stalls accordingly.
4. **General Case**:
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it implies that it is impossible to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. However, the current implementation incorrectly prints "NO" without attempting to set up more than 2 stalls.

### Analysis:
- The program fails to handle cases where more than 2 stalls are needed to achieve the goal. For example, if `k` is significantly larger than `n`, the program should attempt to distribute the purchases across more stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
- The logic for handling the general case needs to be expanded to include scenarios where more than 2 stalls might be necessary.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible scenarios where more than 2 stalls are required to achieve the goal of making Alice buy exactly `k` jewels.

### Correctness:
**False**
