Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem but does not fully address the requirements. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Test Case Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using `for _ in range(int(input()))` to process each test case.
2. **Condition Checking**:
   - It checks if `n < k` and prints 'NO' if true.
   - It checks if `n == k` and prints 'YES', 1, and `n` if true.
   - It checks if `k - 1 < n - k + 1` and prints 'YES', 2, `n - k + 1`, and 1 if true.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

However, the logic for determining if Bob can set up stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels is flawed:
- The condition `k - 1 < n - k + 1` is not sufficient to guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels. This condition only checks a specific scenario and does not cover all possible ways to achieve the goal.
- The program does not provide a general solution to set up the stalls with prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. It only checks a few specific conditions and does not handle the general case where more than 2 stalls might be needed.

Given the problem statement, the program should be able to handle any number of stalls up to 60 and set appropriate prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The current implementation does not meet these requirements.

Correctness: **False**
