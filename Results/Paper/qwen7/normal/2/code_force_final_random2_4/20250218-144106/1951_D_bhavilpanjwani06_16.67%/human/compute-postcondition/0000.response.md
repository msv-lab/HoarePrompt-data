Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, n is an input integer, k is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to variables `n` and `k`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still holds an integer value within the range 1 to 1000.
