Postcondition: `num` is 0, `no` is a list containing `a`, `less` is a list containing `a` or is empty, `big` is a list containing `a` or is empty, `no` remains empty, `iterable2` is `innerLoop`, `x` is the integer value of the first input, `a` is the integer value of the second input.

Explanation: In both the if and else parts, the value of `num` remains 0, `no` becomes a list containing `a`, and `less` and `big` can either contain `a` or remain empty. The `iterable2` remains as `innerLoop`, and `x` and `a` retain their original values as the integer values of the first and second inputs respectively.
