The function processes a series of constraints defined across multiple test cases. For each test case, it categorizes integers into three lists based on their type (big, less, or no) and calculates the difference between the smallest integer in the 'less' list and the largest integer in the 'big' list, adjusted for any integers in the 'no' list that fall within the range of the 'big' and 'less' lists. If the resulting count is positive, it is printed; otherwise, 0 is printed.
