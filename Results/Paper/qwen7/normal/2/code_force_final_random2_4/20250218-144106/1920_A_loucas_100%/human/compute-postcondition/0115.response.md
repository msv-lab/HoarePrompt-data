Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in no:`. The key variables here are `i` and `no`.

2. **Understand the postcondition**: The postcondition given is that `i` is an integer, and `num` is the value of its original value minus 1. Additionally, this holds true if `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`.

3. **Determine the changes needed**: Since the loop is iterating over `no`, the variable `i` will change with each iteration. The postcondition tells us that `i` is reduced by 1 after each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i - 1`.

4. **Consider the constraints**: The loop continues as long as `i` is within the range defined by `less` and `big`. However, since the exact values of `less` and `big` are not provided, we cannot directly update these lists. We only need to ensure that `i` is still within the valid range for the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the state**: Given that `i` is reduced by 1 at the end of each iteration, we need to set `i` to `i - 1` for the next iteration. The other variables (`num`, `less`, and `big`) remain unchanged unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Based on the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is the original value of `i` minus 1, `num` is the original value of `num` minus 1, `less` and `big` remain the same**.

However, since the exact initial values of `i` and `num` are not provided, we can only express the updated value of `i` and `num` in terms of their previous values.

Final Answer:
State: **`i` is the original value of `i` minus 1, `num` is the original value of `num` minus 1, `less` and `big` remain the same**.
