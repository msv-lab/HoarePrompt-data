Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `no`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `no`.

3. **Determine the postconditions**:
   - `no` is a list containing at least one value of `a` that was neither 1 nor 2.
   - `num` is decremented by 1.
   - If the condition `i <= min(less) and i >= max(big)` is true, then `num` is further decremented by 1.

4. **Analyze the loop execution**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `no` contains at least one value of `a` that was neither 1 nor 2.
   - `num` has been decremented by 1.
   - If the condition `i <= min(less) and i >= max(big)` was true for the current `i`, then `num` would have been further decremented by 1.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `no`, the variable `i` will take the next value from the list `no`.
   - The list `no` will lose the current value of `i` because it has been processed.
   - `num` will be decremented by 1 regardless of the condition being true or false.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- `no` will lose the current value of `i` (let's call it `i_current`).
- `num` will be decremented by 1.

Therefore, the updated states for the next iteration are:

**State: **`no` is a list containing at least one value of `a` that was neither 1 nor 2 (excluding `i_current`), and `num` is decremented by 1.**
