Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `loop` is an input integer
Code of the loop:
for iterable in range(loop):
    less = []
    big = []
    no = []
    num = 0
    innerLoop = int(input())
    for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
        x, a = map(int, input().split())
        if x == 1:
            big.append(a)
        elif x == 2:
            less.append(a)
        else:
            no.append(a)
    num = min(less) - max(big) + 1
    if num < 1:
        print(0)
        continue
    for i in no:
        if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):
            num -= 1
    print(num)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `num` will be decremented for each element in `no` that satisfies the condition `i <= min(less) and i >= max(big)`. The lists `big`, `less`, and `no` will retain their final states as they were after the last iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `num` is equal to the original value of `num` minus the total number of iterations executed, `less` contains all integers `a` where `x` was 2 during the loop iterations, `big` contains all integers `a` where `x` was 1 during the loop iterations, `no` remains empty (since every element in `no` has been processed), `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop`, `x` is the last value read from the loop and it is not 1 or 2, `a` is the last value read from the loop and it is not in `less` or `big`, and the current value of `num` is either less than or equal to 0, or `num` is exactly 0 and `x` is not 1 or 2 and `a` is not in `less` or `big`.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `num` will be reduced by the total number of elements that satisfied the condition `i <= min(less) and i >= max(big)` in the set `no`. The sets `less` and `big` remain unchanged as no elements are added or removed from them within the loop. The set `no` becomes empty since all its elements have been processed. The variables `iterable2`, `x`, and `a` retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The list `no` is empty, and `num` is less than or equal to its initial value minus the number of times the loop executed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
