Output State: **`less` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer.**

The code reads two integers from the input using `map(int, input().split())` and assigns them to `x` and `a`. The values of `less`, `num`, `big`, and `no` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
