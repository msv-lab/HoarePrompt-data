Output State: **`less` is a list, `num` is an integer, `big` is a list, `no` is a list, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to `x` and `a` respectively using the `map` function combined with `int`. The `input().split()` function reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings, which `map(int, ...)` then converts to integers. The values of the other variables (`less`, `num`, `big`, `no`, and `iterable2`) remain unchanged.
