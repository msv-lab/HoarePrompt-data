You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. There are n lines describing the constraints, where each line contains two integers a and x such that a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. Additionally, there is at least one constraint of type 1, at least one constraint of type 2, and all pairs (a, x) are distinct.
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for iterable in range(loop):
        less = []
        
        big = []
        
        no = []
        
        num = 0
        
        innerLoop = int(input())
        
        for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
            x, a = map(int, input().split())
            if x == 1:
                big.append(a)
            elif x == 2:
                less.append(a)
            else:
                no.append(a)
        
        num = min(less) - max(big) + 1
        
        if num < 1:
            print(0)
            continue
        
        for i in no:
            if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):
                num -= 1
        
        print(num)
        
    #State: Output State: All elements in the list `no` have been processed, and `num` is equal to the initial value of `num` minus the total number of elements that satisfied the condition `i <= min(less) and i >= max(big)` across all iterations of the loop. The lists `big` and `less` contain all integers `a` where `x` was 1 or 2 during the loop iterations, respectively, and the list `no` is now empty. The variable `iterable2` retains its final value from the last iteration of the loop, and `x` and `a` hold the last values read from the loop, which are not 1 or 2 and not in `less` or `big`, respectively. If `num` is less than or equal to 0 after processing all elements in `no`, it will be printed as 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of constraints defined within its scope. It returns a specific value or set of values based on the given constraints, which include an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases, an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) for each test case, and n lines of constraints where each line contains two integers a and x (a ∈ {1, 2, 3}, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9). The function ensures there is at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, and all pairs (a, x) are distinct.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
