Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the list `no`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `no`. For each iteration, if `i` is a value that is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`, then `num` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, no changes occur to the list `no` and the value of `num` remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the postcondition for the next iteration**: We need to ensure that the loop can execute again. This means that `i` (the current element being processed) should not satisfy the condition to decrease `num`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is taken from the list `no`, it will be removed from `no` after the first iteration. Therefore, for the next iteration, `no` must contain at least one value of `a` that was neither 1 nor 2, and `i` must not be a value that decreases `num`.
   - `num` remains unchanged as long as `i` does not satisfy the condition to decrease `num`.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `no` must still contain at least one value of `a` that was neither 1 nor 2.
- `i` must not be a value that is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `no` is a list containing at least one value of `a` that was neither 1 nor 2, and `i` is a value that does not satisfy the condition to decrease `num`.**
