You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

The lists `big` and `less` contain all integers `a` where `x` was 1 or 2 during the loop iterations, respectively, and the list `no` is now empty. The variable `iterable2` retains its final value from the last iteration of the loop, and `x` and `a` hold the last values read from the loop, which are not 1 or 2 and not in `less` or `big`, respectively. If `num` is less than or equal to 0 after processing all elements in `no`, it will be printed as 0.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the `no` list contains values that overlap with the range between the minimum of `less` and the maximum of `big`. Specifically, the program subtracts 1 from `num` for each value in `no` that lies within the range `[max(big), min(less)]`, but this logic does not account for the possibility that a value in `no` could be exactly equal to `min(less)` or `max(big)`, which would still disqualify it from being a valid `k`.

For example, consider the following input:
- Test case with `n = 4`
- Constraints: 
  1. `k >= 3`
  2. `k <= 10`
  3. `k != 3`
  4. `k != 10`

The program will calculate the range `[3, 10]` and then check for values in `no` which are `3` and `10`. However, since both `3` and `10` are excluded, the program should not subtract 1 from `num` for these values. Instead, it should only subtract 1 for values that lie strictly within the range, which in this case is none.

The correct approach would be to exclude the values in `no` that are exactly `min(less)` or `max(big)` before subtracting from `num`. Here is a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for iterable in range(loop):
        less = []
        big = []
        no = []
        num = 0
        innerLoop = int(input())
        for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
            (x, a) = map(int, input().split())
            if x == 1:
                big.append(a)
            elif x == 2:
                less.append(a)
            else:
                no.append(a)
        num = min(less) - max(big) - 1
        if num < 0:
            print(0)
            continue
        for i in no:
            if i > max(big) and i < min(less):
                num -= 1
        print(num)
```

This corrected version ensures that values in `no` that are exactly `min(less)` or `max(big)` are not counted as reducing the valid range of `k`.
