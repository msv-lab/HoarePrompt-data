Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - The list `no` is empty.
   - `num` is less than or equal to its initial value minus the number of times the loop executed.

2. **Understanding the Code**:
   - The code snippet only contains a single `print(num)` statement.
   - There is no loop or any other operation that modifies `num` after it is initialized.

3. **Determining `num`**:
   - Since `no` is an empty list, there is no additional context about `num` from the list itself.
   - The only information given is that `num` is less than or equal to its initial value minus the number of times the loop executed. However, since there is no loop mentioned in the code, the number of times the loop executed is 0.
   - Therefore, `num` must be equal to its initial value because `num` is less than or equal to its initial value minus 0 (which is just its initial value).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The `print(num)` statement will simply print the value of `num`, which is its initial value.

Output: **num (where num is its initial value)**
