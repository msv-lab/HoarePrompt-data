Output State: **`no` is a list containing `a`, `innerLoop` is at least 1, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, and `x` is not equal to 2.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a` to the list `no`. The other variables remain unchanged. `no` is now a list containing the value of `a`, while the conditions for `innerLoop`, `iterable2`, `x`, and `a` remain the same as the initial state.
