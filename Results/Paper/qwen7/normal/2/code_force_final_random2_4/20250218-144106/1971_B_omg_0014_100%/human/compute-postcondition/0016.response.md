Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `a` is a set containing unique characters from `s`. If the size of the set `a` is 1, then `b` is a string that is equal to the sorted version of `s`, and `c` is a string that contains the characters of `s` sorted in descending order. Otherwise, the length of `a` is not equal to 1; `b` is a string that is either equal to the sorted version of `s` or not equal to it, and `c` is a string that contains the characters of `s` sorted in descending order.
