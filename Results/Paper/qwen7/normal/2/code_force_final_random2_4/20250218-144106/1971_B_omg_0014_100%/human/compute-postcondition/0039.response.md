Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a set containing the unique characters of `s`, `b` is the sorted version of `s`, and `c` is a string containing the characters of `s` sorted in descending order. Regardless of whether the condition `len(a) == 1` is true or false, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.**
