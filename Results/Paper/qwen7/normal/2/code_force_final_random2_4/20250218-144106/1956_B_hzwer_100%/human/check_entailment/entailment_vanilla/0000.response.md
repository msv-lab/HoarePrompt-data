Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` from standard input.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the list of integers `a` representing the cards in your hand.

2. **Counting Card Occurrences:**
   - The program initializes a count array `cnt` of size `n + 1` to keep track of how many times each integer from 1 to n appears in the list `a`.
   - It iterates over the list `a` and increments the corresponding index in `cnt` for each integer.

3. **Calculating Maximum Points:**
   - The program then calculates the maximum points you can get by iterating over the count array `cnt`.
   - For each count `x` in `cnt`, it adds `max(0, x - 1)` to the answer `ans`. This means if a number appears `x` times in your hand, you can get up to `x - 1` points by placing those cards on the table when Nene already has a card with the same number on the table.

4. **Outputting the Result:**
   - Finally, the program prints the calculated answer `ans` for each test case.

### Correctness Analysis

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the program:

- The program correctly counts the occurrences of each integer in your hand.
- The logic for calculating the maximum points you can get is sound. Since Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score while minimizing yours, you can only get points if you place a card on the table when Nene already has a card with the same number. Placing a card when Nene doesn't have one won't give you any points.
- The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem statement.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
