Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt` after decrementing each element (except the first one) by one, `cnt` is a list where each element (except for the element at index 0) is equal to the number of times the corresponding integer appeared in the list `a`, decremented by one, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user, converts each integer to an integer type using `map(int, ...)` and then collects them into a list `a`. This changes the value of `a` but does not affect the values of `n` or `ans`, nor does it change the description of `cnt`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated list `a` and retains the descriptions of `n`, `ans`, and `cnt`.
