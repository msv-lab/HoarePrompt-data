Output State: `cnt` is [1, 2, 0], `ans` is 8, `a` is a list of integers that contains exactly two integers.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment the count of the integer `x` found in the list `a`. After the loop has executed all its iterations, it means all elements in the list `a` have been processed. Since the output state after 3 iterations indicates that the list `a` must contain at least two integers, and no new integers were added or conditions changed in the loop, we can conclude that the list `a` contains exactly two integers. Therefore, the counts in `cnt` will reflect the occurrences of these two integers, and `ans` remains unchanged at 8.
