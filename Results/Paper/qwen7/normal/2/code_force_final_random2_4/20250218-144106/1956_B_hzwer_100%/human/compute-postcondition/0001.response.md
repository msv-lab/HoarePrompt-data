Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved here is `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` is a positive integer.
   - Since `t` is defined as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `int(input())` should be within this range to ensure the loop can execute.
   - The initial value of `t` is irrelevant because the loop condition is based on the input from `input()`.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - We need to ensure that the input from `input()` is a valid integer within the specified range for the loop to execute.

Given the above points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- The input from `input()` must be a valid integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Therefore, the final state after adjustment is:

**State: `input` must be a valid integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
