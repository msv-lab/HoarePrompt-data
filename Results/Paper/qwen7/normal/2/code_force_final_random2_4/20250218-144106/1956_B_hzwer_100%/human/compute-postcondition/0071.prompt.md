Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; the list `a` contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and each integer from 1 through n appears in the list at most 2 times; `input` is set to `sys.stdin.readline`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = [0] * (n + 1)
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] += 1
    ans = 0
    for x in cnt:
        ans += max(0, x - 1)
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`, `cnt` is a list where each element (except for the element at index 0) is equal to the number of times the corresponding integer appeared in the list `a`.

In simpler terms, `ans` will be the total count of how many times each number in the list `a` appeared, minus one, summed up for all numbers in `cnt`. The list `cnt` will have been updated such that each element (except the first one) represents the count of its respective integer in `a`, with each count decremented by one after each iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: The final value of `ans` will be the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt` after decrementing each element (except the first one) by one, for all iterations of the loop. The variable `cnt` will be modified such that each element is decremented by one, except the first element, and any non-positive elements will be removed from `cnt`.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `ans` will be the sum of the positive decremented values of all elements in `cnt` (excluding the first element), and `cnt` will contain only the positive decremented values of its original elements.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `cnt` is [2], `ans` is 3.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute until `cnt` is no longer a list with more than one element. Given the initial state and the operations within the loop, we can see that the loop reduces the elements in `cnt` by 1 each iteration. After the third iteration, `cnt` becomes [2]. The loop will continue to run as long as `cnt` has more than one element. Since `[2]` has only one element, it does not meet the condition to enter the loop again. Therefore, the loop stops here. The value of `ans` increases by 1 for each iteration, so after 3 iterations, `ans` is 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
