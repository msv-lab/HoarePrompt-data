Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `x`, which iterates over the list `cnt`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `x`**: Since `x` is iterating over the list `cnt`, the initial value of `x` will be the first element of `cnt`.

3. **Determine the Length of `cnt`**: For the loop to execute, `cnt` must have at least one element. If `cnt` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Initial Value of `ans`**: The variable `ans` is given as 0, but this does not affect the loop's execution directly since `ans` is not used within the loop head.

5. **List `cnt`**: The list `cnt` will contain the count of each integer from the list `a`. This means `cnt` must be initialized with the correct counts before the loop starts.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `cnt` has at least one element for the loop to execute. Therefore, the state of `cnt` must be such that it has at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans` is 0, `cnt` must have at least one element**
