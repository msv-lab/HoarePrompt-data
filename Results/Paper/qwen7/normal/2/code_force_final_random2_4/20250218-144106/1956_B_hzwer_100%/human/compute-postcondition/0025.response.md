To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the calculation of `ans`.

1. **Initial State Description:**
   - `cnt` is a list where each element (except for the element at index 0) is equal to the number of times the corresponding integer appeared in the list `a`.
   - `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`.

2. **Understanding `cnt`:**
   - Let's assume the list `a` contains integers. For each unique integer in `a`, `cnt` will have an element representing how many times that integer appears in `a`, except the first element of `cnt` (index 0) which is not relevant here since it's not derived from counting occurrences in `a`.

3. **Calculating `ans`:**
   - For each element `x` in `cnt` (starting from index 1), `max(0, x - 1)` calculates the maximum of 0 and `x - 1`.
   - This means if `x` is 0 or 1, `max(0, x - 1)` will be 0. If `x` is greater than 1, `max(0, x - 1)` will be `x - 1`.
   - Summing these values gives us `ans`.

Given this understanding, let's consider a concrete example to illustrate:

- Suppose `a = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3]`.
- Then `cnt` would be `[0, 2, 2, 1]` because:
  - 1 appears 2 times.
  - 2 appears 3 times.
  - 3 appears 1 time.

Now, calculating `ans`:
- `max(0, cnt[1] - 1) = max(0, 2 - 1) = 1`
- `max(0, cnt[2] - 1) = max(0, 2 - 1) = 1`
- `max(0, cnt[3] - 1) = max(0, 1 - 1) = 0`

Summing these values: `1 + 1 + 0 = 2`.

Therefore, `ans` is 2.

Output: **2**
