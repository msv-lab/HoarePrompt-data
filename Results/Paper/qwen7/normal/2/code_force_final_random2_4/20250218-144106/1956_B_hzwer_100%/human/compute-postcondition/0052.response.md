Output State: **`cnt` is `[0, 0, 0]`, `ans` is `8`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code initializes `cnt` to a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`. Since `n` is not specified, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `cnt` is now a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`. The values of `ans` and `a` remain unchanged.
