Output State: **`cnt` is [2], `ans` is 3**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by adding `max(0, x - 1)` to it. Given that `x` is not defined in the initial state, we assume `x` to be a variable that could be any value. However, since no specific value for `x` is provided, we consider the general case where `x` is 1 (as the initial value of `ans` is 2, and `max(0, x - 1)` would be 0 if `x` were less than or equal to 1, and 1 if `x` were greater than 1). In this context, `max(0, x - 1)` evaluates to 1 when `x` is 2 or more, thus `ans` becomes 3. The list `cnt` remains unchanged.
