Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for tc in range(t)`. The variables involved here are `tc` and `t`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `tc`**: The variable `tc` (which stands for "test case") is initialized to 0 when the loop starts because `range(t)` generates numbers from 0 to `t-1`.

3. **Determine the Value of `t`**: The value of `t` is given as `int(input())`, and it is specified that `1 <= t <= 1000`.

4. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**: For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. If `t` were 0, the loop would not execute at all.

5. **Adjust the States**: Based on the above points, we need to ensure that `t` is set to a valid positive integer within the range [1, 1000], and `tc` should be initialized to 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `t` and `tc`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `tc` is 0**
