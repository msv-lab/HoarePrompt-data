Output State: **`j` is 1, `i` is not equal to `j`, and `ans` is a list containing the values [1, 2]**.

Explanation: The code `ans.append(1 << j)` appends the value of `1 << j` (which is `1 << 1` or `2`) to the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` contains the value `1`. After appending `2`, `ans` becomes `[1, 2]`. The values of `j` and `i` remain unchanged.
