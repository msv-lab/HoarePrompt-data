Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(20)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j`.

2. **Determine the current state of `j`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than 20. Since `j` is currently 1, it is less than 20, so the loop can execute again.

4. **Update the state of `j`**: For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 2.

5. **Check if other variables need adjustment**: The variables `i` and `ans` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

6. **Formulate the new state**: The only variable that needs to be updated is `j`, which will be 2. The postconditions for `i` and `ans` remain the same since they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`j` is 2, `i` is not equal to `j`, and `ans` is a list containing the values [1, 2]**
