Output State: **`i` is the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `tc` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is a list containing `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]**.

Explanation: The variable `i` was set to the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`. The other variables `t`, `tc`, and `n` remained unchanged. The list `ans` is now defined as `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`, where `(1 << i)` represents \(2^i\).
