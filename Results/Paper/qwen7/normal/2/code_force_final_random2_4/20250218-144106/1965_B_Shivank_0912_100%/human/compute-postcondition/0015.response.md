Output State: **`j` is 0, `i` is not equal to `j`, `ans` is a list containing the value 1.**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(1 << j)` appends the value of `1 << j` to the list `ans`. Given that `j` is initially 0, `1 << j` equals `1 << 0`, which is 1. Therefore, `ans` now contains the value 1. The condition that `j` is not equal to `i` remains unchanged.
