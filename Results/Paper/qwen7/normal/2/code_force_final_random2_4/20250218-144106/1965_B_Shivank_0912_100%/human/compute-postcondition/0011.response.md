Output State: `i` is the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `tc` is 0, `n` is an input integer.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` as long as \(1 << i + 1 \leq k\). This means `i` will keep increasing until \(2^{i+1}\) exceeds `k`. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will be the highest integer such that \(2^i \leq k\). The other variables (`t`, `tc`, and `n`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
