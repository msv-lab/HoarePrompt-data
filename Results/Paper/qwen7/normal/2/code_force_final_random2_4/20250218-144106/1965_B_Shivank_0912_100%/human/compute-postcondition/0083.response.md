Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is explicitly given as 19.
- `ans` is a list containing the values from 1 to 20, but only if `i` is not equal to `j`. Since `i` is not mentioned and the condition `i != j` is true (as `i` is not specified and `j` is 19), the list `ans` will contain the values from 1 to 20.

Therefore, the length of the list `ans` will be 20.

Output: **20**
