Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(20)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j`.

2. **Determine the current state of `j`**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition states that `j` is 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than 20. Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `j` will be 1.

4. **Adjust the state**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be 1. The other variables (`i` and `ans`) are not part of the loop head and therefore their states do not need to be adjusted.

Based on the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`j` is 1, `i` is not equal to `j`, and `ans` is a list containing the value 1**
