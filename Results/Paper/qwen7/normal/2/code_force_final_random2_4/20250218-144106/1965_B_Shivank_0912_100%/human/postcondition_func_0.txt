The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers: t (the number of test cases), n (the size of the set), and k (an integer within the set). For each test case, it calculates a list of integers and prints the length of this list followed by the list itself. The list contains all integers from 1 to 20, excluding the integer at index `i`, where `i` is determined based on the value of `k`.
