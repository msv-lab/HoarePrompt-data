Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
2. It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n`, `m`, and the string `a`.
3. The function `func_1` is called with these parameters.
4. In `func_1`, the program initializes an array `count` of size 7 to zero. This array will store the count of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G').
5. It then iterates over the string `a`, incrementing the corresponding index in the `count` array for each character encountered.
6. After counting the existing problems, it calculates how many additional problems are needed for each difficulty level to ensure that there are at least `m` problems for each round.
7. If the count of a particular difficulty level is less than `m`, it adds the difference (`m - count[i]`) to `needed_problems`.
8. Finally, it returns the total number of additional problems needed.

Given the problem description and the steps above, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
