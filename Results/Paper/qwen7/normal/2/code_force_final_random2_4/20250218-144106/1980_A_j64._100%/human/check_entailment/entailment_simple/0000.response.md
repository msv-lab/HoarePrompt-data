Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the number of test cases, the number of problems in the bank (`n`), the number of rounds (`m`), and the difficulties of the problems in the bank (`a`).
2. The `func_1` function processes each test case appropriately:
   - It initializes a `count` array to keep track of the frequency of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') in the input string `a`.
   - It iterates through the string `a` and updates the `count` array accordingly.
   - It then calculates the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level to ensure there are at least `m` problems for each round.
   - Finally, it returns the total number of additional problems required.
3. The logic for calculating the number of additional problems needed is correct. For each difficulty level, if the current count is less than `m`, the difference `m - count[i]` is added to `needed_problems`.
4. The program handles multiple test cases as expected by using a loop to process each test case independently.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
