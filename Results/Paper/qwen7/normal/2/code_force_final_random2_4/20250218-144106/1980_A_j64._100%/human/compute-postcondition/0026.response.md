Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer between 1 and 50), `m` (an integer between 1 and 5), and `a` (a string of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'). It counts the occurrences of each character in `a` and calculates the total number of additional problems needed such that each character type in the range 'A' to 'G' appears at least `m` times. The function returns this total count.**
