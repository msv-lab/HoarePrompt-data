Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `cases`. Each tuple contains three integers `(n, m, k)` representing the lengths of two arrays `a` and `b`, and the number of elements to be chosen, respectively. The function processes each test case according to specific conditions and returns a list named `results`. For each test case, if the conditions are met, the result is `'YES'`; otherwise, it is `'NO'`. The final state of the program is that the `results` list contains either `'NO'` or `'YES'` for each test case.**
