Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter t, which is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, and a parameter cases, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains three integers (n, m, k) representing the lengths of arrays a and b, and the number of elements to be chosen, respectively. Based on certain conditions, the function returns a list named 'results' containing either 'NO' or 'YES' for each test case.**
