Output State: **`unique_b` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `b` in each tuple of `cases`; `cases` is a non-empty list, each tuple in `cases` contains valid values for `n`, `m`, and `k` as specified, and arrays `a` and `b` in each tuple are valid lists of integers within the specified range; `unique_a` is a set containing unique elements from list `a` in each tuple of `cases`; `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` where each element is less than or equal to `k`; `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` where each element is less than or equal to `k`; `only_a` is a set containing elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`; `only_b` is a set containing elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`.**

Explanation: The line `only_b = relevant_b - relevant_a` creates a new set `only_b` which contains elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`. The sets `unique_a`, `unique_b`, `relevant_a`, and `relevant_b` remain unchanged. The set `only_a` also remains unchanged.
