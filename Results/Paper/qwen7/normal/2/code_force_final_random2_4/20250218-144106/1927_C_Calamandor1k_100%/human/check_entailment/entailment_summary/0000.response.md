Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates through each test case, extracting the necessary parameters and storing them in the `cases` list.
3. The function `func_1` processes each test case as follows:
   - It creates sets of unique elements from arrays `a` and `b`.
   - It filters these sets to include only elements that are less than or equal to `k`.
   - It calculates the number of elements that are exclusive to `a` (`only_a`), exclusive to `b` (`only_b`), and common to both (`both`).
   - It checks if the number of elements exclusive to `a` or `b` exceeds `k // 2`.
   - It verifies if the total number of distinct elements across `a` and `b` is at least `k`.
4. Based on these checks, it appends `'YES'` or `'NO'` to the `results` list.
5. Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

The logic implemented in `func_1` matches the problem requirements accurately. It correctly handles the constraints and conditions specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
