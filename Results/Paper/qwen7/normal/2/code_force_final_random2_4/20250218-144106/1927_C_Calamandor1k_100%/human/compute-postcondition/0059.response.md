Output State: **`total_distinct` is equal to the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`; `results` is a list with 'NO' appended.**

Explanation: The variable `total_distinct` remains unchanged as its value is determined by the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`. The code appends the string `'NO'` to the list `results`, which means `results` now contains the element `'NO'`. No other variables are affected.
