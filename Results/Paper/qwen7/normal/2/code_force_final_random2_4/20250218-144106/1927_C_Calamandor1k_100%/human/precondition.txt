t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three integers n, m, and k, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅min(n, m), with k being even. Additionally, each test case includes two lists, a and b, where a has n integers ranging from 1 to 10^6 and b has m integers ranging from 1 to 10^6. It is guaranteed that the sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 4⋅10^5.
