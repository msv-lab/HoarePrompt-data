Output State: **`cases` is a non-empty list, each tuple in `cases` contains valid values for `n`, `m`, and `k` as specified, and arrays `a` and `b` in each tuple are valid lists of integers within the specified range; `unique_a` is a set containing unique elements from list `a` in each tuple of `cases`.**

The code `unique_a = set(a)` creates a set from the list `a` in each tuple of the `cases` list. This means that `unique_a` will contain only the unique elements from the list `a` in each tuple. The other variables and their values remain unchanged.
