### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to determine if it's possible to choose exactly \( \frac{k}{2} \) elements from each of two arrays (`a` and `b`) such that all integers from 1 to \( k \) are included among the chosen elements.

2. **Key Steps in the Code**:
   - **Input Parsing**: The code correctly parses the input to get the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it gets the lengths of arrays `a` and `b`, and the value of `k`.
   - **Set Operations**: It uses sets to store unique elements from `a` and `b` that are less than or equal to `k`. This helps in efficiently checking the presence of elements.
   - **Relevant Elements**: It identifies elements in `a` and `b` that are relevant (i.e., within the range 1 to `k`).
   - **Conditions Check**:
     - If there are more than \( \frac{k}{2} \) elements in `a` but not in `b`, or vice versa, it returns 'NO'.
     - If the total distinct elements (from `a` and `b`) are less than `k`, it returns 'NO'.
     - Otherwise, it returns 'YES'.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The code handles the constraints properly, ensuring that the sum of `n` and `m` does not exceed \( 4 \times 10^5 \).
   - The logic checks if the total distinct elements can cover all numbers from 1 to `k`.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic is sound and covers all necessary conditions.
   - The code correctly handles the edge cases where it is impossible to choose the required elements.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to choose the required elements from the arrays `a` and `b` such that all integers from 1 to `k` are included.

### Correctness:
**True**
