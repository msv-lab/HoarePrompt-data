Output State: **`total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`; `unique_a` is a set containing elements from `a`, `results` list now contains 'YES', `unique_b` is a set containing elements from `b`, cases must have at least one element.**

Explanation: The code `unique_b = set(b)` creates a set named `unique_b` which contains unique elements from the list `b`. This does not affect the values of `total_distinct`, `unique_a`, `results`, or the condition about `cases`. Therefore, those variables retain their original descriptions.
