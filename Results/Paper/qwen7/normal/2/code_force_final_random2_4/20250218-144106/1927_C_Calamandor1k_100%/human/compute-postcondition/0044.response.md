Output State: **`total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`; `unique_a` is a set containing elements from `a`, `results` list now contains 'YES', `cases` must have at least one element.**

Explanation: The line `unique_a = set(a)` creates a set from the list `a`. A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements. The values of `total_distinct`, `results`, and `cases` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new variable `unique_a` is created and assigned the set of unique elements from `a`.
