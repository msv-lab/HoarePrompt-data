Output State: **`total_distinct` is the sum of the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`; `unique_a` is a set containing elements from `a`, `results` list now contains 'NO', `unique_b` is a set containing elements from `b`, `relevant_a` is a set containing elements from `unique_a` that are less than or equal to `k`, `relevant_b` is a set containing elements from `unique_b` that are less than or equal to `k`, `only_a` is a set containing elements from `relevant_a` that are not in `relevant_b`, `only_b` is a set containing elements from `relevant_b` that are not in `relevant_a`, `both` is a set containing elements that are common in `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`.**

Explanation: The line `results.append('NO')` appends the string `'NO'` to the `results` list. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
