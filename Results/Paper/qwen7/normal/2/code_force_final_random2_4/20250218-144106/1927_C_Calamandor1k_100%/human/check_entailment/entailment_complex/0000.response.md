Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to choose exactly \(\frac{k}{2}\) elements from both arrays \(a\) and \(b\) such that every integer from 1 to \(k\) is included among the chosen elements. Here's a detailed breakdown of the correctness:

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\) and initializes a list `cases` to store the details of each test case.
   - It then iterates through each test case, parsing the values of \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\) along with the arrays \(a\) and \(b\).

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, the program creates sets `unique_a` and `unique_b` to store the unique elements of arrays \(a\) and \(b\).
   - It then creates subsets `relevant_a` and `relevant_b` containing elements from \(a\) and \(b\) that are less than or equal to \(k\).
   - The program calculates the elements that are exclusive to \(a\) (`only_a`) and those exclusive to \(b` (`only_b`), and also finds the common elements between \(a\) and \(b\) (`both`).

3. **Validation Conditions**:
   - The program checks if the number of elements exclusive to \(a\) or \(b\) exceeds \(\frac{k}{2}\). If so, it immediately appends `'NO'` to the results list.
   - It then checks if the total number of distinct elements (from both exclusive and common sets) is at least \(k\). If not, it appends `'NO'`.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it appends `'YES'` to the results list.

4. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the results for each test case based on the conditions checked.

Given the logic and the implementation, the program correctly determines whether it is possible to choose the required elements for each test case. Therefore, the provided program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
