### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotated code to understand its behavior and correctness.

#### Key Points from the Annotated Code:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input and stores the test cases in the `cases` list.
2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - For each test case, it creates sets of unique elements from arrays `a` and `b` that are less than or equal to `k`.
   - It then identifies elements that are exclusive to `a` (`only_a`) and `b` (`only_b`), and elements that are common to both (`both`).
   - It checks if the number of elements in `only_a` or `only_b` exceeds \(\frac{k}{2}\). If so, it immediately returns 'NO'.
   - It calculates the total number of distinct elements in `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`. If this total is less than \(k\), it returns 'NO'.
   - If none of the above conditions fail, it returns 'YES'.

#### Analysis of the Logic:
1. **Checking Exclusivity and Commonality**:
   - The program correctly identifies elements that are exclusive to `a` and `b` and those that are common to both.
   - This step ensures that we know which elements can be used from each array.

2. **Checking the Number of Elements**:
   - The program checks if the number of elements in `only_a` or `only_b` exceeds \(\frac{k}{2}\). This is a crucial step to ensure that we do not have more than \(\frac{k}{2}\) elements from one array alone.
   - The program also checks if the total number of distinct elements is at least \(k\). This ensures that all integers from 1 to \(k\) are covered.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the number of elements in `only_a` or `only_b` exceeds \(\frac{k}{2}\) correctly.
   - It also handles cases where the total number of distinct elements is less than \(k\) correctly.

#### Correctness of the Program:
- The program correctly identifies the elements that need to be chosen from each array.
- It ensures that the number of elements chosen from each array does not exceed \(\frac{k}{2}\).
- It correctly checks if the total number of distinct elements is at least \(k\).

Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to choose exactly \(\frac{k}{2}\) elements from both arrays such that every integer from 1 to \(k\) is included.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**

The program is correct based on the given problem description and the provided test cases.
