Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine whether it is possible to choose exactly \(\frac{k}{2}\) elements from both arrays such that every integer from 1 to \(k\) is included. Specifically, the program checks if the number of unique elements in `a` and `b` that are less than or equal to \(k\) can collectively cover all integers from 1 to \(k\). However, this approach is flawed because it does not ensure that the chosen elements are distributed between the two arrays correctly.

Consider the following test case:
```
3 3 4
1 3 5
2 4 6
```
- The program would identify the unique elements in `a` and `b` that are less than or equal to 4 as `{1, 3}` and `{2, 4}`, respectively.
- The program calculates `only_a` as `{1, 3}` and `only_b` as `{2, 4}`.
- It then checks if the total distinct elements (`len(only_a) + len(only_b)`) are greater than or equal to \(k\), which in this case is 4. Since `len(only_a) + len(only_b) = 2 + 2 = 4`, the program incorrectly returns 'YES'.

However, it is impossible to choose exactly 2 elements from each array such that all integers from 1 to 4 are included. The correct answer for this test case should be 'NO', but the program returns 'YES'. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
