Output State: **`i` is `k-1`, `k` must be greater than `k-1`, `t` is 0, `tmp` is 0, `ans` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers read from standard input, `s` is the sum of all elements in list `a`.**

Explanation: The code initializes two new variables `t` and `tmp` with the value 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
