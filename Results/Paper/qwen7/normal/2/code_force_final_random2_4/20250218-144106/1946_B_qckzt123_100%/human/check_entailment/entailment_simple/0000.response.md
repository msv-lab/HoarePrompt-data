Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array. The solution aims to achieve this by initially calculating the maximum prefix sum (`t`) and the initial sum of the array (`s`). It then uses these values to compute the maximum possible sum after `k` operations.

2. **Key Steps in the Code**:
   - Calculate the initial sum (`s`) of the array.
   - Compute the maximum prefix sum (`t`) of the array.
   - Initialize `ans` with the sum of the initial sum and the maximum prefix sum.
   - For each operation, double the value of `t` and add it to `ans` until `k` operations are completed.
   - Ensure all calculations are done modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Initialization**: The code correctly initializes variables and reads input.
   - **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The calculation of the maximum prefix sum (`t`) is correct and ensures that negative contributions to the sum are ignored.
   - **Sum Calculation**: The formula used to update `ans` is correct. By doubling `t` in each iteration, it effectively simulates adding the maximum prefix sum multiple times, which is optimal for maximizing the sum.
   - **Modulo Operation**: All operations are performed modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large sums correctly.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles negative numbers correctly by resetting `tmp` to 0 when it becomes negative.
   - The handling of zero values and edge cases (like empty subarrays) is appropriate.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations.

Correctness: **True**
