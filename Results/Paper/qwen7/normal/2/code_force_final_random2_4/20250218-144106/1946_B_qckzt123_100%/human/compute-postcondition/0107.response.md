Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is a list of integers with at least one element.
   - `x` is the second element in the list `a`.
   - `tmp` is either 0 or the sum of `tmp` and `x`.
   - `t` is equal to `max(tmp, t)`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for x in a:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was the second element in the list `a`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be the next element in the list `a`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `x` is the next element in the list `a`, it means the current value of `x` is the third element in the list `a`.
   - `tmp` will be updated based on the new value of `x`.
   - `t` will be updated to be the maximum of the current `tmp` and `t`.

5. **Updated State:**
   - `a` remains the same as it is an external list.
   - `x` becomes the third element in the list `a`.
   - `tmp` is updated to be either 0 or the sum of `tmp` and the new `x`.
   - `t` is updated to be the maximum of the new `tmp` and `t`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `x` is the third element in the list `a`, `tmp` is either 0 or the sum of `tmp` and the third element in `a`, and `t` is equal to `max(tmp, t)`**
