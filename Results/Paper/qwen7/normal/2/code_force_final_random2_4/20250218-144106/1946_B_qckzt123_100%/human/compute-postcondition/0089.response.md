Output State: **`i` is `k-1`, `k` must be greater than `k-1`, `t` is \(2^0 \mod \text{MOD}\), `ans` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code reads two integers `n` and `k` from the standard input using `sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()`. These values are then assigned to the variables `n` and `k`. The initial values of `i`, `k`, `t`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The values of `n` and `k` are not specified in the initial state, so they are described as input integers.
