### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to maximize the sum of an array `a` after performing `k` operations.
   - Each operation allows us to select any contiguous subarray and insert its sum into the array.
   - The goal is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The optimal strategy involves selecting the subarray with the maximum sum and inserting it multiple times.
   - If the maximum subarray sum (`t`) is positive, we can repeatedly insert it to increase the total sum.
   - If the maximum subarray sum (`t`) is negative, inserting it won't help, so we use the sum of the array (`s`).

3. **Algorithm Breakdown**:
   - Calculate the initial sum of the array (`s`).
   - Find the maximum subarray sum (`t`).
   - Use the formula to compute the final sum after `k` operations:
     - If `k` is even, the sum can be maximized by inserting the maximum subarray sum (`t`) multiple times.
     - If `k` is odd, we need to consider the sum of the array plus the maximum subarray sum, adjusted for the modulo operation.

4. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly reads input and processes the array.
   - It calculates the initial sum (`s`) and the maximum subarray sum (`t`).
   - It handles the insertion of the maximum subarray sum multiple times using the formula:
     - For each operation, `t` is doubled and adjusted modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
     - The final result is computed and printed.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases where the maximum subarray sum might be zero or negative.
   - It correctly applies the modulo operation to ensure the result fits within the required bounds.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations. It handles all aspects of the problem statement accurately.

**Correctness: True**
