Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is 2 % MOD, `ans` is 2 % MOD**

Explanation: The code `ans %= MOD` updates the value of `ans` by taking the modulus with `MOD`. Given the initial state where `t` is `2 % MOD` and `ans` is `t`, the value of `ans` remains `2 % MOD` after executing the code. The other variables (`i` and `t`) remain unchanged.
