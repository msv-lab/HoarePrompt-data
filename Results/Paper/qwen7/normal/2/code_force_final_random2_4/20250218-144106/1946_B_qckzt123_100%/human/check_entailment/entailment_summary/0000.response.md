Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The initial sum of the array (`s`) is important.
   - The maximum subarray sum with discarded negative parts (`t`) is crucial.
   - After the first operation, the sum can be maximized by repeatedly doubling the maximum subarray sum (`t`) for the remaining operations.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The code correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It calculates `s` as the sum of the array.
   - It finds `t` using Kadane's algorithm, which efficiently computes the maximum subarray sum with discarded negative parts.
   - The result `ans` is calculated as `(s + t) % MOD` initially.
   - For each subsequent operation, `t` is doubled and added to `ans` modulo `MOD`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all elements in the array are negative, the maximum subarray sum (`t`) would be zero, and the result would be `s % MOD`.
   - If the array has both positive and negative elements, `t` captures the maximum subarray sum without negative parts, which is beneficial for maximizing the final sum.

5. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The use of modulo `10^9 + 7` ensures that the result fits within standard integer limits and handles large sums correctly.

Given the execution summary and the detailed analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations.

Correctness: **True**
