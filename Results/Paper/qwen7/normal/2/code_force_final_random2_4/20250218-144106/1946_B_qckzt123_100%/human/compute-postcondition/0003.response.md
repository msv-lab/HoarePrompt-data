Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `n` is an integer read from standard input and stripped of any trailing whitespace, `k` is an integer read from standard input and stripped of any trailing whitespace.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from standard input, strips any trailing whitespace, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The variable `T` remains unchanged as it was only mentioned in the initial state and not affected by the code.
