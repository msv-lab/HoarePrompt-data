Output State: **`tmp` is 0, `t` is max(0, `t`), `tmp` is 0, `T` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with one less element, `s` is the sum of all remaining elements in list `a`**.

Explanation: The line `tmp = 0` sets the variable `tmp` to 0. This overrides the previous state where `tmp` was defined as `tmp + x`. The other variables (`t`, `T`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
