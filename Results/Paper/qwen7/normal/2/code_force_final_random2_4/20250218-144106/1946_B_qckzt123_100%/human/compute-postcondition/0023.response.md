Output State: `t` is the maximum value that `tmp` reached during the execution of the loop, `tmp` is 0, `T` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is an empty list, `s` is 0.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `tmp` will be reset to 0 at the start of each new iteration and will only accumulate positive sums of the elements in list `a`. The variable `t` keeps track of the maximum value that `tmp` reaches during any iteration of the loop. Since the loop processes all elements in the list `a`, once the list becomes empty, the loop terminates. Therefore, `a` will be an empty list, and `s`, which is the sum of all elements in list `a`, will also be 0.
