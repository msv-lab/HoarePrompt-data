Output State: **`t` is 0, `tmp` is 0, `T` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `s` is the sum of all elements in list `a`.**

Explanation: The line `tmp = 0` sets the value of `tmp` to 0. The other variables (`t`, `T`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
