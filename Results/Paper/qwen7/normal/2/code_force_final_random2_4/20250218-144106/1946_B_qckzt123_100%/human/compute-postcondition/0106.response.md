Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `x` is the second element in the list `a`, `tmp` is either 0 or the sum of `tmp` and `x`, and `t` is equal to `max(tmp, t)`**.

Explanation: The code `t = max(tmp, t)` updates the value of `t` to be the maximum of its current value (`tmp`) and the existing value of `t`. Since the initial value of `t` is `max(0, t)`, it means `t` is already non-negative. The value of `x` remains the second element of the list `a`, and `tmp` remains either 0 or the sum of `tmp` and `x`. The only change is that `t` is now set to the maximum of its current value and `tmp`.
