Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `x` is the first element in the list `a`, `tmp` is equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code `tmp = 0` sets the value of `tmp` to 0. The initial conditions for `a`, `x`, and `tmp` (where `tmp` was previously less than 0) are no longer applicable since `tmp` is now explicitly set to 0.
