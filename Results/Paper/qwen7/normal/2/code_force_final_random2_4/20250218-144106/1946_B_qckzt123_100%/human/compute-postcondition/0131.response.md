Output State: `i` is 3, `t` is 8 % MOD, `ans` is 12 % MOD.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i` = 0 to `i` = `k` - 2. Given that `k` is not explicitly stated but we can infer it from the provided output states, we see that after 3 iterations, `i` is 2. Therefore, the loop will run until `i` reaches 3, meaning it will execute 4 times in total. 

- For each iteration, `t` doubles and then takes modulo `MOD`.
- `ans` increases by the current value of `t` and then takes modulo `MOD`.

Starting with `t` as 2 (after 1 iteration), doubling `t` three more times gives us:
1. After 1st iteration: \( t = 2 \)
2. After 2nd iteration: \( t = 4 \)
3. After 3rd iteration: \( t = 8 \)
4. After 4th iteration: \( t = 16 \) % MOD

Since `ans` starts at 2 (after 1 iteration) and each subsequent `t` is added to `ans`:
1. After 1st iteration: \( ans = 2 \)
2. After 2nd iteration: \( ans = 2 + 4 = 6 \)
3. After 3rd iteration: \( ans = 6 + 8 = 14 \) % MOD
4. After 4th iteration: \( ans = 14 + 16 = 30 \) % MOD

Thus, the final output state is `i` is 3, `t` is 8 % MOD, and `ans` is 12 % MOD.
