The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `k - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some value (let's call it `i_end`), and `k` remains unchanged. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `i_end + 1`.

Since `k` does not change within the loop, its value remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`ans` is `ans` modulo `MOD`, `t` remains the value of `t` modulo `MOD`, `i` is `i_end + 1`, and `k` is the same as before.**
