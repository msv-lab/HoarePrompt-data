Output State: `i` is `k-1`, `k` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations (which is `k-1`), `t` is \(2^{k-1} \mod \text{MOD}\), `ans` is the cumulative sum of terms \(t\) from \(2^0 \mod \text{MOD}\) to \(2^{k-1} \mod \text{MOD}\) modulo `MOD`.

To break it down in simpler terms:
- The variable `i` will be `k-1` after the loop completes all its iterations.
- The variable `k` must be at least as large as the number of iterations, which is `k-1`.
- The variable `t` will be \(2^{k-1} \mod \text{MOD}\) because `t` doubles in each iteration and starts from 2.
- The variable `ans` will be the sum of all `t` values from the start of the loop until the end, each time taken modulo `MOD`. This means `ans` will be the sum of a geometric series \(2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^{k-1}\) modulo `MOD`.
