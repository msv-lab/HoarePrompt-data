Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is 2 % MOD, `ans` is `t`, `i` must be less than `k - 1`**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by the value of `t`. Given that `t` is `2 % MOD`, `ans` is now equal to `t`. All other variables remain unchanged, and the condition that `i` must be less than `k - 1` still holds true.
