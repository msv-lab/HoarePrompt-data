Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` must be greater than 3, `t` is 8 % MOD, `ans` is `ans` % MOD**

Explanation: The line `ans %= MOD` updates `ans` to be `ans` modulo `MOD`. Since the initial state of `ans` is (`ans` + 8) % MOD, and no specific value for `MOD` was given, `ans` is simply updated to its value modulo `MOD`. The other variables (`i`, `k`, and `t`) remain unchanged.
