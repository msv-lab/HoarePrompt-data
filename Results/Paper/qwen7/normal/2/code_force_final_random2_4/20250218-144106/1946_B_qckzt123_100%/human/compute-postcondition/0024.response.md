Output State: `t` is the maximum value that `tmp` ever reached (or 0 if `tmp` never exceeded 0), `tmp` is 0, `T` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is an empty list, `s` is 0.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, all elements in the list `a` have been processed. The variable `tmp` is reset to 0 at the start of each iteration of the loop and is only incremented by the values in `a`. If `tmp` becomes negative, it is reset to 0. The variable `t` keeps track of the maximum value that `tmp` reaches during any iteration of the loop. Since the loop processes all elements in `a`, `a` will eventually become an empty list, and `s`, which is the sum of all elements in `a`, will be 0.
