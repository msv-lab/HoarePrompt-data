Output State: **`ii` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

The code splits the input into two integers `n` and `k` using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input, while `ii` remains unchanged as it was initially an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
