Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is either `1` or `2`.

3. **Analyze the postconditions**:
   - If `i` is `2` and `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then:
     - `r` is set to `a[2] + 0 // 3`.
     - `rem` is set to `0 % 3`.
     - `y` is set to `n - 3`.
     - `k` is set to `0`.
   - Otherwise (`i` is `1`), `k` is updated as `k - (2 + 1) * (a[3] - a[2])`, and `r` is set to `a[2]`.

4. **Determine the new value of `i` for the next iteration**:
   - If `i` was `2` in the previous iteration, it will increment to `3` for the next iteration.
   - If `i` was `1` in the previous iteration, it will remain `1` for the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` can either be `1` or `2` in the next iteration, we need to consider both cases.
   - If `i` is `1` in the next iteration, `k` will be updated as `k - (2 + 1) * (a[3] - a[2])`.
   - If `i` is `2` in the next iteration, `i` will become `3`, and `k` will be `0`.

Given these points, let's formulate the state adjustments:

- If `i` was `1` in the previous iteration, `i` will remain `1` in the next iteration, and `k` will be updated as `k - (2 + 1) * (a[3] - a[2])`.
- If `i` was `2` in the previous iteration, `i` will become `3` in the next iteration, and `k` will be `0`.

Since we need to provide a single state that covers both possible scenarios, we can summarize it as follows:

**State: `i` is either `1` or `3`, `k` is adjusted based on the value of `i` and the elements of array `a`. If `i` is `3` and `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `k` is `0`. Otherwise, `k` is `k - (2 + 1) * (a[3] - a[2])` if `i` is `1`**.
