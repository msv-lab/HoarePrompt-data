Output State: **`k` is 0, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`**

Explanation: The code sets `k` to 0. This affects the value of `r` and `rem` since they both depend on `k`. Specifically, `r` is now `a[i] + 0 // (i + 1)`, which simplifies to `a[i]` because `0 // (i + 1)` is 0. Similarly, `rem` is now `0 % (i + 1)`, which is also 0. The value of `y` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the assignment to `k`.
