Output State: **`k` is 0, `y` is `n - 1 - i`, `ii` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of sorted integers, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, and `i` is `n - 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or the most internal if statement we were inside. All the other variables retain their initial states.
