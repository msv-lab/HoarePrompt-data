Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; `k` is decreased by the value of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, as stated in the initial state. The variable `k` is updated by subtracting the value of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from its current value. Since the exact values of `a[i + 1]` and `a[i]` are not given, we express the change in `k` using the given formula. The value of `n` remains unchanged.
