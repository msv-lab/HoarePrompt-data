Postcondition: `i` is 2, `k` is adjusted based on the value of `i` and the elements of array `a`. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `k` remains unchanged, `r` is `a[2] + 0 // 3`, `rem` is `0 % 3`, and `y` is `n - 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, and `r` is set to `a[i + 1]`.
