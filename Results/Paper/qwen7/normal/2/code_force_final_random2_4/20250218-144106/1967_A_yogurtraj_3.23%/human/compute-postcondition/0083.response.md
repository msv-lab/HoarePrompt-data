Postcondition: `i` is incremented by 1, `k` is decreased by the value of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` if the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k` is false. If the condition is true, then `r` is set to `a[i] + 0 // (i + 1)`, `rem` is set to `0 % (i + 1)`, `y` is set to `n - 1 - i`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
