Output State: **`i` is 2, `r` is `a[2] + 0 // 3`, `rem` is `0 % 3`, `y` is `n - 3`, `k` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since no variables are updated within the given code snippet, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
