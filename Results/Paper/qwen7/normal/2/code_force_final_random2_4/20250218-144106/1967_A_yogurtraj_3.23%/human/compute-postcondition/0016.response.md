Output State: **`y` is 0, `ii` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the original value of `k` minus `(ii + 1) * (a[ii + 1] - a[ii])`, `a` is a list of sorted integers, `r` is equal to the second element of list `a`, `rem` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `r = a[i + 1]` updates the value of `r` to be the element at index `i + 1` in the list `a`. Since `i` is `ii` in this context, `r` is now the second element of the list `a` (as list indexing starts from 0). All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
