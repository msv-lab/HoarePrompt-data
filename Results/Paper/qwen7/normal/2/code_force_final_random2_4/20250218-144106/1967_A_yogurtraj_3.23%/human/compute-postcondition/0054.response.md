Output State: **`i` is an integer; `a` is a list of integers; `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, the condition ((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k) is true; `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`**.

The code calculates `rem` as the remainder of `k` divided by `i + 1`. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
