Output State: **`k` is an integer not equal to 0, `r` is the sum of `a[n-1]` and `k` divided by `n`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `r` to be the sum of the last element of the list `a` (denoted as `a[n-1]`) and `k` divided by `n`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `a`, `n`, or `k`, we express `r` in terms of these variables. The precondition that `k` is an integer not equal to 0 remains unchanged.
