Output State: **`i` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, the condition ((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k) is true, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 1 - i`**.

In this output state, the variable `y` is assigned the value `n - 1 - i`. The other variables retain their previous values and conditions from the initial state.
