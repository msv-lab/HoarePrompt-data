Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 (since the loop starts with `range(0, n - 1)`).
   - `n` is given as the integer input from the second line.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n - 1`. 

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0, it will enter the loop if `n - 1 > 0`, which means `n` must be at least 2.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2.

5. **Final state adjustment**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` must be at least 2.

Given this analysis, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 2**
