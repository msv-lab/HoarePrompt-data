Output State: **`y` is 0, `ii` is the new value obtained from `int(input())`, `n` is now an integer equal to the input integer, `k` is now an integer equal to the input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from `input().split()`, `r` is equal to `a[0]`, `rem` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `y = 0` sets the variable `y` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
