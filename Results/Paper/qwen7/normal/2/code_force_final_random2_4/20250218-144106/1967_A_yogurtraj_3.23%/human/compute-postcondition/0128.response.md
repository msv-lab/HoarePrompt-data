Output State: **`i` is 2; `k` is decreased by (2 + 1) * (a[3] - a[2])**

Explanation: The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2. The value of `k` is updated by subtracting the expression `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, which simplifies to `(2 + 1) * (a[3] - a[2])` or `3 * (a[3] - a[2])`. Therefore, `k` is decreased by `3 * (a[3] - a[2])`.
