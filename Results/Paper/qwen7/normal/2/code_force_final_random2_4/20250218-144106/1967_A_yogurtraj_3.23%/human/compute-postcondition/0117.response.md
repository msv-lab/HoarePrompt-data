Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is `k` minus `(2 + 1) * (a[3] - a[2])`.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is used in the expression `(i + 1)`, which means `i` is decremented by 1. So, `i` changes from 2 to 1. The variable `k` is updated by subtracting the value of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, which simplifies to `(2 + 1) * (a[3] - a[2])` or `3 * (a[3] - a[2])`. All other variables remain unchanged.
