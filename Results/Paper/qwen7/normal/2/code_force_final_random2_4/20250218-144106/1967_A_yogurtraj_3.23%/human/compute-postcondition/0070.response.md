Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the same, `k` is decreased by `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is `a[i + 1]`.**

Explanation: The variable `r` is assigned the value of `a[i + 1]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `k` are updated according to the given operations, but since the initial state does not specify the exact values of these variables, they are left as described.
