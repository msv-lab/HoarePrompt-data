The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `p`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `p`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 'B'
- `p` is 'ABCDEF'

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next character in the string `p`. The next character in `p` after 'B' is 'C'.

Since the loop iterates over each character in `p`, the value of `i` will change to the next character, and `p` remains unchanged.

State: **`i` is 'C', `p` is 'ABCDEF'**
