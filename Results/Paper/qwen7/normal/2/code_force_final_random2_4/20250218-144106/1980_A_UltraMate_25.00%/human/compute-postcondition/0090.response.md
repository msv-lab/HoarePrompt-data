Output State: **`i` is 'C', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `ans` is equal to `m` plus whatever `ans` was before**.

Explanation: The code `ans += m` increments the value of `ans` by `m`. However, since `ans` was not defined before, it is assumed to be 0 (the default value for integers in Python). Therefore, `ans` is now equal to `m`. The values of `i` and `p` remain unchanged.
