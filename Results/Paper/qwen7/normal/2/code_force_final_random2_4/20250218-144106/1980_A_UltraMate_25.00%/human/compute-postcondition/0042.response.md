Output State: **`i` is 'A', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `ans` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `s` is the input string from user, `hmp` is a Counter object counting the occurrences of each character in the string `s`.**

The code `hmp = Counter(s)` creates a `Counter` object named `hmp` that counts the occurrences of each character in the string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
