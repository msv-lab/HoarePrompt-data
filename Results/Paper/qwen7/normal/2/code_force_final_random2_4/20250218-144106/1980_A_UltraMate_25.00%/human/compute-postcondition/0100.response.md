Output State: **`i` is the next key in `hmp`, `p` is 'ABCDEF', `ans` is `2 * (m - hmp[i])` if `hmp[i] < m`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by adding `m - hmp[i]` to its current value. Initially, `ans` is set to `m - hmp[i]` if `hmp[i] < m`. After executing `ans += m - hmp[i]`, if `hmp[i] < m`, then `ans` becomes `2 * (m - hmp[i])`. The values of `i`, `p`, and `hmp` remain unchanged from their initial state.
