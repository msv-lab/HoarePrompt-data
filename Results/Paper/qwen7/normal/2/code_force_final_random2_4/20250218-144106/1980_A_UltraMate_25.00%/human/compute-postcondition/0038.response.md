Output State: **`i` is 'A', `p` remains 'ABCDEF', `ans` is 'mmmmm', `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space and assigns them to `n` and `m`. However, since no specific values were provided for `n` and `m`, they remain as input integers. All other variables (`i`, `p`, `ans`, and `t`) retain their initial states.
