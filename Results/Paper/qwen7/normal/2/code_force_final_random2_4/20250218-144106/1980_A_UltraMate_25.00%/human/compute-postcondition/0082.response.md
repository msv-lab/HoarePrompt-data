Output State: **`i` is 'A', `p` is 'ABCDEF', `ans` is equal to `m`, and `i` is not in `hmp`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += m` increments the value of `ans` by `m`. However, since `ans` was not initialized before this line of code, it is assumed to be 0 initially. Therefore, `ans` becomes `m`. The values of `i`, `p`, and the condition about `i` not being in `hmp` remain unchanged.
