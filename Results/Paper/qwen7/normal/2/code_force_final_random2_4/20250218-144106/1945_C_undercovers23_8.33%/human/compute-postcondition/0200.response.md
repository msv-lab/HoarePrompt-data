Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `zero` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `s[2]` is '0' or not, `zero_perc` is 100, `one` is 1, and `one_perc` is calculated as math.ceil(100 / (n - 1)), `zero_perc` is updated to math.ceil(zero * 100 / 3)**.

Explanation: The code updates `zero_perc` to the value of `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`. Given that `i` is 2, `zero_perc` is updated to `math.ceil(zero * 100 / 3)`. The other variables remain unchanged.
