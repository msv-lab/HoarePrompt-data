Postcondition: `final` is a list with three elements, `pk` and `mini` are unchanged, `elem` is the next element in `lst`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` equals `mini`, then `final` remains unchanged. If not, `final` still has three elements with `pk` and `mini` unchanged, and `elem` being the next element in `lst`.
