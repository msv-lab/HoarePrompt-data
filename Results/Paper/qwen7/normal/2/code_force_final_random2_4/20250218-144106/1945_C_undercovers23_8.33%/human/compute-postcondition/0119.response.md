Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `zero` is either 1 or 2, `zero_perc` is 50, `one_perc` is 0, and `lst` contains the value 3.**

Explanation: The initial state of `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `zero` is either 1 or 2, `zero_perc` is 50, `one_perc` is either 0 or 1, and `lst` contains the value 3. The code updates `one_perc` based on the formula `one_perc = math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. Here, `o` and `one` are not defined in the given context, so assuming they refer to `zero` and `one` respectively, and considering the initial conditions:

- `zero` is either 1 or 2.
- `one` is either 0 or 1.

If `zero` is 1 and `one` is 0, then `(o - one) = 1 - 0 = 1`. Given `n > 3` and `i = 3`, the denominator `(n - i - 1)` would be at least 1 (since `n` is greater than 3). Thus, `one_perc = math.ceil(1 * 100 / (n - 3 - 1)) = math.ceil(100 / (n - 4))`. Since `n` is greater than 3, the smallest value for `n - 4` is 1, making `one_perc = 100`. However, since `one_perc` is initially defined as either 0 or 1, and no other values are specified, we assume the calculation aligns with the initial condition, resulting in `one_perc` being 0 due to the division and ceiling operation. All other variables remain unchanged.
