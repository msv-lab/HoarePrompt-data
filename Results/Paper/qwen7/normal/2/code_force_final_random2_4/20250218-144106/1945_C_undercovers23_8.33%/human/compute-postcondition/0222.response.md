Output State: **The value of `mini` is the minimum absolute difference between `pk` and any of the elements in `lst` that satisfy the condition `zero_perc >= 50` and `one_perc >= 50`. The list `lst` contains all indices `i+1` where these conditions were met during the loop's execution.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `mini` will hold the smallest absolute difference between `pk` and any element in `lst` that met the conditions `zero_perc >= 50` and `one_perc >= 50` at some point during the loop's execution. The list `lst` remains unchanged from its final state after the loop completes, containing all such indices. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `zero`, `one`, `zero_perc`, `one_perc`) will reflect the total counts and percentages after processing the entire string `s`.
