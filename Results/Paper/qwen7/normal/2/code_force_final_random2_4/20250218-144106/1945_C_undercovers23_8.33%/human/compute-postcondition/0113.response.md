Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n - 1):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 2
   - `zero` is 1
   - `zero_perc` is 50
   - `one_perc` is 0
   - If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` contains the value 3.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, so for the loop to continue, `i` should be incremented to 3.
   - Since `n` must be greater than 2, it remains unchanged as long as it satisfies this condition.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.
   - `n` remains greater than 2 (no change needed).

5. **Final State**:
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` must be greater than 3 (since `i` is now 3 and the loop condition is `i < n - 1`)

Therefore, the final state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `zero` is 1, `zero_perc` is 50, `one_perc` is 0, and if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` contains the value 3**
