Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `zero` is 1, `zero_perc` is 50**

Explanation: Initially, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, and if the first character of `s` is '0', `zero` is set to 1. The code calculates `zero_perc` as `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`. Given that `zero` is 1 and `i` is 1, the calculation becomes `math.ceil(1 * 100 / 2)`, which is `math.ceil(50)`, resulting in 50. Therefore, `i` increases by 1 to 2, `n` remains greater than 0, `zero` is 1, and `zero_perc` is 50.
