Output State: **The loop will continue to execute until `i` reaches `n-1`. After all iterations, `i` will be `n-1`, `n` remains the same, `zero` will be equal to the count of '0's in the string `s`, `one` will be equal to the count of '1's in the string `s`, `zero_perc` will be calculated based on the final value of `zero` and `i+1`, `one_perc` will be calculated based on the final value of `one` and `n-i-1`, and `lst` will contain all indices `i+1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are 50 or more.**

This means that after all iterations, the loop will have processed every index from 0 to `n-2` (inclusive) in the string `s`. The values of `zero` and `one` will reflect the total counts of '0's and '1's in the string, respectively. The conditions for appending indices to `lst` will be checked at each step, and if both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` meet the criteria (both being 50 or more), the current index `i+1` will be added to `lst`.
