Postcondition: `mini` will be the minimum value between its initial value and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`. The variable `ele` remains 5. `final` is an empty list. `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n` and is greater than or equal to 50. `final` contains all elements from `lst` that have the same absolute difference as `mini` with respect to `pk`, and `final` is sorted.
