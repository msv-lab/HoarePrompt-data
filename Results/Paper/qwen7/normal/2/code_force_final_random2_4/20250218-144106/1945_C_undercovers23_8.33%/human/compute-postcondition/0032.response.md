Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; if the first character of `s` is '0', then `zero` is 2, otherwise `one` is 2; `zero_perc` is 0; `one_perc` is 50**.

Explanation: The code `one += 1` increments the value of `one` by 1. Since `one` was initially 1 (based on the condition that if the first character of `s` is '0', then `zero` is 1, otherwise `one` is 1), after executing the code, `one` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
