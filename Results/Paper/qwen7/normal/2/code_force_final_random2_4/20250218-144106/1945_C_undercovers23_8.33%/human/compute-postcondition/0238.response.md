Output State: **The final list contains all elements from `lst` where the absolute difference between `pk` and `elem` is equal to `mini`.**

In this final output state, the variable `mini` remains unchanged, `pk` remains unchanged, and `final` is a list that includes every element from `lst` that satisfies the condition `abs(pk - elem) == mini`. The list `final` will contain no duplicates of these elements, as each qualifying element is appended only once per iteration.
