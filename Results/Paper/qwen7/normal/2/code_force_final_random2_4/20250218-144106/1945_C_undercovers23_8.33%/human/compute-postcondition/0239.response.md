Output State: **The final list is sorted.**

Explanation: The code `final.sort()` sorts the list `final` in ascending order. Since the initial state describes the content of the list `final`, but not its order, after executing the sort method, the list `final` will be in sorted order. The specific values within the list remain unchanged, only their order is adjusted.
