Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `zero` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `s[2]` is '0' or not, `zero_perc` is 100, `one` is 1, `one_perc` is 33, `zero_perc` is updated to 33**

Explanation:
- Initially, `i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `zero` is either 1 or 2, `zero_perc` is 100, `one` is 1, and `one_perc` is 33 (calculated as `math.ceil(100 / (n - 1))`).
- The code updates `one_perc` to `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. Here, `o` is the same as `zero`, which is either 1 or 2. Since `one` is 1, `o - one` will be 0 or 1. Given that `n` is greater than 2 and `i` is 2, `(n - i - 1)` will be `n - 3`.
- If `zero` is 1, then `o - one` is 0, and `one_perc` remains 33.
- If `zero` is 2, then `o - one` is 1, and `one_perc` is `math.ceil(100 / (n - 3))`. Since `n` is greater than 2, `(n - 3)` is at least 0, and the ceiling of `100 / (n - 3)` will be 33 when `n` is 4, and it will remain 33 for larger values of `n` because the division will yield a value less than 33.
- Therefore, `one_perc` remains 33 regardless of the value of `zero`.

All other variables remain unchanged.
