Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `zero` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `s[2]` is '0' or not, `zero_perc` is 33, `one` is either 1 or 2 depending on the execution path, `one_perc` is calculated as `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `lst` contains the value 4, if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is also greater than or equal to 50. Otherwise, `lst` remains unchanged with its original value of 3.
