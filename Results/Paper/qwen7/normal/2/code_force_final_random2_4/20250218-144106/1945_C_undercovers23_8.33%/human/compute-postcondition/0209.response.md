Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `zero` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `s[2]` is '0' or not, `zero_perc` is 33, `one` is either 1 or 2 depending on the execution path, `one_perc` is 33, `lst` contains the value 3, `zero` is used in the calculation zero_perc = math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1)), resulting in `zero_perc` being 33.**

In this case, the code updates `zero_perc` based on the value of `zero`. Given that `zero` is either 1 or 2, and `i` is 3, the calculation `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))` results in `zero_perc` being 33 for both possible values of `zero`.
