Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of houses `n` and the binary string `s` representing the preferences of the residents.

2. **Midpoint Calculation**: The midpoint `pk` is calculated correctly as `n // 2` when `n` is even, and `n // 2` when `n` is odd. This is because the problem requires finding a position `i` that minimizes the absolute difference from `n // 2`.

3. **Counting Zeros and Ones**: The program counts the number of zeros (`zero`) and ones (`one`) in the string `s`. This is necessary to determine the satisfaction levels on both sides of the potential road.

4. **Iterating Through Positions**: The program iterates through each position `i` from `0` to `n-2` (since the road can only be placed between houses). It updates the counts of zeros and ones as it moves along the string.

5. **Satisfaction Check**: For each position `i`, it checks if the current count of zeros satisfies the condition (`zero_perc >= 50`) and if the remaining count of ones satisfies the condition (`one_perc >= 50`). If both conditions are met, it adds the position `i + 1` to the list `lst`.

6. **Finding Optimal Position**: After collecting all valid positions in `lst`, the program finds the position that minimizes the absolute difference from `pk`. If there are multiple such positions, it selects the smallest one.

7. **Handling Edge Cases**: If no valid position is found, the program correctly calculates the overall percentage of '1's in the string `s`. If this percentage is 50% or more, it prints `0` (indicating the road should be placed before the first house). Otherwise, it prints `n` (indicating the road should be placed after the last house).

8. **Output**: The program prints the optimal position `i + 1` for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
