Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is greater than 5, `zero` is 2, `zero_perc` is 50, `one` is 1, `one_perc` is 25, `lst` contains the values 3, 4, and 5, and the loop has executed `n-1` times.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the index `i` will be `n-1`. The variable `zero` remains 2 because it only increments when `s[i]` is '0', and we haven't encountered more than two zeros yet. Similarly, `one` is 1 as it only increments when `s[i]` is '1'. The percentages `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are calculated based on the counts of '0's and '1's seen so far. Since `lst` only appends values when both percentages reach 50, and given the conditions provided, `lst` will contain the values 3, 4, and 5.
Code of the loop:
for ele in lst:
    mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`, `ele` is `ele`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `abs(pk - ele)`, `ele` is the next element in `lst`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
