Output State: **`o` is the count of '1' in the string `s`; `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `pk` is defined as `n // 2`; `sl` is a list containing the characters of the string `s`; `z` is the count of '0' in the list `sl`.**

Explanation: The code `z = sl.count('0')` counts the number of '0's in the list `sl` and assigns the result to the variable `z`. The values of the other variables (`o`, `t`, `n`, `pk`, and `sl`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
