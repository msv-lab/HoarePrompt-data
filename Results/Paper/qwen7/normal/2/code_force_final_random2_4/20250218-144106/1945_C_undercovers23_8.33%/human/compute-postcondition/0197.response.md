Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `zero` is 1, `zero_perc` is 100, `one` is 1, `one_perc` is calculated as math.ceil(100 / (n - 1))**.

Explanation: The code `one += 1` increments the value of `one` by 1. Initially, `one` is not defined, so it is implicitly set to 0 before being incremented. After the increment, `one` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
