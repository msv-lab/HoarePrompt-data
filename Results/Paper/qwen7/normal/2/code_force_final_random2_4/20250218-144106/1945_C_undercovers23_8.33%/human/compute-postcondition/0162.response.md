Output State: **`mini` will be the minimum value between its initial value and the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`. The variable `ele` remains 5. `final` contains [0]. `c1` is calculated as `o * 100 // n` and is greater than or equal to 50.**

Explanation: The code snippet `final.append(0)` adds the value `0` to the list `final`. Initially, `final` was an empty list, so after appending `0`, `final` now contains `[0]`. The other variables (`mini`, `pk`, `lst`, `ele`, `o`, `n`, and `c1`) remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
