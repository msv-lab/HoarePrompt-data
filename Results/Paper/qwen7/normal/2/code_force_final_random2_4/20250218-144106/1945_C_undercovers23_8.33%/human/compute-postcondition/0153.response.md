Output State: **`lst` contains all its original elements plus the next element, `final` now contains all its original elements plus `elem`, `pk` and `mini` remain the same.**

Explanation: The code `final.append(elem)` appends the value of `elem` to the list `final`. Since `lst` contains all its original elements plus the next element and `pk` and `mini` remain unchanged, the only change is in `final`, which now includes `elem`.
