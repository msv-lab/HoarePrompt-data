Output State: **`final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` that have the same absolute difference from `pk` as the minimum difference found during the loop execution; `mini` remains unchanged, and `pk` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `final.sort()` sorts the list `final`. However, the sorting operation does not change the values of the elements within the list; it only changes their order. The variables `mini` and `pk` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the sorting operation. Therefore, the output state includes the fact that `final` is now sorted, while `mini` and `pk` retain their original values.
