Output State: **`final` is a list, `mini` remains unchanged, `pk` is `n // 2`, `s` is an input string, `sl` is a list of characters from the string `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' in `sl`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `lst` is an empty list**.

The code initializes an empty list named `lst`. No changes are made to the existing variables (`final`, `mini`, `pk`, `s`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `zero`, `one`). Therefore, their values remain the same as they were in the initial state.
