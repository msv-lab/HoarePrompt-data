Output State: **`lst` must have at least one element, `pk` is unchanged, `mini` is unchanged, `final` has an additional element `elem`.**

Explanation: The code `final.append(elem)` appends the element `elem` to the list `final`. The other variables (`lst`, `pk`, and `mini`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
