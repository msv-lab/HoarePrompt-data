Postcondition: `beautiful_count` is incremented by the frequency of the tuple `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` in `freq`, `mod_y` is updated to `num % y`, `a` must contain at least one element, `mod_x` is updated to `num % x`, `required_mod_x` is equal to `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, and the tuple \((required_mod_x, required_mod_y)\) is now present in `freq` with a frequency of 1; `num` is the first element of `a`.
