Based on the initial state provided:

- `beautiful_count` remains unchanged.
- `mod_y` is the same as before.
- `a` must contain at least one element.
- `mod_x` is the same as before.
- `required_mod_x` is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`.
- The tuple (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) is now present in `freq` with one more occurrence.

We need to determine the values of the variables that will be printed. Since the exact values of `x`, `mod_x`, and `mod_y` are not provided, we will express them in terms of these variables.

The `required_mod_x` is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`. This means that `required_mod_x` is the remainder when `(x - mod_x)` is divided by `x`.

Given that `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, we know that `required_mod_y` retains the value of `mod_y`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the following:

Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [(x - mod_x) % x], required_mod_y: [mod_y]**
