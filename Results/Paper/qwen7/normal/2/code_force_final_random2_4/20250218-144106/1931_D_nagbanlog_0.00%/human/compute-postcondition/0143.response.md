Output State: **`freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is 0, `beautiful_count` is increased by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, `num` is the next element in the list `a`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `mod_y` is updated to `num % y`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`.**

Explanation: The line `freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0` sets the frequency of the current pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
