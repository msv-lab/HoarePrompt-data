### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and compare it to the correct logic for identifying beautiful pairs.

#### Correct Logic:
A pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is considered beautiful if:
1. \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\)
2. \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\)

This means that for any pair \((i, j)\), the sum of the elements at those indices must be divisible by \(x\) and their difference must be divisible by \(y\).

#### Provided Program Logic:
The program attempts to use modular arithmetic to infer the conditions for beautiful pairs. Specifically, it computes:
- `mod_x = num % x`
- `mod_y = num % y`
- `required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x`
- `required_mod_y = mod_y`

Then, it checks if there are any previously seen numbers that have the same `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` values. This approach is flawed because it does not directly check the conditions for beautiful pairs.

For example, consider the test case:
```
6 5 2
1 2 7 4 9 6
```

- For \(a_1 = 1\):
  - `mod_x = 1 % 5 = 1`
  - `mod_y = 1 % 2 = 1`
  - `required_mod_x = (5 - 1) % 5 = 4`
  - `required_mod_y = 1`

- For \(a_5 = 9\):
  - `mod_x = 9 % 5 = 4`
  - `mod_y = 9 % 2 = 1`
  - `required_mod_x = (5 - 4) % 5 = 1`
  - `required_mod_y = 1`

The program would incorrectly identify \(\langle 1, 5 \rangle\) as a beautiful pair based on these modular conditions, but it does not check the actual conditions \(a_1 + a_5 \equiv 0 \pmod{5}\) and \(a_1 - a_5 \equiv 0 \pmod{2}\).

#### Correct Implementation:
To correctly identify beautiful pairs, the program should iterate through all pairs \((i, j)\) and check if they satisfy the conditions directly:
```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        (n, x, y) = case['params']
        a = case['array']
        beautiful_count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i+1, n):
                if (a[i] + a[j]) % x == 0 and (a[i] - a[j]) % y == 0:
                    beautiful_count += 1
        results.append(beautiful_count)
    return results
```

This implementation iterates through all pairs \((i, j)\) and checks if they satisfy the conditions for being a beautiful pair.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the analysis, the original assessment was accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for finding beautiful pairs. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

**Final: False**
