Output State: **`results` contains the value of `beautiful_count`, which is the sum of all values in `freq` where the key matches `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y); freq` will contain counts of each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair encountered in the array `a`.**

This means that the `beautiful_count` is calculated and appended to the `results` list. The `freq` dictionary remains unchanged in terms of its structure and content but retains the counts of each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair as it did before. The `beautiful_count` value is now part of the `results` list.
