Postcondition: ***`beautiful_count` is incremented by the frequency of the tuple (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`), `mod_y` remains the same, `a` must contain at least one element, `mod_x` remains the same, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, and the tuple (`required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) is now present in `freq` with a frequency of 1 if `(mod_x, mod_y)` is not in `freq`. If `(mod_x, mod_y)` is already in `freq`, `beautiful_count` is incremented by its current frequency.***
