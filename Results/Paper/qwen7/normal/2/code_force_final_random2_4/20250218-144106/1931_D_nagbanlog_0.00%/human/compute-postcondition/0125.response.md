Output State: **`num` is the next element in the list `a`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `mod_y` to `required_mod_y`. This means that `required_mod_y` now holds the same value as `mod_y`. The other variables (`num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, and `required_mod_x`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
