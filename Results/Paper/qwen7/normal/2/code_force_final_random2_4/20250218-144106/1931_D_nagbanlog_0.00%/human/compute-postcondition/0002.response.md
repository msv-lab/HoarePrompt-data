Output State: **`n` is equal to `case['params'][0]`, `x` is equal to `case['params'][1]`, `y` is equal to `case['params'][2]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the values from the list `case['params']` to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y` respectively. Since the exact values in `case['params']` are not specified, we represent them using their positions in the list. The initial values of other variables remain unchanged.
