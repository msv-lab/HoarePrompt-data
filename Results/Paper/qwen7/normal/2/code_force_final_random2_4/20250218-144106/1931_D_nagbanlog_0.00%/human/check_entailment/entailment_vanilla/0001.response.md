Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two arguments: `t` (number of test cases) and `test_cases` (a list of dictionaries containing test case parameters).
   - It initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**:
   - For each test case, it extracts `n`, `x`, and `y` from the dictionary.
   - It also extracts the array `a`.
   - It prints the details of the current test case for debugging purposes.

3. **Frequency Dictionary Initialization**:
   - A dictionary `freq` is initialized to keep track of the frequency of each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair.

4. **Iterate Over Array Elements**:
   - For each element `num` in the array `a`, it calculates `mod_x` and `mod_y` using the modulo operation.
   - It computes the required `mod_x` value that would make `a_i + a_j` divisible by `x`.
   - It prints intermediate values for debugging.

5. **Count Beautiful Pairs**:
   - If the required `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair exists in the frequency dictionary, it adds the corresponding count to `beautiful_count`.
   - It updates the frequency dictionary with the current `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair.

6. **Store Result**:
   - After processing all elements in the array, it appends `beautiful_count` to the `results` list.

7. **Return Results**:
   - Finally, it returns the list of results.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Modulo Calculation**:
   - The calculation of `required_mod_x` is correct: `(x - mod_x) % x`.
   - However, the logic for `required_mod_y` should be `mod_y` itself, not `mod_y`.

2. **Frequency Dictionary Usage**:
   - The frequency dictionary is correctly used to count occurrences of `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs.
   - The logic for counting beautiful pairs is correct.

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints intermediate values for debugging, which is useful but not necessary for correctness.

### Example Walkthrough:

Given the example test case:
- `n = 6`, `x = 5`, `y = 2`
- `a = [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6]`

The program should correctly identify the beautiful pairs:
- Pair `<1, 5>`: `a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10` (divisible by 5) and `a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8` (divisible by 2).
- Pair `<4, 6>`: `a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10` (divisible by 5) and `a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2` (divisible by 2).

The program should output `2` for this test case.

### Conclusion:

The program logic is mostly correct, but there is a small mistake in the calculation of `required_mod_y`. The correct value should be `mod_y` instead of `mod_y`.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
