Postcondition: `num` is the next element in the list `a`, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is equal to `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`. If `(mod_x, mod_y)` is not found in `freq`, then `beautiful_count` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is found in `freq`, `beautiful_count` is increased by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`.
