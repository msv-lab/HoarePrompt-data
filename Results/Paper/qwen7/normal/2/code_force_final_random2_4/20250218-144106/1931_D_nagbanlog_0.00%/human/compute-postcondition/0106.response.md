Output State: **`mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`**.

This means that the variable `mod_x` is now holding the result of the modulo operation between `num` and `x`. The initial states of `num` and `x` remain unchanged, and `mod_x` is updated to reflect the remainder of the division of `num` by `x`.
