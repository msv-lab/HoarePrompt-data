Output State: **`n` is equal to `case['params'][0]`, `x` is equal to `case['params'][1]`, `y` is equal to `case['params'][2]`, `a` is equal to `case['array']`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `case['array']` to the variable `a`. This means that `a` now holds the value of `case['array']`. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged as they were in the initial state.
