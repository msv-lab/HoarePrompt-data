Based on the initial state provided:

- `beautiful_count` is incremented by 1.
- `mod_y` is updated to `num % y`.
- `a` must contain at least one element.
- `mod_x` is updated to `num % x`.
- `required_mod_x` is equal to `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`.
- The tuple \((required_mod_x, required_mod_y)\) is now present in `freq` with a frequency of 2 if \((mod_x, mod_y)\) was already in `freq`; otherwise, the tuple is present with a frequency of 1.
- `num` is the first element of `a`.
- `required_mod_y` is set to `mod_y`.

Let's break down the print statement:

```python
print(
    f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
)
```

- `num`: This is the first element of `a`.
- `mod_x`: This is `num % x`.
- `mod_y`: This is `num % y`.
- `required_mod_x`: This is `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- `required_mod_y`: This is `mod_y`, which is the same as the original `mod_y`.

Given these values, the print statement will output:

Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [(x - mod_x) % x], required_mod_y: [mod_y]**
