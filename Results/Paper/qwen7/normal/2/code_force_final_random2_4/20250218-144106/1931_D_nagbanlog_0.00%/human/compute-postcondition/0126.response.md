Based on the initial state provided:

- `num` is the next element in the list `a`.
- `mod_x` is `num % x`.
- `mod_y` is `num % y`.
- `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`.

The `print` statement will output a formatted string with the values of these variables.

To break it down:
- `num` is the current number from the list `a`.
- `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.
- `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
- `required_mod_x` is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`, which means if `mod_x` is 0, `required_mod_x` will also be 0; otherwise, it will be `x - mod_x`.
- `required_mod_y` is simply `mod_y`.

Therefore, the output will be a string that includes these values.

Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [mod_y]**
