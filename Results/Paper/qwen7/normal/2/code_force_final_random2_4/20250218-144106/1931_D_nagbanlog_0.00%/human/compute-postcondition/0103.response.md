Output State: **`beautiful_count` is 0, `case` is `case['params']` containing `n`, `x`, and `y`, `test_cases` must have more elements to process, `a` is assigned the value of `case['array']`, and an empty dictionary `freq` is created.**

Explanation: The code initializes `beautiful_count` to 0. This assignment does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the values of `case`, `test_cases`, `a`, and `freq` remain unchanged from their initial states.
