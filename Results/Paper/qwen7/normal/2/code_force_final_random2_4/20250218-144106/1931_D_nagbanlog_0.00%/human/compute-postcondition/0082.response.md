Output State: **`freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is incremented by 1, `beautiful_count` is increased by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` by 1. The other variables (`beautiful_count`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`) remain unchanged from their previous states. The precondition that `(mod_x, mod_y)` is not in `freq` and thus `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is set to 1 is no longer applicable since the value has been incremented by 1.
