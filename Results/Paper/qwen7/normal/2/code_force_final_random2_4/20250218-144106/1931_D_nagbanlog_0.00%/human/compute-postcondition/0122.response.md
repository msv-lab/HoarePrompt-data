Output State: **`num` is the next element in the list `a`, `mod_x` is `num % x`**

Explanation: The code calculates the modulus of `num` with respect to `x` and assigns it to `mod_x`. The value of `num` remains the same as it was in the initial state, and `mod_x` is now defined as `num % x`. The other variables (`beautiful_count` and `freq`) are not affected by this line of code.
