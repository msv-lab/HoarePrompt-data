Output State: **`cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, s)`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the first line of input from stdin with leading and trailing whitespace removed.**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(n, s)` to the list `cases`. The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states, and `cases` now contains one tuple with these values.
