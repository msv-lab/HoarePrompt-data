### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function reads the input and stores each test case in a list of tuples. Each tuple contains the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the initial state of the coins.
   - The logic here is correct and matches the problem statement.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function takes a single test case (a tuple containing `n` and `s`) and calculates the number of coins facing up (`ups`).
   - If the number of coins facing up (`ups`) is even, it returns `'YES'` (indicating Alice wins), otherwise it returns `'NO'` (indicating Bob wins).
   - The logic here is also correct based on the problem statement. The key insight is that if the number of coins facing up is even, Alice can always force a win by playing optimally.

3. **Main Execution**:
   - The original assessment correctly noted that the main part of the code should call `func_1` to get all test cases and then process each test case using `func_2`.
   - However, the original assessment did not include the actual main execution part of the code, which is crucial for the program to run correctly. Without the main execution part, the program cannot be fully evaluated.

To ensure the program is correct, we need to add the main execution part. Here is the complete program with the main execution added:

```python
import sys

# Function 1:
def func_1():
    t = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
        s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
        cases.append((n, s))
    return cases

# Function 2:
def func_2(case):
    ups = sum((1 for c in case[1] if c == 'U'))
    return 'YES' if ups % 2 else 'NO'

# Main Execution:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    cases = func_1()
    for case in cases:
        print(func_2(case))
```

With this addition, the program now correctly processes all test cases and prints the results. Therefore, the original assessment was accurate in its analysis of the logic within the functions, but it missed the main execution part.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
