Output State: **`cases` is a list containing one tuple `(n, s)`, `s` is the first line of input from stdin with leading and trailing whitespace removed.**

Explanation: The code reads a line from standard input using `sys.stdin.readline()` and strips any leading or trailing whitespace using `strip()`. This line is then assigned to the variable `s`. The value of `cases` remains unchanged, and `n` is not directly affected by this code snippet. Therefore, `cases` is still a list containing one tuple `(n, s)`, and `s` now holds the stripped input.
