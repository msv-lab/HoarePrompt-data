t is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and the second line contains a string s of length n consisting of "U" and "D" representing the orientation of the coins (facing up or down).
