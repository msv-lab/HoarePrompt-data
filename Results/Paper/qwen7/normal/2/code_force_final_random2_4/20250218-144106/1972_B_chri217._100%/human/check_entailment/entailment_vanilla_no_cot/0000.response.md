Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function reads the input and organizes the test cases into a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the number of coins (`n`) and the string representing the initial state of the coins (`s`). This part is implemented correctly.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function calculates the number of coins facing up (`ups`). If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. The logic is correct because:
   - If there are an odd number of facing-up coins, Alice can always make a move that leaves an even number of facing-up coins for Bob, ensuring she eventually wins.
   - If there are an even number of facing-up coins, Bob can mirror Alice's moves, ensuring he eventually wins.

3. **Overall Structure**: The program processes each test case by calling `func_2` for each case and prints the result. The structure and flow of the program match the problem requirements.

Given this analysis, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given examples and any other valid inputs within the specified constraints.
