Output State: **`cases` is a list containing three elements: the first two elements are the original tuples (n, s) read from standard input and stripped, and the third element is another tuple (n, s) read from standard input and stripped.**

Explanation: The code snippet `cases.append((n, s))` appends a new tuple `(n, s)` to the list `cases`. Since `n` and `s` are read from standard input and stripped, they are added as a new tuple to the existing list. The initial state had `cases` containing two tuples, and now it contains three tuples: the original two plus the newly appended one.
