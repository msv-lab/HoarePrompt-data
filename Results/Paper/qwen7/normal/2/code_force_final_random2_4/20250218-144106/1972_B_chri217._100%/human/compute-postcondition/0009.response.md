Output State: **`cases` is a list containing two tuples, the first tuple is (n, s), the second tuple is also (n, s)**.

Explanation: The code `cases.append((n, s))` adds a new tuple `(n, s)` to the list `cases`. Since `s` is the first line of input from stdin with leading and trailing whitespace removed, and initially `cases` contains one tuple `(n, s)`, after executing the code, `cases` will contain two identical tuples `(n, s)`.
