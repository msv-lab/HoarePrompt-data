Output State: **`cases` is a list containing two tuples (n, s), the first tuple is (n, s), the second tuple is also (n, s); `n` is an integer read from standard input and stripped.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer from standard input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and assigns it to `n`. This integer replaces the second element of both tuples in the `cases` list. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged, but since `t` is not mentioned or affected in the given code, it is not included in the output state.
