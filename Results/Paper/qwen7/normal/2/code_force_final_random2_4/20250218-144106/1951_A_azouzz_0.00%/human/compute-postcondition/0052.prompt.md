You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and end are integers such that start <= end, and both represent the inclusive range of folder names to process.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        cnt1 = s.count('1')
        
        if cnt1 > 2 and cnt1 % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        elif cnt1 > 2 and (cnt1 % 2 == 1 or cnt1 == 1):
            print('NO')
        elif '11' in s:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: Output State: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be exactly equal to the total number of iterations the loop has executed, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the value of the input string, `cnt1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`. The final state of `cnt1` depends on the conditions checked within the loop for each iteration. Specifically, if `cnt1` is greater than 2 and even, the output will be 'YES'. If `cnt1` is greater than 2 and odd, or `cnt1` is less than or equal to 2 or odd, the output will be 'NO'. Additionally, if the string `s` contains '11' at any point during the iterations, the output will be 'NO' for that iteration regardless of the value of `cnt1`.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations, the final value of `cnt1` will reflect the cumulative state of the condition checks performed on the input strings `s` throughout the loop. If any string `s` met the criteria for printing 'NO', the overall output will be 'NO'. Otherwise, if no string `s` met the 'NO' criteria, the final output will depend on the last `cnt1` value checked, which could be either 'YES' or 'NO' based on its parity and whether it was greater than 2.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes a range of folder names from `start` to `end`, where `start` and `end` are integers and `start` is less than or equal to `end`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
