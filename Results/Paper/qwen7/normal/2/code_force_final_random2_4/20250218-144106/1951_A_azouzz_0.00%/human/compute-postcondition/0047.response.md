Postcondition: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `cnt1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`, `n` is an integer entered by the user, `s` is the input string from the user, `cnt1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`. If the string `s` contains '11', the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. If the string `s` does not contain '11', the postcondition also remains the same as the precondition.**
