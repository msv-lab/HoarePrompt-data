Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `cnt1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`, `n` is an integer entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value entered by the user (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
