Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description.

### Problem Description Analysis:
The problem description is not explicitly provided in the given snippet, but we can infer that the task involves generating `.py` files (`ac.py` and `wa.py`) for each `.html` file found in subfolders whose names fall within a specified range of integers.

### Given Program Analysis:

1. **Function Definition and Main Execution:**
   - The function `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end)` is defined to generate `.py` files from `.html` files in subdirectories.
   - The main execution block calls `generate_files_for_html_in_range(1951, 1980)`.

2. **Subdirectory and File Handling:**
   - The current directory is scanned for subdirectories.
   - For each subdirectory, it checks if the name is an integer within the specified range.
   - If so, it lists all `.html` files in that subdirectory.
   - For each `.html` file, it generates corresponding `.py` files (`ac.py` and `wa.py`) and prints the results.

3. **File Generation Logic:**
   - The logic correctly identifies `.html` files and creates corresponding `.py` files with appropriate names.
   - It ensures that the generated files are empty by closing them immediately after creation.

4. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The provided `func_1()` function is not used in the main execution block, which suggests it might be part of another problem or unrelated to the current task.
   - This function reads input values and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on certain conditions involving the string 's', but this is not relevant to the task of generating `.py` files from `.html` files.

### Conclusion:
- The given program focuses solely on generating `.py` files from `.html` files within a specified range of subdirectory names.
- The logic for generating these files is correct and follows the problem description accurately.
- The irrelevant `func_1()` function does not affect the correctness of the file generation process.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
