Reasoning:
The provided program consists of two separate functions and does not logically fit together as described. The `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function is intended to create `.py` files from `.html` files in specific folders, but the annotated program does not call this function. Instead, it defines and calls a function `func_1()` which processes a series of input strings based on certain conditions. 

Given the problem description and the annotated program, there is no logical connection between the two parts of the code. The annotated program does not relate to the task of generating Python files from HTML files in specified directories. Therefore, the given program is not correct based on the provided problem description.

Correctness: **False**
