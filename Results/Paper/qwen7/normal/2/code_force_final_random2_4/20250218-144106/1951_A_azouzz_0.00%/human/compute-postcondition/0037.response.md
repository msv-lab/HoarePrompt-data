Postcondition: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `cnt1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`. If the string `s` contains '11', the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. Otherwise, if `cnt1` > 2 and (`cnt1` % 2 == 1 or `cnt1` == 1), the postcondition also remains the same as the precondition.**
