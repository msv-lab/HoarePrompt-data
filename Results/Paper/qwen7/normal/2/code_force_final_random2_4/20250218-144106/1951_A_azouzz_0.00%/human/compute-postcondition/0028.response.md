Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the value of the input string, `cnt1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`, `n` is an integer entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the integer entered by the user to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
