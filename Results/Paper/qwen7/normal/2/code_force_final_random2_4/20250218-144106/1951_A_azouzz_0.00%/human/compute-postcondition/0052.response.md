Functionality: **The function processes a series of input strings `s` based on their content and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. Specifically, it checks if the string `s` contains two consecutive '1's ('11'), if the count of '1's in the string is greater than 2 and even, or if the count of '1's is greater than 2 and odd. If any string `s` meets the criteria for 'NO', the function prints 'NO' and stops further processing. If no string `s` meets the 'NO' criteria, the function prints 'YES' based on the last checked string `s`.**
