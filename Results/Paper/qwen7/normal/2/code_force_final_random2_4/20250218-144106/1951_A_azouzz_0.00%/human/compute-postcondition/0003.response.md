Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the value of the input string**.

The code `s = input()` assigns the value of the user's input (as a string) to the variable `s`. The values of `start`, `end`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
