Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an input integer, `results` is a list with 'no', 'no', and 'yes', `i` is 2, `n` is the integer input by the user, `arr` is the new input string.**

Explanation: The code snippet `results.append('yes')` appends the string `'yes'` to the list `results`. Initially, `results` is a list containing three elements: `'no'`, `'no'`, and `'no'`. After appending `'yes'`, the list becomes `['no', 'no', 'yes', 'yes']`. However, since the initial condition specified that `results` should only be updated to `['no', 'no', 'yes']` if the input string `arr` meets certain criteria (contains exactly two '1's and the substring '11'), and no such condition is met here, `results` remains unchanged from its initial state. All other variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `i`, `n`, `arr`) remain unaffected by this code snippet.
