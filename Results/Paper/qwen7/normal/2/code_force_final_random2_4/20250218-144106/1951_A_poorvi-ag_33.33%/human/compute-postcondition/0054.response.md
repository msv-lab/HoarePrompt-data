Based on the initial state provided, `results` must contain at least one element. Since no specific value or type of the element is mentioned, we can only refer to the general form of the element in `results`.

Given the print statement:
```python
print(r)
```

Here, `r` is assumed to be the element from the `results` list. Since `results` contains at least one element, `r` could be any value, but without more specific information, we cannot determine the exact value.

Therefore, the output will be the first element of the `results` list, represented as `r`.

Output: **r (where r is the first element of the `results` list)**
