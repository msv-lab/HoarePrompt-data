Postcondition: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an input integer, `results` is a list with 'no' appended, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the string input by the user. If the string `arr` contains exactly two '1's and the substring '11', then the list `results` will have 'no' appended to it.
