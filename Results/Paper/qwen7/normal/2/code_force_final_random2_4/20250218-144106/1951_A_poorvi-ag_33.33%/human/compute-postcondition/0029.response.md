Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an input integer, `results` is a list with 'no' appended, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the string input by the user.**

Explanation: The line `results.append('no')` appends the string `'no'` to the list `results`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
