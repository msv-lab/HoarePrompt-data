Postcondition: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an input integer, `results` is a list with 'no', 'no', and 'no', `i` is 2, `n` is the integer input by the user, `arr` is the new input string. If the input string `arr` contains exactly two '1's and the substring '11', then `results` is updated to ['no', 'no', 'yes']. Otherwise, `results` remains unchanged.
