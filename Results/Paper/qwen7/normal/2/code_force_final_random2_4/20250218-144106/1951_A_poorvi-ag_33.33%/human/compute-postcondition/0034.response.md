Postcondition: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an input integer, `results` is a list with 'no' and either 'no' or 'yes' appended, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the string input by the user.**

This postcondition describes the state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block. If the string `arr` contains exactly two '1's and the substring '11', the `results` list will have 'no' and 'no' appended to it. Otherwise, the `results` list will have 'no' and 'yes' appended to it. The other variables (`start`, `end`, `t`, `i`, `n`, and `arr`) retain their initial states as described in the precondition.
