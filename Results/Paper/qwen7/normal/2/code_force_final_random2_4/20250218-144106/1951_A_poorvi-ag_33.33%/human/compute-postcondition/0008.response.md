Postcondition: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an input integer, `results` is a list containing 'no', `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string from input. If the string `arr` contains exactly two '1's and the substring '11', then `results` remains a list containing 'no'. Otherwise, the postcondition does not change, meaning `results` is still a list containing 'no', `i` is still 0, and other variables retain their original states.
