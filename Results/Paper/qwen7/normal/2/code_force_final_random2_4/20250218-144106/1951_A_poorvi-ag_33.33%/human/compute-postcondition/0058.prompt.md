Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is the input integer provided by the last iteration, `results` is a list containing three elements based on the conditions checked in each iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is the integer input by the user in the last iteration, `arr` is the string input by the user in the last iteration. 

If in any of the three iterations, the input string `arr` contained exactly two '1's and the substring '11', then `results` will contain 'no', 'no', and 'yes'. Otherwise, `results` will contain 'no', 'no', and 'no'. The value of `i` will be 2 because the loop has completed its iterations, and `n` and `arr` will be the values provided in the last iteration of the loop.
Code of the loop:
for r in results:
    print(r)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: State:

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `results` must contain at least one element

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `results` must contain at least two elements, `r` is the second element in the list




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
