#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and end are integers such that start <= end, and both start and end represent valid folder names in the current directory, where each folder name is a digit string.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if arr.count('1') == 2 and '11' in arr:
            results.append('no')
        
        if arr.count('1') % 2 == 0:
            if arr.count('1') == 2 and '11' in arr:
                results.append('no')
            else:

    #State: Output State: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is the input integer provided by the last iteration, `results` is a list containing three elements based on the conditions checked in each iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is the integer input by the user in the last iteration, `arr` is the string input by the user in the last iteration. 
    #
    #If in any of the three iterations, the input string `arr` contained exactly two '1's and the substring '11', then `results` will contain 'no', 'no', and 'yes'. Otherwise, `results` will contain 'no', 'no', and 'no'. The value of `i` will be 2 because the loop has completed its iterations, and `n` and `arr` will be the values provided in the last iteration of the loop.
    for r in results:
        print(r)
        
    #State: Output State: `results` is ['no', 'no', 'yes'], `i` is 2, `n` is the integer input by the user in the last iteration, `arr` is the string input by the user in the last iteration.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the `results` list will contain three elements as per the given conditions. Since the problem states that if the input string `arr` contained exactly two '1's and the substring '11' in any of the three iterations, the `results` will contain 'no', 'no', and 'yes'. Given that this condition was met in the third iteration, the `results` list will be ['no', 'no', 'yes']. The value of `i` remains 2 because the loop has completed its iterations. The values of `n` and `arr` will be the ones provided in the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads three integers `t`, `n`, and strings `arr` from the user, processes them according to specific conditions, and stores the results in a list `results`. After processing, it prints the contents of `results`. If any of the three strings `arr` contains exactly two '1's and the substring '11', the list `results` will contain 'no', 'no', and 'yes'. Otherwise, `results` will contain 'no', 'no', and 'no'.
