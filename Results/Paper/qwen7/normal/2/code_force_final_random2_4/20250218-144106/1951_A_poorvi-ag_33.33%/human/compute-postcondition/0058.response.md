Output State: `results` is ['no', 'no', 'yes'], `i` is 2, `n` is the integer input by the user in the last iteration, `arr` is the string input by the user in the last iteration.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the `results` list will contain three elements as per the given conditions. Since the problem states that if the input string `arr` contained exactly two '1's and the substring '11' in any of the three iterations, the `results` will contain 'no', 'no', and 'yes'. Given that this condition was met in the third iteration, the `results` list will be ['no', 'no', 'yes']. The value of `i` remains 2 because the loop has completed its iterations. The values of `n` and `arr` will be the ones provided in the last iteration of the loop.
