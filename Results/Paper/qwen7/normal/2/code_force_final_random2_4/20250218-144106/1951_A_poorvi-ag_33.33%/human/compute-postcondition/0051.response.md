Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is the variable `r` which iterates over the `results` list. Therefore, the only object in the loop head is `r`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `r`**: Since `r` iterates over the `results` list, the initial value of `r` will be the first element of the `results` list.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `results` list. Given the problem description, the `results` list will contain either 'no', 'no', 'yes' or 'no', 'no', 'no' after the loop completes.

4. **Initial state of `results`**: The problem states that if in any of the three iterations, the input string `arr` contained exactly two '1's and the substring '11', then `results` will contain 'no', 'no', and 'yes'. Otherwise, `results` will contain 'no', 'no', and 'no'. Since the loop has completed its iterations, `results` will be one of these two possible lists.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that the initial value of `r` is the first element of the `results` list. Given the possible values of `results`, the first element will be either 'no' or 'no'.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the initial value of `r` in the `results` list.

**State:**
- `start` is an integer
- `end` is an integer
- `t` is the input integer provided by the last iteration
- `results` is a list containing either ['no', 'no', 'yes'] or ['no', 'no', 'no']
- `i` is 2
- `n` is the integer input by the user in the last iteration
- `arr` is the string input by the user in the last iteration

Since `r` is the first element of `results`, the initial value of `r` will be either 'no' or 'no'.

**Final State:**
State: **`total` is 0, `results` is a list containing either ['no', 'no', 'yes'] or ['no', 'no', 'no'], `i` is 2, `n` is the integer input by the user in the last iteration, `arr` is the string input by the user in the last iteration**
