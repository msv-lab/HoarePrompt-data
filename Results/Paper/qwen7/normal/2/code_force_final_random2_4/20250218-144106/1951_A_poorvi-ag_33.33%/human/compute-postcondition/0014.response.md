Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an input integer, `results` is a list containing 'no', 'no', `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string from input. The count of '1' in `arr` is exactly 2, and the substring '11' exists in `arr`.**

Explanation: The line `results.append('no')` appends the string `'no'` to the list `results`. Initially, `results` contains one element `'no'`. After appending, `results` will contain two elements: `'no'` and `'no'`. The other variables remain unchanged.
