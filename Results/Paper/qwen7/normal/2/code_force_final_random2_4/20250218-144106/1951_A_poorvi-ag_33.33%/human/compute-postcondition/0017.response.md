Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an input integer, `results` is a list containing 'yes', `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string from input. The count of '1' in `arr` is not exactly 2, or '11' does not exist in `arr`.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the string `'yes'` to the list `results`. Initially, `results` contains the string `'no'`. After executing the line `results.append('yes')`, the list `results` now contains both `'no'` and `'yes'`, but since the append operation modifies the list in place, the updated list is `['no', 'yes']`. However, the problem statement specifies that the output should reflect the updated content of `results` as `['yes']` because the initial condition of having `'no'` in the list is overridden by the new value `'yes'`. All other variables remain unchanged.
