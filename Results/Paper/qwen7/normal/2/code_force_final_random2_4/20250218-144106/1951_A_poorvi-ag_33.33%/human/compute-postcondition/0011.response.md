Postcondition: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an input integer, `results` is a list containing 'no', `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string from input. If the count of '1' in `arr` is even, then the count of '1' in `arr` is exactly 2, and the substring '11' exists in `arr`. Otherwise, the list `results` remains unchanged as ['no'], `i` is still 0, `n` is unchanged, and `arr` remains the same string.
