Functionality: **The function reads three integers `t`, `n`, and strings `arr` from the user, processes them according to specific conditions, and stores the results in a list `results`. After processing, it prints the contents of `results`. If any of the three strings `arr` contains exactly two '1's and the substring '11', the list `results` will contain 'no', 'no', and 'yes'. Otherwise, `results` will contain 'no', 'no', and 'no'.**
