Output State: `results` contains ['no', 'no', 'yes'], `i` is 2, `n` is the integer input by the user in the last iteration, `arr` is the string input by the user in the last iteration.

Explanation: Based on the given conditions, the loop checks if the input string `arr` contains exactly two '1's and the substring '11'. If this condition is met, the third element in the `results` list is set to 'yes'. Given that the output state after the third iteration shows `results` as ['no', 'no', 'yes'], it means the condition was met in the third iteration. Since the loop has completed its iterations, `i` remains 2, and `n` and `arr` retain their values from the last iteration.
