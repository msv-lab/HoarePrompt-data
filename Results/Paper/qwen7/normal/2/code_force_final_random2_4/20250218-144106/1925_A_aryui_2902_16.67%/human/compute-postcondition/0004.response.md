Functionality: **The function reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from standard input, where \( 1 \leq n \leq 26 \) and \( 1 \leq k \leq 26 \). It then constructs and returns a string consisting of the substring of the predefined string \( s = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw' \) from index 0 to \( k \) (inclusive), repeated \( n \) times.**
