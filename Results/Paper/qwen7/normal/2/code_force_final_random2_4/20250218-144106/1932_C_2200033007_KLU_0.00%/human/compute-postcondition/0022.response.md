Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` is a positive integer; `b` is a list with an additional element `a[r]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(a[r])` appends the element `a[r]` to the list `b`. Since `a` and `r` are not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value added to the list `b`. However, we know that `b` now contains one more element than before, which is `a[r]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
