Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, and `b` is a list with an additional element `a[l]`.**

The code snippet `b.append(a[l])` appends the element `a[l]` to the list `b`. Since `a` and `l` are not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value added to the list `b`. However, we know that `b` now contains all its original elements plus the new element `a[l]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
