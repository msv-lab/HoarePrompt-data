Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly describes the steps required to solve the problem.
2. The function `func_1` processes the array `a` according to the commands in `s` and calculates the required remainders.
3. The logic for appending elements to `b` based on the commands 'L' and 'R' is correct.
4. The calculation of the cumulative product in reverse order and appending it to `ans` is also correct.
5. The final return statement reverses the list `ans` before returning it, which matches the expected output format.

Given the description and the annotated program, the function `func_1` appears to correctly implement the solution as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
