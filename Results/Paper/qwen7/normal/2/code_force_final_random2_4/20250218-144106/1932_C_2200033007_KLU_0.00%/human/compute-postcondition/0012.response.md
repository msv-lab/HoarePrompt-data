Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `b` is a list.

4. **Loop Body Analysis**:
   - If the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'L', then `l` is increased by 1 and `b` contains the element `a[l]`.
   - If the character at index `i` of string `s` is not 'L', then `b` contains the element `a[r-1]`.

5. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, the loop will execute again if `i < n` (which it will, because `n` is a positive integer).
   - After the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1.

6. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged and must still be a positive integer.
   - `b` will be adjusted based on the character at index `i` of string `s`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, and `b` is a list**.
