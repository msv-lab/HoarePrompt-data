Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n)`. This means the loop will iterate over values of `i` starting from 0 up to `n-1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of loop head variables**:
   - `i`: The variable `i` starts at 0.
   - `n`: The variable `n` is already defined as a positive integer.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Since `i` starts at 0 and `n` is a positive integer, the loop will definitely execute at least once (when `i` is 0).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` should be set to 0.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is already a positive integer.
   - Other variables (`l`, `m`, `a`, `s`, `b`, `r`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer**
