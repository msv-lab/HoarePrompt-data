Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for v in reversed(b):`. The objects involved here are `v`, `b`, and the function `reversed`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `v` is a variable that will take each element from the reversed list `b` during each iteration.
   - `b` is a list that contains all elements from `a` in the order specified by `s`.
   - The function `reversed` is used to reverse the list `b`.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, the list `b` must contain at least one element because the loop iterates over each element in the reversed list `b`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `v` is a variable that changes with each iteration, its initial value is not relevant for the loop condition.
   - `b` must be a non-empty list for the loop to execute.
   - The initial values of `ans`, `p`, and `i` are not directly relevant to the loop condition.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are related to `b` ensuring it is a non-empty list.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`b` must be a non-empty list**
