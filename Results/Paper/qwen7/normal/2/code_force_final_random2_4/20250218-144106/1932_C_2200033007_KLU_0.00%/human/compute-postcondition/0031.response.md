Output State: **`b` is a non-empty list, `p` is `p * v`.**

Explanation: The code `p = p * v` multiplies the value of `p` by `v`. However, since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `p` and `v`, we can only express the updated value of `p` as `p * v`. The list `b` remains unchanged as it was initially described as a non-empty list and no operation was performed on it.
