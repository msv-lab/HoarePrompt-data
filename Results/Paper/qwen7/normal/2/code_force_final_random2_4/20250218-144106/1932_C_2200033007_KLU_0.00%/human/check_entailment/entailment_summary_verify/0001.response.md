### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identified that the provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not compute the remainders of the products of the array elements as required. Instead, it simply appends the elements of the array `a` to the list `b` based on the direction of the command ('L' or 'R') and then reverses this list before returning it. This is evident from the following points:

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` does not compute the remainders of the products of the array elements. It merely appends elements to the list `b` based on the command direction.
   - The logic inside the loop in `func_1` is incorrect because it appends elements to `b` without considering the product modulo `m` at each step.

2. **Incorrect Product Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the product in reverse order but does not use the actual remainders of the products as required by the problem statement.
   - The variable `p` accumulates the product of the elements in `b` in reverse order, but this does not reflect the required remainders of the products of the array elements after each command.

3. **Output Mismatch:**
   - The function `func_1` returns the reversed list `ans`, which is not what the problem requires. The problem requires the remainders of the products at each step, not the elements themselves.

Given the above points, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not compute the remainders of the products of the array elements as specified in the problem statement.
