### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement. Let's break down the issues and verify the program's behavior using the annotated version:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is intended to handle the logic of processing the commands and calculating the required remainders.
   - However, the function `func_1` does not perform the actual calculation of the remainders of the products of the array elements as specified in the problem statement.
   - Instead, it simply appends the elements of the array `a` to the list `b` based on the direction of the command ('L' or 'R') and then reverses this list before returning it.

3. **Product Calculation and Remainder:**
   - The problem requires calculating the remainder of the product of the remaining elements of the array `a` after each command.
   - The function `func_1` does not compute these remainders; it only processes the commands to decide which elements to append to the list `b`.
   - After appending the elements, it calculates the product in reverse order but does not use the actual remainders of the products as required.

4. **Reversal and Output:**
   - The function `func_1` returns the reversed list `ans`, which is not what the problem requires.
   - The problem requires the remainders of the products at each step, not the elements themselves.

To validate this, let's consider the annotated version of the code:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v
        ans.append(p)
    return reversed(ans)
```

- **Initial State:**
  - `n` is a positive integer.
  - `m` is a positive integer.
  - `a` is a list of `n` positive integers.
  - `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.

- **After the loop:**
  - `b` contains the elements of `a` in the order specified by `s`.
  - `p` holds the product of all elements in `b`.
  - `ans` contains the cumulative product of all elements in `b` in reverse order.

- **Return Statement:**
  - The function returns the reversed list `ans`, which is not the required output.

Given that the function `func_1` does not compute the required remainders of the products at each step, the program is incorrect according to the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not compute the required remainders of the products of the array elements as specified in the problem statement.
