Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` is a positive integer; `s[i]` is 'L'; `b` is a list with one element which is `a[l]`; `l` is increased by 1.**

The code `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Since `i`, `n`, `s`, and `b` are not directly affected by this line of code, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the incremented value of `l`.
