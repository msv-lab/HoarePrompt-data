Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 32
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    a = input()
    l = 0
    h = 0
    for j in a:
        if j == 'A':
            l += 1
        else:
            h += 1
    if l > h:
        print('A')
    else:
        print('B')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a` is a non-empty string, `j` is the last character in the string `a`, the variable `l` represents the total count of 'A' characters in `a`, and `h` represents the total count of non-'A' characters in `a`. If the number of 'A' characters (`l`) is greater than the number of non-'A' characters (`h`), the postcondition remains as the initial state. If the number of 'A' characters (`l`) is less than or equal to the number of non-'A' characters (`h`), the postcondition also remains as the initial state.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is an empty string, `j` is undefined (since `a` is empty), `l` is either greater than `h` or equal to `h` (the total number of 'A' characters in the original string `a` is either greater than or equal to the total number of non-'A' characters in `a`), `h` is equal to the total number of characters in `a` minus `l`, and `i` is `i + n`, where `n` is the length of the original string `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the if-else block executes, `a` remains as the original input string, `j` is undefined, `l` contains the total number of 'A' characters in `a`, `h` contains the total number of non-'A' characters in `a`, and `i` is incremented by `n + 1` for each character in `a`. The condition either `l > h` or `l <= h` holds true based on the execution path taken.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
