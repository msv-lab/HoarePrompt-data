Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining which character ('A' or 'B') appears more frequently in a series of strings.
2. The provided program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
3. For each string, the program counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B'.
4. The program correctly compares the counts of 'A' and 'B' and prints the character with the higher count.
5. The program handles all test cases as specified, including the edge cases where the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal (in which case 'A' is printed, as per the logic).
6. There is no missing functionality or logical errors in the provided code based on the problem statement and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
