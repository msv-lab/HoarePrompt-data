Output State: **`a` is the input string, `j` is undefined, `l` is 0, `h` is equal to the total number of characters in `a` minus 0, and `i` is `i + n + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `l` is explicitly set to `0`.
- The value of `h` remains unchanged because `h` was defined as the total number of characters in `a` minus `l`, and now `l` is `0`. So, `h` is still equal to the total number of characters in `a` minus `0`, which is simply the total number of characters in `a`.
- The value of `i` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it in the given code snippet. It is still `i + n + 1`.
- The value of `j` remains undefined as it was not affected by the given code snippet.
