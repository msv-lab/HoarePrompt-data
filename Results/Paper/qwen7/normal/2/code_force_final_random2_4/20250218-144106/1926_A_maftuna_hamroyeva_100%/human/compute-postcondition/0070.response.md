Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in a`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `a`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the string `a`.
   - After each iteration, `j` will be set to the current character in the string `a`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a non-empty string.
   - `j` can either be 'A' or undefined (meaning it has already been processed).
   - `l` is 1 if `j` is 'A', otherwise `l` is 0.
   - `h` is 1 if there is no `j == 'A'` condition, otherwise `h` is 0.
   - `i` is `i + n + 1`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues based on the remaining characters in `a`, `a` must still contain at least one character.
   - `j` will be set to the next character in the string `a`.
   - `l` will be updated based on whether `j` is 'A'.
   - `h` will remain the same unless `j` is 'A' and `h` was 1, in which case `h` would become 0.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `a` must still be a non-empty string.
   - `j` will be the next character in `a`.
   - `l` will be 1 if `j` is 'A', otherwise `l` will be 0.
   - `h` will be 0 if `j` is 'A', otherwise it will remain the same.
   - `i` will be updated to `i + n + 1` (this part is already handled by the loop itself).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`a` is a non-empty string, `j` is the next character in `a`, `l` is 1 if `j` is 'A', otherwise `l` is 0, `h` is 0 if `j` is 'A', otherwise `h` is the same as before, and `i` is `i + n + 1`**.
