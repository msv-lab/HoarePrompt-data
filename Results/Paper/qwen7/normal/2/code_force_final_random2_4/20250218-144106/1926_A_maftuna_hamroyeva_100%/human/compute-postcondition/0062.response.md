Output State: **`a` is the input string, `j` is undefined, `l` is 0, `h` is 0, and `i` is `i + n + 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `h` is reassigned to 0, overriding its previous value which was equal to the total number of characters in `a` minus 0 (which is simply the length of `a`). The other variables (`a`, `j`, `l`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
