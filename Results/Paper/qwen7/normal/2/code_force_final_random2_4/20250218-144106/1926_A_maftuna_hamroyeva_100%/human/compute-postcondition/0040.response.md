Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in a:`. This means the variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `a`.

2. **Understand the postcondition at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a non-empty string.
   - `j` is the last character of `a`.
   - `l` is either 1 or 0 depending on whether `j` is 'A'.
   - `h` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `j` is not 'A'.
   - `i` is `i + 1`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments needed for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each character in the string `a`, the variable `j` will change to the next character in the string.
   - The variable `a` remains the same because the loop is iterating over its characters but does not modify `a` itself.
   - The variable `i` is incremented by 1, so it will be `i + 1` in the next iteration.

Given these points, we need to adjust the states of `j` and `i` for the next iteration. 

- `j` will be the second-to-last character of `a` (since it was the last character in the previous iteration).
- `i` will be `i + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `a` is a non-empty string, `j` is the second-to-last character of `a`, `l` is either 1 or 0 depending on whether `j` is 'A', `h` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `j` is not 'A', and `i` is `i + 2`.**
