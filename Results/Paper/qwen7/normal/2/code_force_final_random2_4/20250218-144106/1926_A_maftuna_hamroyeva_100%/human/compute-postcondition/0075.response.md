Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `j` (the current character being processed) and `a` (the string being iterated over).

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are more characters in the string `a`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a non-empty string.
   - `j` is the next character in `a`.
   - `l` is 1 if `j` is 'A', otherwise `l` is 0.
   - `h` is 0 if `j` is 'A', otherwise `h` is 1.
   - `i` is `i + n + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each character in `a`, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is the current character.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be the next character in `a`.
   - Therefore, `j` will be the next character in `a`.
   - `l` and `h` will be updated based on the value of `j` ('A' or not).
   - `i` will be updated to `i + n + 1`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `a` remains the same since it is the string being iterated over.
   - `j` becomes the next character in `a`.
   - `l` is 1 if `j` is 'A', otherwise `l` is 0.
   - `h` is 0 if `j` is 'A', otherwise `h` is 1.
   - `i` is updated to `i + n + 1`.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a` is a non-empty string, `j` is the next character in `a`, `l` is 1 if `j` is 'A', otherwise `l` is 0, `h` is 0 if `j` is 'A', otherwise `h` is 1, and `i` is `i + n + 1`**.
