Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `j`, which is iterating over each character in the string `a`.

2. **Understand the Current State**:
   - `a` is a non-empty string with its length reduced by 1.
   - `j` is the second-to-last character of `a`.
   - `l` is 2 if `j` is 'A', and either 1 or 0 otherwise.
   - `h` is 1 if `j` is not 'A' and either 0 or 1 if `j` is 'A'.
   - `i` is `i + 1`.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be the last character of the current string `a`.
   - After the current iteration, `a` will have one less character, making `j` the last character of the new string.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `a` will now be one character shorter than before.
   - `j` will be the last character of the new string `a`.
   - `l` will be 2 if `j` is 'A', and either 1 or 0 otherwise.
   - `h` will be 1 if `j` is not 'A' and either 0 or 1 if `j` is 'A'.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from the previous value.

Given this analysis, the updated states are:

- `a` is a non-empty string with its length reduced by 1.
- `j` is the last character of the new string `a`.
- `l` is 2 if `j` is 'A', and either 1 or 0 otherwise.
- `h` is 1 if `j` is not 'A' and either 0 or 1 if `j` is 'A'.
- `i` is `i + 1`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`a` is a non-empty string with its length reduced by 1, `j` is the last character of `a`, `l` is 2 if `j` is 'A', and either 1 or 0 otherwise, `h` is 1 if `j` is not 'A' and either 0 or 1 if `j` is 'A', and `i` is `i + 1`**.
