Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `a` is an empty string.
   - `j` is undefined because `a` is empty and there are no characters to process.
   - `l` is equal to the total number of 'A' characters in the original string `a`. Since `a` is empty, `l` is 0.
   - `h` is equal to the total number of characters in `a` minus `l`. Since `a` is empty, `h` is also 0.
   - `i` is `i + n`, where `n` is the length of the original string `a`. Since `a` is empty, `n` is 0. Therefore, `i` remains undefined or unchanged from its previous value if it was defined.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print('B')`.

Given the above breakdown, the print statement will simply output the string 'B'.

Output: **B**
