Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head is `for _ in range(m - 2)`. This means the loop runs from `0` to `m-3` (inclusive). The underscore `_` is a common convention in Python to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as the loop counter is less than `m-2`.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: The only state information given is that an input is taken and stored in a variable. No other variables are affected.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**: Since the loop counter is represented by `_` and is incremented automatically by the `range` function, we need to ensure that the loop counter is such that the loop can execute one more time.

5. **Calculate the New State**: If the loop has just completed its previous iteration, it means the loop counter was `m-3`. For the loop to execute one more time, the loop counter needs to be `m-2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that the loop counter is now `m-2`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **An input is taken, stored in a variable, and no other variables are affected; the loop counter is `m-2`**
