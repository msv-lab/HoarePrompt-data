Output State: **`idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `p2` is 1, `a3` is an integer read from input, `l3` is a list of integers read from input, and `l1` has `a1` inserted at index `idx2`.**

Explanation: The code inserts `a1` into list `l1` at the position specified by `idx2`. Since `idx2` is `n - 2`, `a1` is inserted at index `n - 2` in `l1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
