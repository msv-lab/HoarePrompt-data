Output State: **`idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `p2` is 1, and `a3` is an integer read from input, `l3` is a list of integers read from input.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers using `input().split()`, converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)` and unpacks the first element into `a3` and the rest into `l3`. The conditions `idx1 >= idx2` and the values of `idx1`, `idx2`, and `p2` remain unchanged.
