Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `p1` and `p2` are as determined by the loop's conditions, `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `val` is an empty list, `l2` has a new element `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, `l` is equal to `l2`**.

Explanation: The line `l = l2` assigns the value of `l2` to `l`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged. The value of `l2` includes a new element `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, which is `n - 2`.
