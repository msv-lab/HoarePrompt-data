Output State: **`val` must still contain more pairs and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since the initial state mentions that `val` must still contain more pairs, the `break` statement does not alter the content of `val`. It only indicates that we have exited the most internal loop or conditional block where the `break` statement was used.
