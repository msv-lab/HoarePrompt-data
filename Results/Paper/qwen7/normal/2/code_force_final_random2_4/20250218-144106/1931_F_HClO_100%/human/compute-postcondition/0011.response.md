Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer and equals 1, `a1` is the first integer input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers input excluding the second input integer `a2`, `a2` is the second integer input, and `l2` is a list of the remaining integers input after the first two integers.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `l11` that contains elements from `l1` (excluding the first list) that are not equal to `a2`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `l1` now excludes `a2`, and `l11` is the updated version of `l1` without `a2`.
