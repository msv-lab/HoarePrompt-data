Postcondition: `m` is greater than 0, `a3` is a list of integers, `l3` is a list of lists of integers, `val` is a list containing at least 1 tuple (a3, l3), and `_` is 0 or 1. If the current value of `l3` is not equal to a list comprehension that excludes all elements of `a3` from `l`, then the condition remains as is. There is no change in the values of `m`, `a3`, `l3`, `val`, and `_` in the else part since no other operations are specified.
