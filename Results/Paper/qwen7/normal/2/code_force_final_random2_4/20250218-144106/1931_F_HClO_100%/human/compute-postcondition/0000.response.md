Output State: **`t` is an input integer**.

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer, and the code does not specify any further constraints or changes to `t`, the only change is that `t` is now explicitly set to the input integer provided by the user. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
