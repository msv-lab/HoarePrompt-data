Output State: **`idx1` is n - 2, `idx2` is any value it was set to during the loop, `p1` is 1 or 0, `p2` is 0 or 1, `n` is greater than i + max(p1, p2) where i is n - 2, and the list `val` is empty.**

Explanation: The code sets `idx1` to `n - 2`. All other variables (`idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `n`, and `val`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition involving `n` being greater than `i + max(p1, p2)` where `i` is `n - 2` also remains valid.
