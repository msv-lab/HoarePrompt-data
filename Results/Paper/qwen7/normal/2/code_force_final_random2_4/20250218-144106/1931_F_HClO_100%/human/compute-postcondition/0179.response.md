Output State: **`t` is 1, `val` contains `m - 2` tuples, each consisting of an integer `a3` and a list `l3` of integers, `n` is an input integer, `a1` is an integer read from input and `l1` is a list of integers read from input, `a2` is an integer read from input and `l2` is a list of integers read from input.**

Explanation: The code `a2, *l2 = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into a sequence of strings, converts them to integers, and assigns the first element to `a2` and the rest to `l2`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
