Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `idx1` is equal to `i`, `p1` is 1**

Explanation: The code assigns the value `1` to the variable `p1`. This does not affect the values of `i` and `idx1`, which are both incremented by 1 from their previous state. Therefore, `i` is incremented by 1, `idx1` is equal to `i`, and `p1` is set to `1`.
