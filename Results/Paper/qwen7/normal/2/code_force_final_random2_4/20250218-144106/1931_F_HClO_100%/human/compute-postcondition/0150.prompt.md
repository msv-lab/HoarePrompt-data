Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Postcondition: `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 0 or 1, `p2` is 0 or 1, `n` is greater than `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2`, the list `val` has one more element which is a tuple `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is the first element of the unpacked list, `l3` contains the rest of the elements, and either `a1` is inserted at index `idx2` in `l1` (now referenced by `l`), or `a2` is inserted at index `idx1` in `l2` (which is then assigned to `l`), with the condition that `l3.index(a1)` is less than `l3.index(a2)` in the former case or greater than or equal to `l3.index(a2)` in the latter case, or if `idx1` is not less than `idx2`, `val` has one more element which is a tuple `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is the first element of the unpacked list, `l3` contains the rest of the elements, and either `a1` is inserted at index `idx1` in `l1` (now referenced by `l`), or `a2` is inserted at index `idx2` in `l2` (which is then assigned to `l`), with the condition that `l3.index(a1)` is less than `l3.index(a2)` in the former case or greater than or equal to `l3.index(a2)` in the latter case.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
    val.append((a3, l3))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `m` must be greater than or equal to 2; `a3` is an integer from the input, `l3` is a list of integers from the input starting from the second element; `val` is a list containing one tuple, the first element of which is `a3` and the second element is `l3`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of remaining integers from the input, `val` is a list containing two tuples: the first tuple is (`a3`, `l3`)

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `m` must be greater than 3, `a3` is the first integer from the input converted to an integer, `l3` is a list of remaining integers from the input converted to integers, `val` is a list containing two tuples: the first tuple is (`a3`, `l3`), and the second tuple is also (`a3`, `l3`).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
