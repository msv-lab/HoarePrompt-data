Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer and equals 1, `a1` is the first integer input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers input excluding the second input integer `a2`, `a2` is the second integer input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers input after the first two integers, `l22` is a list of elements from `l2` excluding `a1`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `l22` which contains all elements from `l2` except for `a1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, and `l2` remain unchanged.
