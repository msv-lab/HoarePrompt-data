Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `p1` and `p2` are as determined by the loop's conditions, `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `val` is an empty list, `m` equals 2, `idx1` is not less than `idx2` with `idx1` being less than or equal to `idx2`, `a3` is the first element of the input split and converted to an integer, `l3` is a list of the remaining elements of the input split and converted to integers, `l3.index(a1)` is greater than or equal to `l3.index(a2)`, `l2` has had the element `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, `l` is a reference to `l2`.**

Explanation: The line `l = l2` does not create a new list but rather assigns `l2` to `l`. Therefore, `l` now references the same list as `l2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
