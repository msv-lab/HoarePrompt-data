Output State: **`idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 0 or 1, `p2` is 0 or 1, `n` is greater than `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2`, `m` equals 2, the list `val` is updated with integers from the input, and `a3` is the first element of the unpacked list while `l3` contains the rest of the elements; `l1` now has an element `a1` inserted at index `idx2`.**

This means that the list `l1` has had its `idx2` position updated with the value of `a1`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
