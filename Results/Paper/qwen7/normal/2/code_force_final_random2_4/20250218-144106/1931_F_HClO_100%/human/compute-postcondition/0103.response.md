Output State: **`idx1` is n - 2, `idx2` is n - 2, `p1` is 1 or 0, `p2` is 0 or 1, `n` is greater than i + max(p1, p2), and the list `val` is empty.**

Explanation: The code `idx2 = n - 2` assigns the value of `n - 2` to `idx2`. Since `idx1` was previously `n - 2`, its value remains unchanged. All other variables (`p1`, `p2`, `n`, and the list `val`) remain in their original states as no changes were made to them.
