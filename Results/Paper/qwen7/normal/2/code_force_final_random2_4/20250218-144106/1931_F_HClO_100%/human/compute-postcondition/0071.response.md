Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `idx1` is equal to the new value of `i` if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`, otherwise `idx2` is equal to the new value of `i`; `p1` is 1; `p2` is 1.**

This means that the loop or conditional block has been broken out of, and the values of `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` are updated according to the conditions specified before the `break` statement was executed.
