Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is 1
   - `val` contains `m - 2` tuples, each consisting of an integer `a3` and a list `l3` of integers
   - `n` is greater than 1
   - `a1` remains as the integer read from input in the first iteration
   - `a2` remains as the integer read from input in the second iteration
   - `l11` remains as the list of integers from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`
   - `l22` remains as the list comprehension resulting in a list of integers from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`
   - `p1` and `p2` are adjusted such that the index `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n - 1`, and the elements at indices `i + p1` in lists `l1` and `l2` are not equal.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n - 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value `k` (where `0 <= k < n - 2`), and the loop will continue if `k + 1 < n - 1`.

4. **Updating States:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become `k + 1`.
   - Since `p1` and `p2` are adjusted based on the value of `i` and the condition `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, these values will remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them.
   - The lists `l11` and `l22` will remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them.
   - `t`, `val`, `a1`, `a2`, and the conditions involving `l11` and `l22` will remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them.

5. **Final State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be `k + 1`.
   - `n` remains greater than 1.
   - `p1` and `p2` remain adjusted such that `(k + 1) + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` and the elements at indices `(k + 1) + p1` in lists `l1` and `l2` are not equal.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` is 1, `val` contains `m - 2` tuples, each consisting of an integer `a3` and a list `l3` of integers, `n` is greater than 1, `a1` remains as the integer read from input in the first iteration, `a2` remains as the integer read from input in the second iteration, `l11` remains as the list of integers from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `l22` remains as the list comprehension resulting in a list of integers from `l2` excluding all occurrences of `a1`, `p1` and `p2` are adjusted such that the index `i + 1` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n - 1`, and the elements at indices `(i + 1) + p1` in lists `l1` and `l2` are not equal.**
