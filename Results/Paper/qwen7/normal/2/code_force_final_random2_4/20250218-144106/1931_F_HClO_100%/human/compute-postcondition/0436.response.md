Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `p1` and `p2` are as determined by the loop's conditions, `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `val` is an empty list, and `l1` has had its element at index `idx2` updated with `a1`.**

This means that the list `l1` now has an additional element `a1` inserted at the index `idx2`, which is `n - 2`. All other variables retain their previous values.
