Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: idx1 is n - 2, idx2 is n - 2, p2 is 1, m is less than or equal to 2, a3 is a list of integers entered as input, l3 is a list of lists of integers entered as input, val is a list containing m-2 tuples (a3, l3), _ is 0.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `m` will no longer be greater than 2, hence it will be reduced to 2 or less. The variable `a3` will be a list of integers representing the values entered during each iteration of the loop, and `l3` will be a list of lists of integers also entered during each iteration. The variable `val` will contain a total of `m-2` tuples, each consisting of an `a3` and corresponding `l3` from each iteration. The variable `_` will be set to `m-2` after the loop completes, indicating the number of iterations performed.
Code of the loop:
for a3, l3 in val:
    if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
        print('no')
        break
else:
    print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `m` is greater than 0, `a3` is a list of integers, `l3` is a list of lists of integers, `val` is a list containing at least 1 tuple (a3, l3), and `_` is 0 or 1. If the current value of `l3` is not equal to a list comprehension that excludes all elements of `a3` from `l`, then the condition remains as is. There is no change in the values of `m`, `a3`, `l3`, `val`, and `_` in the else part since no other operations are specified.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `m` is greater than 0, `a3` is a list of integers, `l3` is a list of lists of integers, `val` is a list containing at least 1 tuple (a3, l3), and `_` is 0 or 1. If `l3` is not equal to a list comprehension of `i` for `i` in `l` where `i` is not equal to `a3`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `l3` is a list. If `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
