Postcondition: `idx1` and `idx2` are both `n - 2`, and `p2` is 1. If `idx1` is less than `idx2`, then the list `l` contains an additional element `a2` at index `n - 2`. Otherwise, if `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, the list `l` is the same as `l1` with an element inserted at index `n - 2`. If `idx1` is equal to `idx2`, `a3` is an integer read from input, `l3` is a list of integers read from input, `l` is either `l1` or a list equal to `l2` depending on the comparison between `l3.index(a3)` and `l3.index(a2)`, `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`, and `m` is decreased by 1.
