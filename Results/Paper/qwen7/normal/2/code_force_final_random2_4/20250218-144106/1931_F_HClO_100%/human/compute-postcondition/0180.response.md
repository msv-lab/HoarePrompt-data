Output State: **`t` is 1, `val` contains `m - 2` tuples, each consisting of an integer `a3` and a list `l3` of integers, `n` is an input integer, `a1` is an integer read from input, `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding all occurrences of `a2`, `a2` is an integer read from input, and `l2` is a list of integers read from input.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `l11` which contains all elements from the list `l1` except for the elements that are equal to `a2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
