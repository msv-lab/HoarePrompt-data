Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer and equals 1, `a1` is the first integer input, and `l1` is a list of the remaining integers input.**

Explanation: The code `a1, *l1 = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user. It splits the input into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the first integer to `a1`. The rest of the integers are assigned to the list `l1`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
