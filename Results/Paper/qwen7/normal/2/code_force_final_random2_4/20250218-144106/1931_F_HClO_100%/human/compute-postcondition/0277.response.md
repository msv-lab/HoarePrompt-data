Based on the initial state provided:

- `idx2` is `n - 2`
- `idx1` is `n - 2`
- `p2` is 1
- The condition `idx1 >= idx2` still holds true
- `m` equals 2

The print statement is simply `print('yes')`.

Since the print statement is printing a string literal `'yes'`, the output will be:

Output: **yes**
