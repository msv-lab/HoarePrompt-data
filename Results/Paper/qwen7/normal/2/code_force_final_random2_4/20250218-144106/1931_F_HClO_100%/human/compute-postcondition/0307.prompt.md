Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Postcondition: `idx1` and `idx2` are both `n - 2`, and `p2` is 1. If `idx1` is less than `idx2`, then the list `l` contains an additional element `a2` at index `n - 2`. Otherwise, if `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, the list `l` is the same as `l1` with an element inserted at index `n - 2`. If `idx1` is equal to `idx2`, `a3` is an integer read from input, `l3` is a list of integers read from input, `l` is either `l1` or a list equal to `l2` depending on the comparison between `l3.index(a3)` and `l3.index(a2)`, `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`, and `m` is decreased by 1.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())
    val.append((a3, l3))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `p2` is 1, `m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer entered, `l3` is a list containing the rest of the integers entered, `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `p2` is 1, `m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from the input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `val` is a list containing two tuples `(a3, l3)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `p2` is 1, `m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from the input converted to an integer, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input converted to integers, `val` is a list containing two tuples `[(a3, l3)]`, `_` is `m - 2`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
