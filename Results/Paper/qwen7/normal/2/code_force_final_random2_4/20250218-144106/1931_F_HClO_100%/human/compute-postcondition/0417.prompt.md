Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `m` is 2 or less, `n` is an input integer, `a3` is a list of integers, `l3` is a list of lists of integers, `val` is a list containing `m-2` tuples `(a3, l3)` from each iteration, and `_` is `m-1`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `a1` is the first integer input, `a2` is the second integer input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers input, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding elements equal to `a1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
        break
    if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
        if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
            idx1 = idx2 = i
            break
        else:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                idx1 = i
                p1 = 1
            else:
                idx2 = i
                p2 = 1
            if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and either the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`, in which case no specific changes are made to `i` and `n`, or the sum equals `n - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Additionally, if the if condition is true, the elements at indices `i + p1` in list `l1` and `i + p2` in list `l2` are not equal to `a2` and `a1`, respectively. Furthermore, if `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`, then `p1` is 1; otherwise, `p2` is 1 and `idx2` is 0. This holds true whether `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative integers and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, or if there is no else part in the code.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not met, the postcondition remains that `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the if condition does not hold, and `idx1` is greater than or equal to 0 and `idx2` is greater than or equal to 0, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
