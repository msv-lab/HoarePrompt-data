Output State: **`idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 0 or 1, `p2` is 0 or 1, `n` is greater than `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2`, `m` equals 2, the list `val` is updated with integers from the input, and `a3` is the first element of the unpacked list while `l3` contains the rest of the elements; `l1` now has an element `a1` inserted at index `idx2`; `l` is a reference to `l1`.**

Explanation: The line `l = l1` assigns `l1` to `l`, creating a reference to the same list object. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `n`, `m`, `val`, `a3`, `l3`, and `a1` remain unchanged.
