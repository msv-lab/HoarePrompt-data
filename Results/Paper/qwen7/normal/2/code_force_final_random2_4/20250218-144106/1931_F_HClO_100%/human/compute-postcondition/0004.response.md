Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer and equals 1, and the program waits for user input.**

The `input()` function is called, which waits for user input but does not assign any value to any variable until the input is provided by the user. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged, and the program is now waiting for user input.
