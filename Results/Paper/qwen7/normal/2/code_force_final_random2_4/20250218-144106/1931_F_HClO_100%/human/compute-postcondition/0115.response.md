Output State: **`idx1` is n - 2, `idx2` is n - 2, `p1` is 0 or 1, `p2` is 0 or 1, the list `val` is empty, and the list `l1` has an element inserted at index `idx2`; `l` is a reference to `l1`.**

Explanation: The line `l = l1` assigns `l1` to `l`, meaning `l` now references the same list as `l1`. The values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`, and the state of `l1` remain unchanged from the initial state.
