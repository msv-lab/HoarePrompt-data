Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `idx1` is 2, `idx2` is 2**.

Explanation: The code initializes `idx1` and `idx2` to the value of `i`, which is 2. The conditions involving `n`, `i`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged since these variables are not affected by the given code snippet.
