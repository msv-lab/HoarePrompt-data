Output State: **`idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 0 or 1, `p2` is 0 or 1, `n` is greater than `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2`, `m` equals 2, the list `val` is updated with integers from the input, and `a3` is the first element of the unpacked list while `l3` contains the rest of the elements. `l2` has `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, and `l3.index(a1)` is greater than or equal to `l3.index(a2)`; `l` is assigned the value of `l2`.**

The code `l = l2` simply assigns the value of `l2` to `l`. No other changes are made to the variables. Therefore, the values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `n`, `m`, `val`, `a3`, `l3`, `a2`, and the conditions involving `l3.index(a1)` and `l3.index(a2)` remain unchanged. The only new information is that `l` now holds the same list as `l2`.
