Output State: **`m` is 2 or less, `n` is an input integer, `a3` is a list of integers, `l3` is a list of lists of integers, `val` is a list containing `m-2` tuples `(a3, l3)` from each iteration, and `_` is `m-1`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables and the loop is simply continued, the values of all variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
