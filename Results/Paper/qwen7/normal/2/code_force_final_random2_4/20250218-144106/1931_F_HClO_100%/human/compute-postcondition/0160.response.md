Based on the initial state provided:

- `val` must have at least one tuple.
- `a3` is the first element of the next tuple in `val`.
- `l3` is the second element of the next tuple in `val`.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('no')
```

This statement will print the string `'no'` directly without any reference to the values of `a3` or `l3` since they are not used in this particular print statement.

Output: **no**
