Output State: `idx1` is `-1` or any value it was set to during the loop, `idx2` is `-1` or any value it was set to during the loop, `p1` is `1` or `0`, `p2` is `0` or `1`, `n` is greater than `i + max(p1, p2)` where `i` is `n - 2`, and either both `idx1` and `idx2` are greater than or equal to `0` or the condition `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]` holds true until the loop ends.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the values of `idx1` and `idx2` will be the indices where mismatches between `l1` and `l2` were found, or remain `-1` if no such mismatches were found. The values of `p1` and `p2` will be `1` if there was a mismatch involving `a2` and `a1`, otherwise they will be `0`. The variable `n` will be greater than the final value of `i`, which is `n - 2`, and the loop will have broken out either when `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` or when a mismatch condition was met and the loop was exited.
