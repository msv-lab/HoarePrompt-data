Output State: **`idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `p2` is 1, `a3` is an integer read from input, `l3` is a list of integers read from input, `l` is either `l1` or a list equal to `l2` depending on whether `l3.index(a3)` is less than `l3.index(a2)` or not, and `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`**.

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. The values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p2`, `a3`, `l3`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states. The only new information introduced is that `val` now contains the tuple `(a3, l3)`.
