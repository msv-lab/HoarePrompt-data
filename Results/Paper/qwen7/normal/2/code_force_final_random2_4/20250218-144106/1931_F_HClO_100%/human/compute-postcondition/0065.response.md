Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `idx1` is equal to `i`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the current value of `i` to `idx1`. Since `i` was already incremented by 1 in the precondition, `idx1` now holds the same value as `i`. No other variables are affected, so the output state includes the updated value of `i` and the assignment of `i` to `idx1`.
