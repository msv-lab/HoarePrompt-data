Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `p1` and `p2` are as determined by the loop's conditions, `idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `val` is an empty list, `m` equals 2, `idx1` is not less than `idx2` with `idx1` being less than or equal to `idx2`, `a3` is the first element of the input split and converted to an integer, `l3` is a list of the remaining elements of the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts them to integers, and assigns the first element to `a3` and the rest to the list `l3`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
