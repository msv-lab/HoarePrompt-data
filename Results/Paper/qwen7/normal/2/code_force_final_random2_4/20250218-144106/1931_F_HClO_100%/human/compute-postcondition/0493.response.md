Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs (n and k) that are derived from a list of n distinct integers. It checks if n and k meet the conditions 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and n ⋅ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. Based on these conditions, it returns an appropriate output.**

This means the function is expected to validate the given values of `n` and `k` against specified constraints and return a result based on whether these values satisfy the conditions or not.
