Based on the initial state provided:

- `val` is a list containing at least one tuple.
- The first tuple in `val` has two elements: `a3` is the first element, and `l3` is the second element.
- The current value of `l3` is not equal to a list containing all elements of `l` except for `a3`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('no')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'no'` regardless of the values of the variables `a3` and `l3`.

Output: **no**
