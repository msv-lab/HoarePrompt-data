Output State: **`val` must have at least one tuple, `a3` is the first element of the next tuple in `val`, and `l3` is the second element of the next tuple in `val`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not modify the values of `val`, `a3`, or `l3`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it was inside. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
