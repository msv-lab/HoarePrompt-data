Output State: **`idx2` is `n - 2`, `idx1` is `n - 2`, `p2` is 1**.

Explanation: The code `idx2 = n - 2` simply updates the value of `idx2` to `n - 2`. Since `idx1` was previously set to `n - 2` and no other changes were made to `idx1`, its value remains unchanged. The other variables (`t`, `val`, `n`, `a1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, and `p2`) remain unaffected by this line of code.
