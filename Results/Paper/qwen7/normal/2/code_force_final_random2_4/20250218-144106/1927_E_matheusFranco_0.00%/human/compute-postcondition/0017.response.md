Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `len(permutation)' and `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is equal to `curr_v + 1`.**

Explanation: The code increments `curr_v` by 1. Since `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` was previously equal to `curr_v`, after incrementing `curr_v`, it becomes `curr_v + 1`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
