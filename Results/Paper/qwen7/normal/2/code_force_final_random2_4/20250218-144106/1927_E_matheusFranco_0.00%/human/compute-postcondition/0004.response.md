The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`. This means `t` was decremented by 1 in the previous iteration and is now greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0 after the decrement.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 1 before the next iteration starts, as it will be decremented by 1 again.

State: **`t` must be greater than 1**
