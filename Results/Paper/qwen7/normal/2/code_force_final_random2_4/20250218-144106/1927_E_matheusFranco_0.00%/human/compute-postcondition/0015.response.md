The loop condition is `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)`. For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `multiples_of_k_plus_i` needs to be adjusted such that it becomes less than `len(permutation)`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is at least `len(permutation) - k - 1 + k`, which simplifies to `len(permutation) - 1`.
- `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is equal to `curr_v + 1`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `len(permutation)`. Since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is currently at least `len(permutation) - 1`, it needs to be adjusted to be less than `len(permutation)`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `len(permutation)`.

No other states need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head conditions.

State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `len(permutation)`**
