Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` is at least `len(permutation) - k - 1 + k`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is equal to `curr_v + 1`**

This means that the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` has been incremented by `k`. The condition that `multiples_of_k_plus_i` was initially at least `len(permutation) - k - 1` is still valid, and now it is at least `len(permutation) - 1`. The value of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` remains unchanged and is still equal to `curr_v + 1`.
