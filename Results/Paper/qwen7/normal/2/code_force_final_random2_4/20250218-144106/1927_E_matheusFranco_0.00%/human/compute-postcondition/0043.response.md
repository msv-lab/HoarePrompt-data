Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i + k` and must be less than `len(permutation)' and `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is set to `curr_v`.**

This means that the value of `permutation` at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` (which is `i + k`) has been updated to `curr_v`. All other variables remain in their initial state, with `multiples_of_k_plus_i` still being `i + k` and needing to be less than `len(permutation)`.
