Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `len(permutation)' and `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is equal to `curr_v`.**

Explanation: The code updates the `permutation` list by assigning the value of `curr_v` to the index `multiples_of_k_plus_i`. The condition that `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `len(permutation)` remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes that `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is now `curr_v`, while the other conditions and variables remain as they were initially, except for the updated part of the `permutation` list.
