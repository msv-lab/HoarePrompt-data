Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i + 2k` and must be less than `len(permutation)`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `curr_v`, `curr_v` is the length of `permutation` plus the original value of `i + 3` plus 1, and `i` is incremented by 1 and less than `len(permutation)`**.

Explanation: The value of `curr_v` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, `curr_v` now equals the length of `permutation` plus the original value of `i + 3` plus 1.
