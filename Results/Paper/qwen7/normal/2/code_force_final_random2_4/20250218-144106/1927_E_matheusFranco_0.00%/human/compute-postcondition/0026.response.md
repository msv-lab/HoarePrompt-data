The loop condition is `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `len(permutation)`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i + k`
- `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `curr_v + 1`
- `curr_v` is the length of `permutation` plus the original value of `i + 2`
- `i` is less than `len(permutation)`

To ensure the loop executes one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `len(permutation)`. Since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is currently `i + k`, we need to ensure that `i + k` is less than `len(permutation)`.

Given that `i` is already less than `len(permutation)`, the only thing that needs adjustment is to ensure `multiples_of_k_plus_i` (which is `i + k`) is still less than `len(permutation)`.

Therefore, we need to adjust `i` such that `i + k` is less than `len(permutation)`.

State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i + k` and must be less than `len(permutation)`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `curr_v + 1`, `curr_v` is the length of `permutation` plus the original value of `i + 2`, and `i` is less than `len(permutation)`**
