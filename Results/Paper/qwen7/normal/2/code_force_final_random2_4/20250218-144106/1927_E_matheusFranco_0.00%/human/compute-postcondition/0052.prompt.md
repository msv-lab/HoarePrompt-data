Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `idx` is 1, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and k is even; `permutation` is a list of n zeros, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    multiples_of_k_plus_i = i
    while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
        permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] = curr_v
        curr_v += 1
        multiples_of_k_plus_i += k


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be equal to its original value (which is `i`), and `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` will be equal to `curr_v + 1`. The variable `curr_v` will be equal to the length of `permutation` plus the original value of `i`.

Explanation:

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i + nk` where `n` is the total number of iterations the loop runs, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `curr_v + n`, `curr_v` is the length of `permutation` plus the original value of `i + n + 1`, and `i` is incremented `n` times and is less than `len(permutation)`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be `i + nk`, where `n` is the total number of times the loop ran. The value at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_i` in the `permutation` list will be `curr_v + n`. The variable `curr_v` will be the length of `permutation` plus the original value of `i + n + 1`. The variable `i` will have been incremented `n` times and will still be less than the length of `permutation`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `i + nk`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is `curr_v + n`, where `n` is the total number of iterations the loop executed, `i` is `0` (or the initial value of `i`), and `curr_v` is `n`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be equal to `k` multiplied by the total number of iterations (`nk`). The value stored in `permutation` at the index specified by `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be `curr_v` plus the total number of iterations (`curr_v + n`). The variable `i` will retain its initial value (which is `0` in the given context), and `curr_v` will be equal to the total number of iterations (`n`).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
