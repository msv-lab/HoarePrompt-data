Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k` and constructs a permutation according to the specified rules.
3. The construction of the permutation in `func_1` ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1, as required by the problem statement.
4. The program handles multiple test cases correctly by using a loop in `func_2` to process each test case one by one.

Given the problem description and the provided annotated program, the program logic and implementation seem to align with the requirements. Therefore, the program should generate the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
