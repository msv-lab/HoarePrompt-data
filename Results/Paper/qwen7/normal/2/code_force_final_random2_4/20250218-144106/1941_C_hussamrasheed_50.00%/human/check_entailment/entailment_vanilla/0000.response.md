Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It reads the length of the string `n`.
   - It reads the string `s`.
   - It counts the occurrences of the substring "map" in `s` and stores this count in `m`.
   - It replaces all occurrences of "map" in `s` with an empty string, effectively removing them.
   - It counts the occurrences of the substring "pie" in the modified string `s` and stores this count in `p`.
   - It prints the sum of `m` and `p`, which represents the total number of characters removed to make the string beautiful.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly identifies the substrings "map" and "pie".
- However, the logic for counting and removing these substrings is flawed. The program removes all occurrences of "map" but does not ensure that "pie" is also removed optimally.
- For example, consider the string "ppiee". The program would count "pie" once but does not remove any characters because "map" is not present. This results in the output being 1 instead of 0.

### Example:
- For the string "ppiee":
  - Count of "map": 0
  - After replacing "map": "ppiee"
  - Count of "pie": 1
  - Output: 0 + 1 = 1 (incorrect)

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Identify and remove the minimum number of characters to avoid both "map" and "pie".
2. Use a more sophisticated approach to handle overlapping substrings and ensure minimal removal.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not ensure the optimal removal of characters to make the string beautiful. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
