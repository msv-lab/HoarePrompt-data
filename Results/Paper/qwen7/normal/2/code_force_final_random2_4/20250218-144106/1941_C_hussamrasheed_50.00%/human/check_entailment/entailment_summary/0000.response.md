Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of 'map' and 'pie':**
   - The program counts the occurrences of the substring 'map' and then removes all instances of 'map' from the string `s`.
   - After removing 'map', it counts the occurrences of 'pie'.
   - However, this approach fails to account for cases where 'pie' might appear after the removal of 'map'. For example, consider the string "mappie". After removing 'map', the string becomes "pie". The program would count one occurrence of 'map' and zero occurrences of 'pie', resulting in an incorrect answer of 1 instead of 0.

2. **Lack of Proper Removal Logic:**
   - The program removes all instances of 'map' but does not handle the removal of 'pie' in a way that ensures the minimum deletions are made.
   - The program should focus on removing the minimum number of characters to ensure neither 'map' nor 'pie' remains in the string.

3. **Incorrect Output Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the sum of the counts of 'map' and 'pie' after removing 'map', which does not guarantee the minimum deletions needed to make the string beautiful.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
