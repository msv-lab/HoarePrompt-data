Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program only counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and removes them without considering the order and overlapping of these substrings. This can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input string "mappie":
- The program would count "map" as 1 and "pie" as 1, and then remove both substrings.
- However, the correct solution should remove only the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful. In this case, removing only the last 'e' would make the string "mappi", which is beautiful.

The program needs to handle overlapping and nested substrings correctly to ensure the minimum number of deletions.
