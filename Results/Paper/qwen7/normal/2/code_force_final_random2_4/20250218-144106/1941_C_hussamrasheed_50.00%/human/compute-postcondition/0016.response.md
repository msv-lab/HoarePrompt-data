Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the string input by the user with all occurrences of 'map' removed, `m` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original `s`, `p` is the count of occurrences of 'pie' in the updated `s`, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
