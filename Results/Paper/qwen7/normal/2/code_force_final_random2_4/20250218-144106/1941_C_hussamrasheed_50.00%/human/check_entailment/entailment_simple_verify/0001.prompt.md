You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        m = s.count('map')
        s = s.replace('map', '')
        p = s.count('pie')
        print(m + p)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and the string s consists of lowercase Latin letters with a total length sum not exceeding 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        m = s.count('map')
        
        s = s.replace('map', '')
        
        p = s.count('pie')
        
        print(m + p)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` must be a positive integer, `i` will be equal to `t-1`, `n` will be an input integer for each iteration, `s` will be the string input by the user with all occurrences of 'map' removed for each iteration, `m` will be the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original `s` for each iteration, `p` will be the count of occurrences of 'pie' in the updated `s` for each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It reads the length of the string `n`.
   - It reads the string `s`.
   - It counts the occurrences of the substring "map" in `s` and stores this count in `m`.
   - It replaces all occurrences of "map" in `s` with an empty string, effectively removing them.
   - It counts the occurrences of the substring "pie" in the modified string `s` and stores this count in `p`.
   - It prints the sum of `m` and `p`, which represents the total number of characters removed to make the string beautiful.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly identifies the substrings "map" and "pie".
- However, the logic for counting and removing these substrings is flawed. The program removes all occurrences of "map" but does not ensure that "pie" is also removed optimally.
- For example, consider the string "ppiee". The program would count "pie" once but does not remove any characters because "map" is not present. This results in the output being 1 instead of 0.

### Example:
- For the string "ppiee":
  - Count of "map": 0
  - After replacing "map": "ppiee"
  - Count of "pie": 1
  - Output: 0 + 1 = 1 (incorrect)

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Identify and remove the minimum number of characters to avoid both "map" and "pie".
2. Use a more sophisticated approach to handle overlapping substrings and ensure minimal removal.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not ensure the optimal removal of characters to make the string beautiful. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
