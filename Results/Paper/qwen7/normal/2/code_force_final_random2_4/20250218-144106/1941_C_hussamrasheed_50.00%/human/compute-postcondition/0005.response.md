Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the string input by the user with all occurrences of 'map' removed, `m` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original `s`.**

Explanation: The code replaces all occurrences of the substring 'map' in the string `s` with an empty string. This means that `s` now no longer contains any instances of 'map'. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
