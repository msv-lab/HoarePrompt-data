Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the string input by the user with all occurrences of 'map' removed, `m` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original `s`, `p` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`**.

The code `p = s.count('pie')` counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the string `s` and assigns this count to the variable `p`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
