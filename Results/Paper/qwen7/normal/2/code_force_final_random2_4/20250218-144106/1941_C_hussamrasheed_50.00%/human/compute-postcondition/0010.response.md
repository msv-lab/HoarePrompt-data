Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the string input by the user, `m` is the number of occurrences of 'map' in the original `s`, `p` is the number of occurrences of 'pie' in `s`, `s` is updated to remove all occurrences of 'map', `n` is an integer input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `s = input()` reads a string from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. It removes all occurrences of the substring 'map' from the original string `s`, updates the value of `s`, and does not affect the other variables. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was already defined as an input integer before the code execution.
