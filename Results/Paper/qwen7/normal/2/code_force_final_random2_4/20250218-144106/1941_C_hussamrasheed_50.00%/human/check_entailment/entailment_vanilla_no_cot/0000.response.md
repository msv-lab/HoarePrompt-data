Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the code is flawed because it only counts occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and removes them without ensuring that the minimum number of deletions is made to eliminate both "map" and "pie". Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Deletion Logic**: The code simply replaces all occurrences of "map" with an empty string and then counts the remaining "pie" substrings. This approach does not guarantee the minimum deletions needed to make the string beautiful.

2. **Suboptimal Removal**: The code does not consider the optimal way to remove characters to minimize deletions. For instance, if the string is "mappie", the current logic would remove both "map" and "pie", resulting in "pie" being counted again after the first removal, leading to unnecessary extra deletions.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we should scan through the string and remove characters dynamically to ensure that both "map" and "pie" are removed with the minimum deletions. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        i, j = 0, 0
        deletions = 0
        
        while i < len(s):
            if s[i:i+3] == 'map':
                # Skip 'map' and count it as one deletion
                deletions += 1
                i += 3
            elif s[i:i+3] == 'pie':
                # Skip 'pie' and count it as one deletion
                deletions += 1
                i += 3
            else:
                i += 1
        
        print(deletions)
```

This revised function iterates through the string and checks for "map" and "pie" substrings. When found, it skips those substrings and increments the deletion counter accordingly. This ensures the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.
