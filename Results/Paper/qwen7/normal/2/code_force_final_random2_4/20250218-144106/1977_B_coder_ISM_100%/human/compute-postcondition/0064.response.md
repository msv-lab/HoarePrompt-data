Output State: **`i` is 2; `x` is an integer; `flag` is 1; `s[1]` is '0'; `s[2]` is '-1'**

Explanation: The code sets `flag` to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` remains 2, `x` remains an integer, `flag` changes to 1, and the values of `s[1]`, `s[2]` remain '0' and '-1' respectively.
