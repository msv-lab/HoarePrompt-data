Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not always generate an array that satisfies the condition that there does not exist an index \(0 \le i \le n - 2\) such that both \(a_{i} \neq 0\) and \(a_{i + 1} \neq 0\). 

Consider the input \(x = 2\). According to the problem description, a valid array would be \([1, -1]\) because \(1 \cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 = 1 - 2 = -1\), but this does not match the form \(x = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_i \cdot 2^i\) for \(x = 2\).

However, the program generates the array \([1, 0, 0, ..., 0]\) for \(x = 2\), which is \([1]\). This array does not satisfy the condition that there should not be consecutive non-zero elements. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirement for certain inputs.
