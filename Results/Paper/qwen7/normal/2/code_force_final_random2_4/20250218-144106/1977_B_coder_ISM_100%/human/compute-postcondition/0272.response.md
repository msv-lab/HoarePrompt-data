Output State: **`i` is 2, `flag` remains unchanged, `s[i]` is '0'**.

Explanation: The code `s[i] = '0'` changes the value of `s[i]` from its previous state (which was '1' if `flag` was true and `s[i]` was '0', otherwise it remained '0' or not equal to '1') to '0'. The value of `i` remains 2, and `flag` remains unchanged.
