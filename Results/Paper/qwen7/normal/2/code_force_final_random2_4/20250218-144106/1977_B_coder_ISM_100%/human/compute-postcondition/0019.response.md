Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an integer, and `s` is a list containing '0'**.

Explanation: The code snippet `s.append('0')` appends the string `'0'` to the list `s`. Initially, `s` contains either `'1'` or `'0'` based on the condition involving `x` and \(2^1\). After appending `'0'`, `s` will contain `'0'`. The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged.
