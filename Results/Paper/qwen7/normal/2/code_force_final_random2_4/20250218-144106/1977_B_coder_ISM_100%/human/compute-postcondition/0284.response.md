Output State: **`i` is 29, `flag` is true, and the element `s[30]` is '1'.**

The code `s.append('1')` adds the string `'1'` to the list `s`. Since the initial state indicates that `s[29]` is `'0'`, after appending `'1'`, the length of the list `s` increases by 1, making the new index `30` and the element at this index `'1'`. The values of `i` and `flag` remain unchanged.
