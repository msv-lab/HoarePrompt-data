Output State: **`i` is 29, `x` is an input integer, `flag` is 1, `s[0]` to `s[28]` are all '1', `s[29]` is '1', `nalla` is 30, `t` must be greater than or equal to 30**.

Explanation: The code `x = int(input())` assigns the value entered by the user (converted to an integer) to the variable `x`. The values of `i`, `flag`, `s[0]` to `s[29]`, `nalla`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.
