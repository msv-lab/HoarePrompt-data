Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(30)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 29.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than 30.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` should be 30.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

- `i` is 30.

Since there are no other variables in the loop head, no other adjustments are needed.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 30**
