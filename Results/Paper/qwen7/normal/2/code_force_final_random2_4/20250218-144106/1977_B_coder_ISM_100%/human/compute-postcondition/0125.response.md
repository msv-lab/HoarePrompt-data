Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is 29, `x` is an input integer, `flag` is 1, `nalla` is 30, `t` is greater than or equal to 30, `s` is a list of length 30.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all 30 iterations, the variable `i` will have the value 29 because the `range(30)` function generates numbers from 0 to 29. The list `s` will contain 30 elements, each being either '1' or '0', depending on whether the corresponding bit in the integer `x` is set or not. The bits are checked from the least significant bit (bit 0) to the most significant bit (bit 29). The other variables (`flag`, `nalla`, and `t`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
