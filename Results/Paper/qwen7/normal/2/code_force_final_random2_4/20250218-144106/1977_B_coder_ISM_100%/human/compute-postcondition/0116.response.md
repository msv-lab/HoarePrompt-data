Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `flag` is 1, `nalla` is 30, `t` is greater than or equal to 30, `s` is a list of length 31 with the last element being '1'**.

The code `s.append('1')` adds the string `'1'` to the end of the list `s`. Since `s` originally had a length of 30, after appending `'1'`, its length becomes 31. All other variables remain unchanged.
