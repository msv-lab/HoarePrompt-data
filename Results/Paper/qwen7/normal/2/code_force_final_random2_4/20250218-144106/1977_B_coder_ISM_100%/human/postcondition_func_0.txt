The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4. For each test case, it takes an integer `x` between 1 and 2^30 - 1. It converts `x` into a binary representation of 30 bits and then modifies this binary representation according to specific rules. The function outputs the length of the modified binary sequence and the sequence itself. The final state of the program includes printing the length and the modified binary sequence for each test case.
