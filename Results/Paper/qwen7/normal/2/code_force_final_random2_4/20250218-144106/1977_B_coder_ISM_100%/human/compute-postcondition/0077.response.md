Output State: **`i` is 28, `x` is an integer, `flag` is 1, `s[0]` to `s[28]` are all '1', and `s[29]` is '0'.**

The code `s[29] = '0'` changes the value of `s[29]` from '0' to '0', which means it remains unchanged. All other variables (`i`, `x`, `flag`, and the elements of `s` from index 0 to 28) remain in their original states.
