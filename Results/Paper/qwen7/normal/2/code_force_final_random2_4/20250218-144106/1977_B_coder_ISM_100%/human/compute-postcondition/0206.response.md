Output State: **`i` is 29, `length` is 30, `s[29]` is '0', `nalla` is 30, `x` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `x` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it will take an integer input from the user. The values of `i`, `length`, `s[29]`, and `nalla` remain unchanged from their initial states.
