Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `flag` is 1, `nalla` is 30, `t` is greater than or equal to 30, `s` is a list of length 31 with the last element being '0'**

Explanation: The code `s.append('0')` adds the string `'0'` to the end of the list `s`. Initially, `s` has a length of 30. After appending `'0'`, the length of `s` becomes 31, and the last element of `s` is `'0'`. All other variables remain unchanged.
