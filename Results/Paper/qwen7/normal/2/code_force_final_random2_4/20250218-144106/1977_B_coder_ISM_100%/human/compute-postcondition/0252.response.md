Postcondition: `i` is between 0 and 28 (inclusive), `flag` is either true or false, `s[i]` is either '0' or not equal to '1', and `s[i + 1]` is not necessarily equal to `s[i]`. If `flag` is true, then `s[i]` is '0'. Otherwise, no change is made to `flag` and `s[i]` remains as either '0' or not equal to '1'.
