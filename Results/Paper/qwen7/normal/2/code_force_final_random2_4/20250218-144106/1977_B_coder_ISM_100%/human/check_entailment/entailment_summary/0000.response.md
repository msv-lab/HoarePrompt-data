Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it converts the integer `x` into a binary representation of 30 bits using bitwise operations.
3. The program then iterates through the binary representation and applies the specified rules:
   - If `flag` is set and the current bit is '0', it changes the current bit to '1'.
   - If `flag` is not set and the current bit and the next bit are both '1', it changes the current bit to '-1' and sets `flag` to 1.
   - If `flag` is set, it changes the current bit to '0'.
4. After processing the binary representation, it handles the last bit and appends a '1' if necessary to ensure the conditions are met.
5. Finally, it prints the length of the modified binary sequence and the sequence itself.

Given the problem constraints and the provided execution summary, the program appears to follow the required logic and should produce the correct output for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
