Output State: **The variable `i` is 30, `length` is still 30, `s` is a list of 30 elements, and `nalla` is still 30. Each element in `s` is either '1' or '0' based on whether `x & pow(2, i)` is true or false for each `i` from 0 to 29.**

In more detail, after the loop completes all 30 iterations, `i` will have incremented to 30 (though it's not used within the loop), and `length` and `nalla` will remain unchanged at 30. The list `s` will contain 30 elements, where each element is '1' if `x` has the corresponding bit set (i.e., `x & pow(2, i)` is true) and '0' otherwise, for `i` ranging from 0 to 29.
