Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `i` is 0, `s` is the string input by the user and its length must be at least 3, `count` is 3, `flag` is True, `j` is 3. If `s[j]` (which is `s[3]`) is '0' and `s[j + 1]` (which is `s[4]`) is '1', then `j` remains 3. Otherwise, the values of the variables do not change.
