Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the code is flawed and does not accurately determine the minimum number of pieces required to sort the binary string.

Here's why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Counting Cuts**: The variable `count` is incremented every time there is a change in consecutive characters (`s[j] != s[j + 1]`). This approach overcounts the number of cuts needed because it doesn't account for the fact that a single cut can separate multiple segments of zeros and ones.

2. **Flag Handling**: The flag `flag` is set to `True` when a '0' is followed by a '1'. However, this flag is not used correctly to adjust the count of pieces. The logic to decrement `count` when `flag` is `True` is misplaced and does not handle all edge cases.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we should:
- Traverse the string and count the number of transitions from '0' to '1'.
- Each transition indicates a potential cut point.
- If there are no transitions, the string is already sorted, and only one piece is needed.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        for j in range(len(s) - 1):
            if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                count += 1
        # If there are no transitions, the string is already sorted
        if count == 0:
            count = 1
        print(count)
```

This corrected function will correctly determine the minimum number of pieces needed to sort the binary string.
