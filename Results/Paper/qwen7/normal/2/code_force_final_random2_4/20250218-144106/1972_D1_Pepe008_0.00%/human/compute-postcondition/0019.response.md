Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `b` is `b`, `x` is `(a - (i + 2) * (i + 2)) // (i + 2)`, `suma` is `suma + x`.**

Explanation: The code `suma += x` updates the value of `suma` by adding `x` to its current value. However, the value of `x` is defined as `(a - (i + 2) * (i + 2)) // (i + 2)`, which means the value of `x` depends on the current values of `a` and `i`. Since these values are not specified, we keep them as they are. The variables `b` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `suma` which is the old value of `suma` plus `x`.
