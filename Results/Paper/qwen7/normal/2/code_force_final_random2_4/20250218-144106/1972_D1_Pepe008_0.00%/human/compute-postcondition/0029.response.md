Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range `range(1, b + 1)`.

2. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - The variable `i` will take values from 1 to `b` inclusive during the loop execution.
   - The value of `b` is derived from the `info` list, specifically the second element after converting it to an integer.

3. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `t` is 1.
   - `T` remains as the initial positive integer.
   - `info` is a list of strings split from the input.
   - `a` is the first element of `info` converted to an integer.
   - `b` is the second element of `info` converted to an integer.
   - `suma` is 0.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since the loop will iterate over `i` from 1 to `b`, the value of `b` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.
   - The value of `i` will start at 1 and increment until it reaches `b`.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `b` to ensure the loop can execute. Specifically, `b` must be at least 1.

**State:**
**`t` is 1, `T` remains as the initial positive integer, `info` is a list of strings split from the input, `a` is the first element of `info` converted to an integer, `b` must be at least 1, `suma` is 0.**
