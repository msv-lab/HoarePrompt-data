Output State: **`i` is `(i + 1) + 1`, `b` is `b`, `x` is `(a - ((i + 1) + 1) * ((i + 1))) // (((i + 1) + 1))`, `suma` is `suma + x`**.

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `(i + 1) + 1`. The variable `b` remains unchanged. The variable `x` is recalculated as `(a - ((i + 1) + 1) * ((i + 1))) // (((i + 1) + 1))`. Finally, `suma` is updated by adding `x` to its current value.
