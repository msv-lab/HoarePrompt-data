### Reasoning

The original assessment concluded that the program does not correctly implement the required condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\). Let's re-evaluate the program and the given problem statement to ensure our understanding is correct.

#### Problem Statement Recap
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Program Analysis
The program reads the number of test cases \(T\) and then for each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\). It then iterates over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\) and calculates a value \(x\) for each \(i\) in the range 1 to \(b\). The value \(x\) is calculated as:
\[ x = \left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1 \]
If \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\), it adds \(x\) to `suma`. Finally, it prints `suma - 1`.

#### Key Issues
1. **Incorrect Condition Check**: The program does not directly check the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\). Instead, it uses a different formula that does not guarantee the correct count of valid pairs.
2. **Formula Derivation**: The formula \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\) does not seem to directly relate to the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).

#### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if they satisfy the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\). Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        suma = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma)
```

This corrected program directly checks the condition for each pair \((a, b)\) and increments the count if the condition is satisfied.

### Conclusion
The original program does not correctly implement the required condition, and the provided solution uses a different approach that does not guarantee the correct count of valid pairs.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
