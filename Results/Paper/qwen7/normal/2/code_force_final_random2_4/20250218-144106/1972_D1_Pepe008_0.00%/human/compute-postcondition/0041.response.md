Output State: **`x` is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`, `i` is `b + 1`, `b` remains the same**.

Explanation: The code updates `x` to `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`, where `i` is now `b + 1`. The original condition `a - b * (b - 1) > 0` does not affect the new value of `x` since `x` is reassigned directly by the equation. The value of `b` remains unchanged, and `i` is updated to `b + 1`.
