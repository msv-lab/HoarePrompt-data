Output State: The value of `t` is equal to `T-1`, `T` remains as the initial positive integer, `info` remains as the list of strings split from the input, `a` remains as the first element of `info` converted to an integer, `b` remains as the second element of `info` converted to an integer, and `suma` is the sum of all `x` values calculated during the loop iterations for each `t` in the range `T`. This sum is calculated based on the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` for all `i` in the range 1 to `b`, and it continues until `a - i * (i - 1) <= 0` for all `i` in the range 1 to `b`. Finally, `suma` is printed with 1 subtracted from its value.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all iterations, the variable `t` will be one less than the initial value of `T`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The other variables (`info`, `a`, `b`, and `suma`) will retain their final values after the last iteration of the loop, which is the sum of all `x` values calculated during the loop iterations for each `t` from 0 to `T-1`, with 1 subtracted from the final `suma` value before printing.
