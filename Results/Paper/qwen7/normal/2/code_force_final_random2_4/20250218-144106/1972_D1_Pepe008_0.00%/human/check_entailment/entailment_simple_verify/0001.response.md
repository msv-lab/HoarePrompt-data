### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Loop Over Test Cases**:
   - It iterates over each test case.
   - For each pair `(a, b)`, it initializes a variable `suma` to store the count of valid pairs.

3. **Calculation of Valid Pairs**:
   - The inner loop runs from `1` to `b`.
   - For each value of `i` in this range, it calculates `x` using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
   - If `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than `0`, it adds `x` to `suma`.
   - Finally, it prints `suma - 1`.

### Key Points to Check

1. **Formula Analysis**:
   - The formula used in the program is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
   - This formula is derived from a different logic and does not directly relate to the condition `a + b % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0`.

2. **Condition Verification**:
   - The condition `a + b` should be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The program does not directly check this condition. Instead, it uses a different approach which might not be equivalent.

3. **Correctness of the Approach**:
   - The given solution appears to use a different method to count the pairs, which might not be accurate.
   - The formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` does not seem to directly relate to the condition `a + b % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0`.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotations

- **Initial State**: `T` is read as the number of test cases.
- **Test Case Loop**: For each test case, `a` and `b` are read.
- **Inner Loop**: The loop runs from `1` to `b`.
  - `x` is calculated using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
  - If `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, `x` is added to `suma`.
- **Output**: `suma - 1` is printed.

### Correctness Check

- **Formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`**:
  - This formula does not directly correspond to the condition `a + b % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0`.
  - The formula seems to be an attempt to count something related to the divisors of `a` and `b`, but it does not ensure that the condition is met.

- **Example Analysis**:
  - In the example provided, the correct output is given for each test case.
  - However, the program's logic does not match the expected behavior based on the problem statement.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly implement the required condition `a + b % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0`. The provided solution uses a different approach that does not guarantee the correct count of valid pairs.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
