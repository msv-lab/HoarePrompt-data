Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `b`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `b + 1`.

3. **Analyze the postcondition**:
   - `i` is updated to `(i + 1) + 1`.
   - `b` remains unchanged.
   - `x` is calculated as `(a - ((i + 1) + 1) * ((i + 1))) // (((i + 1) + 1))`.
   - `suma` is updated by adding `x` to it if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`. Otherwise, `suma` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the new state**:
   - Since the loop updates `i` to `(i + 1) + 1`, the new value of `i` will be `i + 2`.
   - `b` remains the same.
   - `x` is recalculated based on the new `i` value.
   - `suma` is updated if the condition `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` holds true. Otherwise, `suma` remains unchanged.

Given the postcondition, let's assume the following values at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is some value, say `i_prev`.
- `b` is some value, say `b_prev`.
- `suma` is some value, say `suma_prev`.
- `a` is some value, say `a_prev`.

At the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be `i_prev + 2`.
- `b` remains `b_prev`.
- `x` will be recalculated as `(a_prev - ((i_prev + 2) + 1) * ((i_prev + 2))) // (((i_prev + 2) + 1))`.
- `suma` will be updated if `a_prev - (i_prev + 2) * (i_prev + 1) > 0`.

Since we don't have specific values for `i_prev`, `b_prev`, `suma_prev`, and `a_prev`, we can generalize the answer as follows:

**State:**
- `i` is `(i + 1) + 1` (which is `i + 2`).
- `b` is `b`.
- `x` is `(a - ((i + 1) + 1) * ((i + 1))) // (((i + 1) + 1))` (which is `(a - (i + 2) * (i + 2)) // (i + 2)`).
- `suma` is `suma + x` if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`. Otherwise, `suma` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the final state is:

State: **`i` is `(i + 1) + 1`, `b` is `b`, `x` is `(a - ((i + 1) + 1) * ((i + 1))) // (((i + 1) + 1))`, and `suma` is `suma + x` if `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`. Otherwise, `i` is `(i + 1) + 1`, `b` is `b`, `x` is `(a - ((i + 1) + 1) * ((i + 1))) // (((i + 1) + 1))`, and `suma` remains unchanged.**
