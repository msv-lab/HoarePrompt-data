Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Loop Over Test Cases**:
   - It iterates over each test case.
   - For each pair `(a, b)`, it initializes a variable `suma` to store the count of valid pairs.

3. **Calculation of Valid Pairs**:
   - The inner loop runs from `1` to `b`.
   - For each value of `i` in this range, it calculates `x` using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
   - If `a - i * (i - 1)` is greater than `0`, it adds `x` to `suma`.
   - Finally, it prints `suma - 1`.

### Key Points to Check

1. **Formula Analysis**:
   - The formula used in the program is `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`.
   - This formula seems to be derived from a specific logic, but let's check if it correctly counts the valid pairs.

2. **Condition Verification**:
   - The condition `a + b` should be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The program does not directly check this condition. Instead, it uses a different approach which might not be equivalent.

3. **Correctness of the Approach**:
   - The given solution appears to use a different method to count the pairs, which might not be accurate.
   - The formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` does not seem to directly relate to the condition `a + b % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0`.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program does not correctly implement the required condition `a + b % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0`. The provided solution uses a different approach that does not guarantee the correct count of valid pairs.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
