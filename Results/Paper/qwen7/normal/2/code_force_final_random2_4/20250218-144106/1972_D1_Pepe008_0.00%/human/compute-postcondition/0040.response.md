Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, b + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `b`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `b`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is an integer.
   - If `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`, then `x` is updated to `x + 1`. Otherwise, `x` remains unchanged.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `b`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `b + 1`.
   - The value of `b` does not change within the loop, so `b` remains the same.
   - The value of `x` depends on the condition `a - i * (i - 1) > 0`. Since `i` was `b` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to check if `a - b * (b - 1) > 0` to determine if `x` is updated.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `i` will be `b + 1`.
   - `b` remains the same.
   - `x` will either be `x + 1` if `a - b * (b - 1) > 0` or remain unchanged otherwise.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`x` is an integer, if `a - b * (b - 1) > 0`, then `x` is updated to `x + 1`, otherwise `x` remains unchanged, `i` is `b + 1`, `b` remains the same**.
