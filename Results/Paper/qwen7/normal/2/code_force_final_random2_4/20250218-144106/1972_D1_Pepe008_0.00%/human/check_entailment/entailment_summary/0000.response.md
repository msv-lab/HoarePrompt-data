Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem but contains several issues that make it incorrect. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Inner Loop Range**: The inner loop in the provided code snippet has `range(4, b+1)`, which is not aligned with the problem statement. The problem requires checking all possible values of `a` from 1 to `n` and `b` from 1 to `m`.

2. **Incorrect Formula for `x`**: The formula used to calculate `x` is incorrect. The formula `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` does not correctly implement the logic required to count valid pairs `(a, b)`.

3. **Misunderstanding of Conditions**: The problem requires checking if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The current implementation does not properly check this condition.

4. **Unnecessary Commented Code**: There is commented-out code that attempts to directly check the condition using `math.gcd`, but the main logic still uses an incorrect approach.

Given these issues, the provided solution does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
