Output State: **i is equal to b, suma is the sum of integers starting from 2 up to the value of x in the last iteration of the loop, and all conditions for the loop to execute must hold true.**

To elaborate, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `b`. The variable `suma` will be the cumulative sum of the values of `x` calculated in each iteration of the loop. The value of `x` in each iteration is determined by the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`, where `i` starts from 1 and increases by 1 until it reaches `b`. The sum `suma` accumulates these values of `x` as long as `a - i * (i - 1) > 0` holds true for each `i`. If the condition fails for any `i`, the value of `suma` remains unchanged from the previous valid iteration.
