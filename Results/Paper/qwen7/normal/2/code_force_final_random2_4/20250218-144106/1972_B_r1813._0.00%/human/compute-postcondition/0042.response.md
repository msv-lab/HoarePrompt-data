To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given initial state and the print statement:

1. The initial state only contains the print statement itself: `print(result)`
2. There are no other variables or objects defined in the initial state, so `result` must be a predefined variable or object with a known value.

Since the initial state does not provide any explicit value for `result`, we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, the output will simply be the value of `result` as it exists in the program's current state.

Output: **result**
