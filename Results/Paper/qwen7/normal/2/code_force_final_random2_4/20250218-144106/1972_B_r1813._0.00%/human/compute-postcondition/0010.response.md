Output State: **`index` is 5, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is equal to the length of `data[3]`, `s` is equal to `data[3]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `results` is an empty list**

Explanation: The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. Initially, `index` was 4, so after executing the code, `index` becomes 5. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `s`, `data`, and `results`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
