Based on the initial state provided:

- `result` is the next element in `results`.
- `results` must have at least one more element.

Since `result` is explicitly stated to be the next element in `results` and `results` has at least one more element, `result` must be the second element in the `results` list.

Therefore, when the `print(result)` statement is executed, it will print the second element of the `results` list.

Output: **the second element of results**
