Postcondition: **`index` is 5, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is equal to the length of `data[3]`, `s` is equal to `data[3]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `results` is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO', and `num_up_coins` is the number of 'U' in `data[3]`. If `num_up_coins` is odd, `results` contains 'YES'. If `num_up_coins` is even, `results` contains 'NO'.**
