Output State: **`index` is 5, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is equal to the length of `data[3]`, `s` is equal to `data[3]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `results` is a list containing 'YES', `num_up_coins` is the number of 'U' in `data[3]` and the current value of `num_up_coins` is odd.**

Explanation: The line `results.append('YES')` adds the string `'YES'` to the list `results`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
