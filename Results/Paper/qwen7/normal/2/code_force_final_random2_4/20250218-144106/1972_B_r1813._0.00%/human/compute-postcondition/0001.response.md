Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D", `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string.**

The code `data = input().split()` takes an input string from the user and splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace. Since the initial state specifies that `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", the input to `split()` would be `s`. However, the output of `split()` on a single string without any delimiters in between would be the same string as a single-element list. Thus, `data` becomes a list containing the string `s`. All other variables (`t` and `n`) remain unchanged.
