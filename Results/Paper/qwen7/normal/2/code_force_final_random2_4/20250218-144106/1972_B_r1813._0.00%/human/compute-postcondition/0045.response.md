Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `result` and `results`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `results` has at least one more element.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `result` is the next element in `results`.
   - `results` must have at least one more element.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `result` is the next element in `results`, it means `results` had at least one element left after assigning `result`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `results` must have at least two elements (one for the current iteration and one for the next).

5. **Update the state**:
   - `result` will be the next element in `results` after the current one.
   - `results` must have at least two elements.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`result` is the next element in `results`, `results` must have at least two elements**
