Output State: **`a` is the first integer entered by the user, `b` is the second integer entered by the user, `f` is the third integer entered by the user, `sum_f` is equal to `sum_f + f`, `j` is `j + 2`, `m` is the same as before**.

Explanation: The code `sum_f += f` updates the value of `sum_f` by adding `f` to its current value. All other variables (`a`, `b`, `j`, and `m`) remain unchanged. Therefore, `sum_f` is now equal to its previous value plus `f`.
