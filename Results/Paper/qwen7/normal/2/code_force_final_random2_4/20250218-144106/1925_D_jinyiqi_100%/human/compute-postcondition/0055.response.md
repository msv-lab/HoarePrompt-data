Output State: **`a` is the first integer from the input, `b` is the second integer from the input, `f` is the third integer from the input, `sum_f` is equal to `sum_f + f`, `j` is `j_prev + 2`, `m` is the same as it was before.**

Explanation: The code `sum_f += f` adds the value of `f` to `sum_f`. The values of `a`, `b`, `j`, `m`, and the initial state of `f` remain unchanged. The updated value of `sum_f` is the sum of its previous value and the current value of `f`.
