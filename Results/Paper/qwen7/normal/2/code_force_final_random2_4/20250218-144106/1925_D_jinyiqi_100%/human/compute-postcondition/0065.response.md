Output State: All variables outside the loop remain unchanged, including `t`, `M`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `sum_f`, `cn2`, `p`, `q`, and `gcd`. After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `t-1`, and the final values of `p` and `q` will be simplified by their greatest common divisor (`gcd`). The expression `int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M)` will be printed for each iteration, resulting in `t` outputs, each representing the simplified fraction \( \frac{p}{q} \) modulo \( M \).

This means that after all iterations, the loop will have processed all inputs specified by `t`, and for each input set, it will compute and print the result of the expression \( \frac{p}{q} \mod M \), where `p` and `q` are the final values after all iterations, simplified by their greatest common divisor.
