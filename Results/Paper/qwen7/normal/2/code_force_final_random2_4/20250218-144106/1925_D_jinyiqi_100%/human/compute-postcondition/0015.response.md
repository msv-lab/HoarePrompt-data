Output State: All iterations of the loop have completed, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `j` is `m`, `a` is an integer entered by the user for each iteration, `b` is an integer entered by the user for each iteration, `f` is an integer entered by the user for each iteration, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values entered over the `m` iterations.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations (i.e., `j` ranges from 0 to `m-1`), the variable `sum_f` will hold the total sum of all `f` values read from the input. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`) retain their final states from the last iteration of the loop, with `j` being equal to `m-1`.
