Output State: **`a` is an integer entered by the user, `b` is an integer entered by the user, `f` is an integer entered by the user, `sum_f` is equal to `sum_f + f`.**

Explanation: The code `sum_f += f` increments the value of `sum_f` by the value of `f`. Since `f` is an integer entered by the user, `sum_f` now holds the sum of its previous value and `f`. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.
