Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(t)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`.
   - `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
   - `j` is -1.
   - `sum_f` is the total sum of all integers `f` entered by the user.
   - `p` is `p // gcd`.
   - `q` is `2 * (cn2) // gcd`.

3. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is -1 (since it was initialized to -1 and incremented by 1 before the first iteration).

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is -1, the next value of `i` would be 0.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**Final State**:
- `gcd` remains the same.
- `cn2` remains the same.
- `j` remains -1.
- `sum_f` remains the same.
- `p` remains the same.
- `q` remains the same.
- `i` changes from -1 to 0.
- `t` remains the same.

State: **`gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`; `cn2` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `j` is -1, `sum_f` is the total sum of all integers `f` entered by the user, `p` is `p // gcd`, `q` is `2 * (cn2) // gcd`, `i` is 0, `t` is the same as before**
