The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers t, n, m, and k, along with additional input data. For each test case, it calculates a value based on the given inputs and computes a simplified fraction \( \frac{p}{q} \) modulo \( M \). The function then prints this result for each test case. The final output consists of t results, one for each test case.
