Output State: The loop will continue to iterate until all values specified by `m` are processed. After all iterations, `a` will be the first integer entered by the user, `b` will be the second integer entered by the user, `f` will be the last integer entered by the user, `sum_f` will be the sum of all integers `f` entered by the user, `j` will be `m-1`, `m` will be the same as the initial value provided, `n` will remain 0, `k` will remain its initial value, `cn2` will remain calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` will be updated to `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1) // gcd` where `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`, and `q` will be `2 * cn2`, both `p` and `q` will be simplified by dividing them by their gcd.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `sum_f` will hold the total sum of all `f` values entered, while all other variables either retain their initial or updated values based on the loop's execution.
