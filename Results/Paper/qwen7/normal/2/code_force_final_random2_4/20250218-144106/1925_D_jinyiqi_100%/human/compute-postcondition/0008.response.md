Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(m)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `m`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sum_f` is `sum_f + f`
   - `t` must be greater than 0
   - `i` is 0
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces
   - `j` is 0
   - `a`, `b`, and `f` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces
   - `m` must be greater than 0

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 1.
   - The value of `m` remains unchanged as it is determined by the input and does not change within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `sum_f` is `sum_f + f`
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `i` is 0
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces
- `j` is 1
- `a`, `b`, and `f` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces
- `m` must be greater than 0

**Final State:**
State: **`sum_f` is `sum_f + f`, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `j` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `f` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `m` must be greater than 0**
