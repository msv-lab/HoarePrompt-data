Output State: **`j` is `j_prev + 1`, `m` must be greater than or equal to `j_prev + 1`, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `a, b, f = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `f`. The values of `j` and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `j` is still `j_prev + 1` and `m` must still be greater than or equal to `j_prev + 1`. The new variables `a`, `b`, and `f` are assigned the values of the input integers.
