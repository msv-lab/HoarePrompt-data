Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `j` is `m-1`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `f` is an integer, `sum_f` is the sum of all `f` values entered over the `m` iterations, `cn2` is calculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, `p` is `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1) // gcd`, `q` is `2 * cn2`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `p` and `q`, and `p` is updated to `p // gcd`.**

Explanation: The code `p = p // gcd` divides `p` by `gcd` and updates the value of `p`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
