Output State: **`prev` is equal to `x`, `x` is the first element of the list `odds`, `idx` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `idx = idx - 1` decrements the value of `idx` by 1. The values of `prev` and `x` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. The list `odds` also remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the decrement of `idx`.
