The function accepts a list of integers `cts` and processes each element to construct a new list `odds`. For each element `ct` in `cts`, if `ct` matches the last element in `odds`, the last element is removed; otherwise, `ct` is added to `odds`. After processing all elements in `cts`, the function returns the final state of `odds`. If `cts` is empty, the function returns an empty list.
