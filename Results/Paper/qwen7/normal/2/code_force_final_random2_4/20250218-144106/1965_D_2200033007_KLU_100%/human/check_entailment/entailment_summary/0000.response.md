### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify that it correctly recovers a palindrome array \(a\) from the given subarray sums. Let's break down the key parts of the program and their roles:

1. **Reading Input and Sorting Subarray Sums**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It sorts the subarray sums to facilitate the identification of missing sums.

2. **Identifying Missing Sum**:
   - The program uses `func_2` to filter out repeated values, which helps in identifying potential missing sums.
   - Depending on the count of unique values, the program decides how to find the missing sum using either `func_3` or a combination of `func_3`, `func_1`, and `func_4`.

3. **Constructing the Palindrome Array**:
   - The program uses `func_3` to reconstruct the palindrome array based on the filtered subarray sums.
   - The reconstruction logic ensures that the resulting array is a palindrome.

4. **Verification**:
   - The program ensures that the constructed array is a palindrome and prints it.

Let's analyze the correctness of each part:

- **Function `func_1`**: This function generates all possible cumulative sums of subarrays, which is necessary for constructing the palindrome array.
- **Function `func_2`**: This function filters out repeated values, helping to identify the missing sum more accurately.
- **Function `func_3`**: This function reconstructs the palindrome array based on the filtered subarray sums. It correctly handles the symmetry required for a palindrome.
- **Function `func_4`**: This function helps in removing redundant elements when calculating the missing sum.

Given the detailed descriptions and the logical flow of the program, it appears that the program correctly identifies the missing sum and constructs a valid palindrome array.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to recover a palindrome array from the given subarray sums. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
