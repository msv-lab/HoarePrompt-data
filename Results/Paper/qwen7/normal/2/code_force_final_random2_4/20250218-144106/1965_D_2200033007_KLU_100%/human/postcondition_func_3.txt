The function accepts two parameters, `bigList` (a list of integers) and `smallList` (a list of integers). It repeatedly removes the last elements from both lists as long as the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are equal and `smallList` is not empty. Once the conditions are no longer met, it returns the last element of `bigList` before the lists became unequal or `smallList` became empty. If `bigList` becomes empty during the process, the function returns the last remaining element in `bigList`.
