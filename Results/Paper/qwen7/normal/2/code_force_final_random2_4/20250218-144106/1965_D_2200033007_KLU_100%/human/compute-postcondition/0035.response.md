Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `j` and `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `j < len(a)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` must be less than `len(a)`
   - `j` is equal to `i`
   - `sm` is updated by adding `a[j]` to it
   - `cts` is appended with `sm`

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `j` starts from `i` and increments within the loop, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must still be less than `len(a)`. Hence, `i + 1` must be less than `len(a)`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` remains the same (since it is not modified in the loop).
   - `j` becomes `i + 1`.
   - `sm` is updated by adding `a[j]` to it, so `sm` becomes `sm + a[i + 1]`.
   - `cts` is appended with `sm`, so `cts` becomes `cts + [sm + a[i + 1]]`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` must be less than `len(a)`, `j` is `i + 1`, `sm` is `sm + a[i + 1]`, `cts` is `cts + [sm + a[i + 1]]`**.
