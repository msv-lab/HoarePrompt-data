Output State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with the last element removed, and `smallList` is a list of integers representing all but one of the subarray sums of a palindrome array `a`, with `len(smallList) > 0` and `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`**.

Explanation: The code `bigList.pop()` removes the last element from the `bigList`. The `smallList` remains unchanged as the operation only affects `bigList`. The condition that `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]` still holds true after the operation.
