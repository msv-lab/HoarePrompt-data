Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and the range condition involving `i` and `len(a)`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `j` is within the range from `i` to `len(a)`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `i + 1`.

3. **Determine the next value of `j`**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `j` will be `i + 2`.

4. **Check the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j < len(a)`. Since `j` is now `i + 2`, the loop will continue if `i + 2 < len(a)`.

5. **Adjust the other states**: The other states (`i`, `sm`, and `cts`) do not change within the loop head and are not directly affected by the loop condition or the increment of `j`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `j` should be `i + 2`.
- The loop will continue as long as `i + 2 < len(a)`.

So, the updated state is:

**State: `i` must be less than `len(a)`, `j` is `i + 2`, `sm` is `sm + a[i + 1] + a[j]`, `cts` is `cts + [sm + a[i + 1]]`, `cts` is `cts + [sm]`**
