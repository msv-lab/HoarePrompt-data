Output State: **`sm` will hold the sum of all elements in the list `a`, and `cts` will be a list containing all possible cumulative sums of subarrays ending at each index from 0 to len(`a`) - 1.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `sm` will contain the total sum of all elements in the list `a`. The list `cts` will include every possible sum of subarrays that can be formed by adding consecutive elements from the start of the list up to each index. This means `cts` will contain the cumulative sums of all subarrays starting from the first element up to each subsequent element in the list `a`.
