Output State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with its last element removed, `smallList` must have at least one element, and the last element of `smallList` is no longer equal to the last element of `bigList`.**

Explanation: The code `smallList.pop()` removes the last element from `smallList`. Since the initial state had `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`, after executing the code, this equality no longer holds. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
