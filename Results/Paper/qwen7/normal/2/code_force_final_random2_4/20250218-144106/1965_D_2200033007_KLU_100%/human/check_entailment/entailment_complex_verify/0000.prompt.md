You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of n positive integers. You know that a is a
palindrome, or in other words, for all 1 \le i \le n , a_i = a_{n + 1 - i} .
You are given the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays, in arbitrary
order. The subarray whose sum is not given can be any of the \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
distinct subarrays of a .

Recover any possible palindrome a . The input is chosen such that there is
always at least one array a that satisfies the conditions.

An array b is a subarray of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion of
several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several
(possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 200 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 1000
) — the size of the array a .

The next line of each test case contains \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 integers s_i
(1\leq s_i \leq 10^9 ) — all but one of the subarray sums of a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 1000 .

Additional constraint on the input: There is always at least one valid
solution.

Hacks are disabled for this problem.

Output

For each test case, print one line containing n positive integers a_1, a_2,
\cdots a_n — any valid array a . Note that a must be a palindrome.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

    500000000 500000000 500000000 
    
Note

For the first example case, the subarrays of a = [1, 2, 1] are:

  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [2] with sum 2 , 
  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [1, 2] with sum 3 , 
  * [2, 1] with sum 3 , 
  * [1, 2, 1] with sum 4 . 

So the full list of subarray sums is 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4 , and the sum that is
missing from the input list is 3 .

For the second example case, the missing subarray sum is 4 , for the subarray
[2, 2] .

For the third example case, the missing subarray sum is 13 , because there are
two subarrays with sum 13 ([3, 5, 5] and [5, 5, 3] ) but 13 only occurs once
in the input.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers representing the subarray sums of a palindrome array, where 1 ≤ len(a) < 1000 and 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < len(a).

    #The program returns a list `cts` which contains all possible cumulative sums of subarrays ending at each index from 0 to len(`a`) - 1, and this list is sorted.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `a` of integers and returns a sorted list `cts` containing all possible cumulative sums of subarrays ending at each index from 0 to the length of `a` - 1.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: cts is a list of integers representing all but one of the distinct subarray sums of a palindrome array a. Each element in cts is an integer within the range 1 ≤ s_i ≤ 10^9.

            odds.append(ct)
        
    #State: Output State: The final state of `odds` is a list that contains elements derived from the process described in the loop. Specifically, `odds` will contain elements that are either the previous element minus one (if the current `ct` matches the last element of `odds`), or the current `ct` itself (if it does not match). The exact contents of `odds` depend on the sequence of elements in `cts`.
    #
    #In more detail, `odds` will be constructed such that each element is either the previous element minus one if `ct` equals the last element of `odds`, or the current `ct` if it does not. This process continues until all elements in `cts` have been processed. The final `odds` list will thus reflect the cumulative effect of these operations over all iterations of the loop.
    #
    #The variable `cts` will be empty after all iterations of the loop have completed, as each element of `cts` is consumed during each iteration. The variable `ct` will be the last element of `cts` that was processed, but since `cts` is empty at the end, `ct` is effectively undefined in the context of the final state.
    return odds
    #The program returns an empty list for `odds` since `cts` is empty and no elements are processed in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `cts` and processes each element to construct a new list `odds`. For each element `ct` in `cts`, if `ct` matches the last element in `odds`, the last element is removed; otherwise, `ct` is added to `odds`. After processing all elements in `cts`, the function returns the final state of `odds`. If `cts` is empty, the function returns an empty list.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: odds is a list of integers representing the subarray sums of the palindrome array a, excluding one sum. n is an integer representing the size of the array a, and it is guaranteed that 3 <= n <= 1000 and n is odd.

    return a
    #The program returns the list 'a', which contains values based on the list 'odds', and 'idx' is -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `odds` containing integers representing subarray sums of an array `a`, and an integer `n` representing the size of `a`. It constructs and returns the array `a` based on the values in `odds`. After processing, it sets `idx` to -1.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: bigList is a list of integers representing the complete set of subarray sums, and smallList is a list of integers representing all but one of the subarray sums of a palindrome array a. The elements in both lists are positive integers.
def func_4(bigList, smallList):
    while len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]:
        bigList.pop()
        
        smallList.pop()
        
    #State: Output State: `bigList` is an empty list, and `smallList` is an empty list.
    #
    #Explanation: After each iteration of the loop, both `bigList` and `smallList` have their last elements removed. Since the loop continues as long as `len(smallList) > 0` and `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`, once these conditions are no longer met or `smallList` becomes empty, the loop stops. Therefore, after all iterations, both lists will be empty.
    return bigList[-1]
    #The program returns an element from bigList which would be the last element before the lists became unequal or smallList became empty.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `bigList` (a list of integers) and `smallList` (a list of integers). It repeatedly removes the last elements from both lists as long as the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are equal and `smallList` is not empty. Once the conditions are no longer met, it returns the last element of `bigList` before the lists became unequal or `smallList` became empty. If `bigList` becomes empty during the process, the function returns the last remaining element in `bigList`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` do not seem to address the core requirement of recovering a palindrome array from the given subarray sums. Instead, they appear to be generating and processing subarray sums, which is not directly related to solving the problem.

To illustrate, let's consider a simple example:

- Input: `n = 3`, subarray sums excluding one: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 1]`

The correct palindrome array for this input should be `[1, 2, 1]`. However, the provided functions do not generate this array. They instead focus on processing the subarray sums, which does not lead to the recovery of the palindrome array.

Specifically, the function `func_4` is not used in the solution and seems unnecessary. The main issue is that none of the functions actually implement the logic to recover the palindrome array from the given subarray sums.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is thus incorrect.
