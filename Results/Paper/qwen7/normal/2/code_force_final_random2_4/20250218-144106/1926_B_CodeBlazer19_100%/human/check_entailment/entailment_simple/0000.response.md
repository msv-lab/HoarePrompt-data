### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining whether a given grid contains a triangle or a square made up of '1's.
2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid (`n`) and the grid itself.
   - It checks each row to see if it contains exactly one '1' (indicating a potential triangle) or more than one '1' (indicating a potential square).
   - If any row has exactly one '1', it sets `a` to 'TRIANGLE'.
   - If any row has more than one '1', it sets `b` to 'SQUARE'.
   - After processing all rows, it prints the value of `a` if it was set, otherwise it prints the value of `b`.

3. **Issues Identified**:
   - The logic to identify a triangle or square is flawed. Specifically, setting `a` to 'TRIANGLE' and `b` to 'SQUARE' after checking a single row is insufficient. 
   - The code does not check if the entire grid forms a triangle or square.
   - The state comments indicate that `a` will only be set if a row has exactly one '1', but this does not guarantee the entire grid is a triangle.
   - Similarly, setting `b` to 'SQUARE' after finding a row with more than one '1' is also insufficient without further validation.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly determine whether the grid forms a triangle or a square. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
