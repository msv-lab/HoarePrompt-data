Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0, `b` is 'SQUARE', `j` is 2, `s` is the input string from the user, `s` is an input string, `b` is 'SQUARE'**

Explanation: The code snippet `b = 'SQUARE'` does not change the value of `b`. It simply reassigns the value of `b` to 'SQUARE', which was already its value before the assignment. All other variables remain unchanged.
