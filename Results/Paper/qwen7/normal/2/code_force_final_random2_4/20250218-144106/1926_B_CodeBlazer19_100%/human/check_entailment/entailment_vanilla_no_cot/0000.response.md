Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly identify whether the shape is a triangle or a square. Here's why:

1. **Triangle Identification**: The program checks if any row contains exactly one '1'. If so, it assumes the shape is a triangle. However, this is not sufficient because a triangle can have more than one row with '1's, and these rows should be centered around the middle column.

2. **Square Identification**: The program checks if every row contains more than one '1' and counts them. If so, it assumes the shape is a square. This is also insufficient because it doesn't verify the uniform distance of '1's from the left edge.

To fix this, the program needs to check the structure of the grid more carefully to ensure it matches the definitions of a triangle or a square.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_triangle(grid):
    n = len(grid)
    for i in range(1, n):
        if grid[i].count('1') != 2 * i + 1:
            return False
        if grid[i][n // 2] != '1':
            return False
    return True

def is_square(grid):
    n = len(grid)
    for i in range(1, n):
        if grid[i].count('1') != n:
            return False
        if abs(grid[i].index('1') - n // 2) != i:
            return False
    return True

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input() for _ in range(n)]
        
        if is_triangle(grid):
            print("TRIANGLE")
        elif is_square(grid):
            print("SQUARE")
        else:
            print("UNKNOWN")

func()
```

This corrected version checks the grid to see if it matches the structure of a triangle or a square according to the given definitions.
