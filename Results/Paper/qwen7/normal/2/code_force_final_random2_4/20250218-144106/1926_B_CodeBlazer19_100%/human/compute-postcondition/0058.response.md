Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or 0, `b` is either an empty string or 'SQUARE', `j` is 1, `s` is the input string from the user.**

Explanation: The code `s = input()` takes an input string from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `j`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition on `s` depends on the value of `a`: if `a` is 'TRIANGLE', then `s` must contain exactly one '1'; otherwise, `s` must contain more than one '1'. However, since the input operation does not alter these conditions, they are preserved in the output state.
