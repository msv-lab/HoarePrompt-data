Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or remains 0, `b` is 'SQUARE', `s` is the updated input string. If the count of '1' in the string `s` is exactly 1, `s` is updated to the new input string. If the count of '1' in the string `s` is greater than 1, `s` is updated accordingly. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.
