Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n + 2`, `a` is 0, `b` is 'SQUARE', `j` is 3, `s` is the final input string from the user, `n` is an integer input by the user**.

The value of `a` is explicitly set to 0, which changes its previous value. All other variables retain their initial conditions.
