Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is set to `n + 1`.
- `a` is the string 'TRIANGLE'.
- `b` is the string 'SQUARE'.
- `j` is 3.
- `s` is the final input string from the user.
- `a` remains 'TRIANGLE' because the input string `s` does not contain exactly one '1'.

The `print(b)` statement will print the value of `b`.

Output: **SQUARE**
