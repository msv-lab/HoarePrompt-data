Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is either 'TRIANGLE' or remains 0, `b` is 'SQUARE', and `s` is the final input string after all iterations, `n` is the new input integer from user input.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 and the value of `i` being `n + 1` (where `n` was initially defined) are still valid.
