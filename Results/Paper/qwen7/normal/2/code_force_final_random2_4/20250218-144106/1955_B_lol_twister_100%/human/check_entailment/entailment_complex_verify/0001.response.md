### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness, using the provided annotations and the original assessment.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n`, `c`, `d`, and the list `l` of integers.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes `n`, `c`, `d`, and `l` as arguments.
   - It calculates the minimum value in the list `l` and stores it in `a`.
   - It then constructs a list `li` where each element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for all possible pairs `(k, h)` within the range `[0, n-1]`.
   - The list `li` is sorted.
   - The input list `l` is also sorted.
   - Finally, it checks if the sorted list `l` matches the sorted list `li`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic of constructing the progressive square is correct. Given `a_{1,1} = a`, `c`, and `d`, the value at position `(k, h)` in the progressive square is `a + k * c + d * h`.
   - Sorting both lists before comparison ensures that the order of elements is checked correctly.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the construction and sorting of the lists correctly.
   - It checks if the sorted list `l` matches the generated list `li`, which should contain all elements of the progressive square in sorted order.

5. **Output:**
   - The function returns `'yes'` if the lists match, otherwise `'no'`.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotations:

- **Initial State:**
  - `n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 500`.
  - `c` and `d` are integers such that `1 <= c, d <= 10^6`.
  - `l` is a list of `n^2` integers where each integer is in the range `[1, 10^9]`.

- **After Reading Input:**
  - `a` is set to the minimum value in `l`.
  - `li` is constructed by iterating over all pairs `(k, h)` and appending `a + k * c + d * h` to `li`.
  - Both `li` and `l` are sorted.

- **Final State:**
  - The function checks if `l` is equal to `li`.
  - If `l` equals `li`, it returns `'yes'`.
  - Otherwise, it returns `'no'`.

### Correctness Verification:

- **Constructing `li`:**
  - The construction of `li` is based on the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for all pairs `(k, h)` in the range `[0, n-1]`.
  - This correctly generates the sequence of numbers that would appear in the progressive square starting from `a`.

- **Sorting and Comparison:**
  - Sorting both `li` and `l` ensures that the order of elements is checked correctly.
  - If `l` matches `li`, it means the elements in `l` can indeed form the progressive square.

### Edge Cases:

- **Minimum Value Calculation:**
  - The minimum value `a` is correctly identified and used to generate the sequence.

- **Range Check:**
  - The ranges for `n`, `c`, `d`, and the values in `l` are correctly handled.

- **Sorting:**
  - The sorting operation is applied correctly to both lists.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to check if the provided list `l` can form a progressive square with the given parameters `n`, `c`, and `d`. The steps are logically sound and handle the required operations accurately.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
