Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` correctly identifies the minimum value `a` in the list `l`.
2. It then generates a new list `li` by calculating values using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for all possible indices `(k, h)` within the range `[0, n-1]`.
3. Both `li` and `l` are sorted before comparison.
4. The comparison ensures that the generated list `li` matches the original list `l` exactly, which is a necessary condition for the given problem.
5. The logic and implementation in the function `func_1` align with the problem description and the provided examples.

Given the above points, the function `func_1` appears to be correctly implemented and should produce the expected results based on the problem statement and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
