Output State: `k` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `h` is n-1, `li` is a list containing the values [a, a + d, a + 2d, ..., a + (n-1)d].

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `h` will take the value `n-1` since the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`. The list `li` will contain `n` elements, each calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for `h` ranging from `0` to `n-1`. Given that `k` remains `0` throughout the loop, the expression simplifies to `a + d * h`, resulting in the sequence `[a, a + d, a + 2d, ..., a + (n-1)d]`.
