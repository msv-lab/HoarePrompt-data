Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for h in range(0, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `h` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `li` is a list with one element which is `a + k * c + d * 0`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `h < n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `h` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, after the first iteration, `h` will be 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `h` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `h` should be 1 and `n` must still be greater than 1 (since `h` is now 1).

5. **Update the state**:
   - The value of `li` does not change within the loop head, so it remains the same.
   - The value of `h` changes to 1.
   - The value of `n` must still be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`li` is a list with one element which is `a + k * c + d * 0`, `h` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
