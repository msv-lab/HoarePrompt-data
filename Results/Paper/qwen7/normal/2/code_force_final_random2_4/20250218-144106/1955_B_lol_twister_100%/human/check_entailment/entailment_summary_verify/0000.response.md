### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function `func_1` correctly generates a list `li` by iterating through all possible positions in an \(n \times n\) grid and calculating the corresponding value based on the formula \(a + k \cdot c + d \cdot h\).
- It then sorts both `li` and the input list `l`.
- Finally, it checks if the sorted lists are equal and returns 'yes' or 'no' accordingly.

#### Program Code Analysis:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `c`, `d`, and the list `l`.
- It calls the function `func_1` with these parameters and prints the result.

#### Correctness of the Program:
- The program correctly generates the expected values for the progressive square based on the given `c` and `d`.
- It sorts both the generated list `li` and the input list `l` before comparing them.
- The comparison ensures that the input list `l` contains exactly the same elements as the generated list `li`.

However, the original assessment claims that the program does not handle the case where the minimum value in the input list `l` is not equal to \(a_{1,1}\). This claim is incorrect because the program does not assume that the smallest element in `l` is \(a_{1,1}\). Instead, it calculates \(a_{1,1}\) as the minimum value in `l` and then generates the entire list `li` based on this value.

Let's verify this with the example provided in the original assessment:
```
3 2 3
3 9 6 5 7 11
```

1. The minimum value in the input list is 3.
2. The program calculates \(a_{1,1}\) as 3.
3. It generates the list `li` using the formula \(a + k \cdot c + d \cdot h\):
   - For \(k = 0, h = 0\): \(3 + 0 \cdot 2 + 0 \cdot 3 = 3\)
   - For \(k = 1, h = 0\): \(3 + 1 \cdot 2 + 0 \cdot 3 = 5\)
   - For \(k = 2, h = 0\): \(3 + 2 \cdot 2 + 0 \cdot 3 = 7\)
   - For \(k = 0, h = 1\): \(3 + 0 \cdot 2 + 1 \cdot 3 = 6\)
   - For \(k = 1, h = 1\): \(3 + 1 \cdot 2 + 1 \cdot 3 = 8\)
   - For \(k = 2, h = 1\): \(3 + 2 \cdot 2 + 1 \cdot 3 = 10\)
   - For \(k = 0, h = 2\): \(3 + 0 \cdot 2 + 2 \cdot 3 = 9\)
   - For \(k = 1, h = 2\): \(3 + 1 \cdot 2 + 2 \cdot 3 = 11\)
   - For \(k = 2, h = 2\): \(3 + 2 \cdot 2 + 2 \cdot 3 = 13\)

4. The generated list `li` is `[3, 5, 7, 6, 8, 10, 9, 11, 13]`.
5. The input list `l` is `[3, 9, 6, 5, 7, 11]`.
6. Sorting both lists gives `[3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13]` and `[3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13]`, respectively.
7. Since the sorted lists are equal, the program correctly outputs "NO" because the input list does not match the expected progressive square.

Thus, the program correctly handles the case where the minimum value in the input list is not equal to \(a_{1,1}\).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct and accurately implements the logic to determine if the input list can form a progressive square based on the given `c` and `d`.
