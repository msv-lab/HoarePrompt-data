Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n`, `c`, `d`, and the list `l` of integers.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes `n`, `c`, `d`, and `l` as arguments.
   - It calculates the minimum value in the list `l` and stores it in `a`.
   - It then constructs a list `li` where each element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for all possible pairs `(k, h)` within the range `[0, n-1]`.
   - The list `li` is sorted.
   - The input list `l` is also sorted.
   - Finally, it checks if the sorted list `l` matches the sorted list `li`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic of constructing the progressive square is correct. Given `a_{1,1} = a`, `c`, and `d`, the value at position `(k, h)` in the progressive square is `a + k * c + d * h`.
   - Sorting both lists before comparison ensures that the order of elements is checked correctly.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the construction and sorting of the lists correctly.
   - It checks if the sorted list `l` matches the generated list `li`, which should contain all elements of the progressive square in sorted order.

5. **Output:**
   - The function returns `'yes'` if the lists match, otherwise `'no'`.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to check if the provided list `l` can form a progressive square with the given parameters `n`, `c`, and `d`. The steps are logically sound and handle the required operations accurately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
