Output State: **`k` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `h` is 1, `li` is a list containing the value `a + k * c + d * h` and the appended value `a + k * c + d * h`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `a + k * c + d * h` to the list `li`. Given that `k` is 0 and `h` is 1, the expression simplifies to `a + 0 * c + d * 1`, which is just `a + d`. Therefore, the list `li` now contains the original value `a + k * c + d * h` plus the new value `a + d`.
