Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `k` and `n`.
2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `k` is less than `n`. Therefore, `k` should start from 0 (the initial value) and `n` should be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 500\)
- `c` and `d` are integers such that \(1 \leq c, d \leq 10^6\)
- `l` is a list of \(n^2\) integers where each integer is in the range \([1, 10^9]\)
- `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`
- `li` is an empty list

Only the variables `k` and `n` are relevant to the loop head, and they need to be adjusted accordingly.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - `k` should start from 0.
   - `n` should be within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 500\).

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

**State: **`k` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500**
