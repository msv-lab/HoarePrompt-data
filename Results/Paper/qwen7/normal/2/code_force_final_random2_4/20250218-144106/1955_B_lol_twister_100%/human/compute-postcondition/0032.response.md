Output State: **`li` is a sorted list with `n` elements: `a + k * c`, `a + k * c + d`, `a + k * c + 2*d`, ..., `a + k * c + (n-1)*d` and the list is now sorted.**

Explanation: The original list `li` was already in a sequence where each element was given by the formula `a + k * c + i*d` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`. Since the list was already sorted according to this sequence, calling `l.sort()` does not change the order of the elements. Therefore, the list remains the same, but now it is explicitly stated that the list is sorted.
