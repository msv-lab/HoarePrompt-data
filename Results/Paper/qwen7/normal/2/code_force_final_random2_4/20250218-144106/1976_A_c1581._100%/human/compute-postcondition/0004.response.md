Output State: **`password` must have at least one character, and there exists at least one digit within the `password`; `digits` is a list that now contains the character `char`.**

Explanation: The code appends the character `char` to the list `digits`. Since `password` must have at least one character and there exists at least one digit within `password`, appending a character to `digits` does not change these conditions. Therefore, `password` still has at least one character and contains at least one digit. The list `digits` now includes the character `char`.
