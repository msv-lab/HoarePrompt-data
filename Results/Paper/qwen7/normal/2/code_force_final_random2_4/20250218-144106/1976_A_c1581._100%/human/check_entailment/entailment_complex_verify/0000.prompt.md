You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program: 
testCases = int(input())
while testCases:
    length = int(input())
    password = input()
    print('YES') if func_1(password) else print('NO')
    testCases -= 1

def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
        if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
            return False
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    if sortedPassword == password:
        return True
    else:
        return False



- Annotated Code: 
testCases = int(input())
while testCases:
    length = int(input())
    password = input()
    print('YES') if func_1(password) else print('NO')
    testCases -= 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: password is a string of length 1 <= n <= 20, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `password` is processed such that all its digits are collected into the `digits` list, and all its letters are collected into the `letters` list.
    digits.sort()
    letters.sort()
    for i in range(len(digits)):
        if i < len(digits) - 1 and digits[i] > digits[i + 1]:
            return False
        
        if i < len(letters) and digits[-1] > letters[i]:
            return False
        
    #State: Output State: The `letters` list is a sorted list, `i` is equal to the length of `digits`, and `digits` is a list. No conditions inside the loop have triggered a return statement, meaning that the loop has completed all its iterations without encountering any breaking conditions. Therefore, the function has successfully iterated over all elements in `digits` (and `letters` up to index `i-1`), and no early returns have been made based on the given conditions.
    sortedPassword = ''.join(digits + letters)
    if (sortedPassword == password) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    else :
        return False
        #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a password string and processes it by separating digits and letters into two lists. It then sorts these lists. If the sorted combination of digits and letters matches the original password and certain conditions are met (no adjacent digits are out of order and no digit is greater than the last letter), the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where there are both letters and digits in the password. Specifically, the program checks if the last digit is greater than any of the letters, which is not the correct condition according to the problem description. The description states that all digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order and all letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order, but the program incorrectly checks the relationship between the last digit and the letters.

For example, consider the password `123abc`. According to the problem description, this password should be considered strong because all digits are sorted in non-decreasing order (1, 2, 3) and all letters are sorted in non-decreasing order (a, b, c). However, the program will incorrectly return "NO" for this password because it checks if the last digit (3) is greater than any of the letters, which is false, but it should still be considered a strong password.

To fix this, the program should check if the digits are sorted in non-decreasing order and the letters are sorted in non-decreasing order separately, without comparing them directly.
