### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. This part is accurate and well-handled.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Digit and Letter Separation**: The function correctly separates the characters into digits and letters.
   - **Sorting Digits and Letters**: It sorts the digits and letters separately.
   - **Validation**:
     - **Non-Decreasing Order for Digits**: It checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order.
     - **No Digit After Letter**: It ensures that no digit comes after a letter by comparing the last digit with the first letter.
     - **Sorted Password Construction**: It constructs the sorted password by concatenating the sorted digits and letters.
     - **Final Validation**: It compares the constructed sorted password with the original password to ensure they match.
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - The function does not explicitly check if the password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, which is a critical requirement.
     - The function does not handle the case where the password contains only digits or only letters, which is also required.

3. **Output**: The program prints "YES" if the password is strong and "NO" otherwise. However, the function `func_1` does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Issues Identified:
- **Requirement Check**: The function does not check if the password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits. This is a critical requirement.
- **Only Digits or Only Letters**: The function does not handle the case where the password contains only digits or only letters, which is also required.

### Conclusion:
While the function `func_1` correctly handles the sorting and validation of digits and letters, it fails to address two important aspects of the problem description:
1. Ensuring the password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
2. Handling the case where the password contains only digits or only letters.

Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate because the program does not fully meet the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
