Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `password` is processed such that all its digits are collected into the `digits` list, and all its letters are collected into the `letters` list.**

In more detail, after the loop completes all its iterations:
- The `digits` list will contain all the digits from the original `password`.
- The `letters` list will contain all the lowercase Latin letters from the original `password`.
- The `password` string itself remains unchanged as it is only used to iterate over its characters.
