### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Digit and Letter Separation**: The function correctly separates the characters into digits and letters.
   - **Sorting Digits and Letters**: It sorts the digits and letters separately.
   - **Validation**:
     - **Non-Decreasing Order for Digits**: It checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order.
     - **No Digit After Letter**: It ensures that no digit comes after a letter by comparing the last digit with the first letter.
     - **Sorted Password Construction**: It constructs the sorted password by concatenating the sorted digits and letters.
     - **Final Validation**: It compares the constructed sorted password with the original password to ensure they match.
3. **Output**: The program prints "YES" if the password is strong and "NO" otherwise.

Given the above points, the program appears to be logically sound and should work as expected according to the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
