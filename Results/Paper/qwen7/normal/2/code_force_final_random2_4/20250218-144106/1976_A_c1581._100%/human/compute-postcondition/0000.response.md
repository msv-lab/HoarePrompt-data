Output State: **`password` is a string of length 1 <= n <= 20, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit; `digits` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `digits`. The value of `password` remains unchanged as no operations were performed on it. Therefore, the length and content of `password` remain as per the initial state, while `digits` is now an empty list.
