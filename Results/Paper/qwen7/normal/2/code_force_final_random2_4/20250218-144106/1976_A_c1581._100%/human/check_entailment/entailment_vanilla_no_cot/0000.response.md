Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to check if a password meets the specified conditions. The function `func_1` properly separates digits and letters, sorts them, and then checks if the original password matches the sorted version of its digits followed by its letters. If the conditions are met, it returns `True` (prints "YES"); otherwise, it returns `False` (prints "NO").
