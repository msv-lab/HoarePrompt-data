Postcondition: `password` must have at least two characters, `char` is the second character of `password`. If the first character of `password` is a digit, then `digits` contains the first and second characters of `password`, and `letters` does not contain the first character of `password`. Otherwise, `letters` contains the first and second characters of `password`, and `digits` remains unchanged.
