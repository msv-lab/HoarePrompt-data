Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `char`, which is used to iterate over each character in the `password`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop head variables**:
   - `char` is the variable being iterated over, and it will take on each character of the `password` one by one.
   - `password` is a string of length 1 <= n <= 20, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

3. **Determine the initial conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, there must be at least one character in the `password` string. If the `password` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since the loop will iterate over each character in the `password`, the `password` must contain at least one character for the loop to execute.
   - The `digits` and `letters` lists are empty and do not affect the loop's execution directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on these steps, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`password` must have at least one character**.
