Output State: **`password` must have at least one character, `char` is the first character of `password`, `letters` is a list containing the first character of `password`.**

The code appends the first character of `password` (stored in `char`) to the list `letters`. Since `password` must have at least one character, `letters` will contain exactly one element, which is `char`.
