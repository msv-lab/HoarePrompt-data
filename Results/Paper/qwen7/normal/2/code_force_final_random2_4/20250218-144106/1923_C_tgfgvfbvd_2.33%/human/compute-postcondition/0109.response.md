Output State: **`c` is increased by `x`.**

In this case, the initial state does not provide specific values for `c` and `x`, but the code snippet `c += x` indicates that the value of `c` is increased by the value of `x`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `c` has been updated to its original value plus `x`.
