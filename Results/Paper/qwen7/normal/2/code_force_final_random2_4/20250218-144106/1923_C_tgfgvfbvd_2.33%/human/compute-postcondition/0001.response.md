Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user split by space, `m` is an integer input from the user split by space**.

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input from the user, splits it into two parts based on spaces, and converts these parts into integers. These integers are then assigned to `n` and `m`. Since the actual values of `n` and `m` depend on the user's input, they are described as integer inputs split by space. All other variables remain unaffected, maintaining their initial state as undefined or unspecified.
