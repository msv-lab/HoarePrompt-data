Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 0; `l` must be non-empty; `a` is an input integer with the current value of `a` being greater than or equal to 2; `b` is an input integer; `s` is the element at index `b-1` of list `p`; if `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s` is greater than or equal to twice the length of the sub-list from index `a-1` to `b-1` of list `p`, then `s` is decreased by the element at index `a-2` of list `p` if `a - 2 >= 0`; otherwise, `b - a + 1` is less than or equal to 1 or `s` is less than 2 times `b - a + 1`.
