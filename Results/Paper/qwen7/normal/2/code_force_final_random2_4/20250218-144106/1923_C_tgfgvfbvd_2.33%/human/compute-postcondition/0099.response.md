Based on the initial state provided:

- `m` must be greater than 1.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`.
- `p` is unchanged.

The print statement is simply `print('YES')`.

Since the print statement directly outputs a string without referencing any variables or objects that need further calculation or description, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
