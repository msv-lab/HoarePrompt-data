Output State: **`l` is the list without the first two elements; `c` is the sum of the elements in `l` starting from the second element plus `x`; `p` is now a list containing one element which is `c`.**

Explanation: The code `p.append(c)` appends the value of `c` to the list `p`. Since `c` is already defined as the sum of the elements in `l` starting from the second element plus `x`, appending `c` to `p` means `p` now contains `c` as its only element. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
