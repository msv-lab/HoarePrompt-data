Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 0; `l` must be non-empty; `a` is an input integer with the current value of `a` being greater than or equal to 2; `b` is an input integer; `s` is the element at index `b-1` of list `p`; `s` is decreased by `p[a - 2]` if `a - 2 >= 0`; `b - a + 1` is greater than 1 and the current value of `s` is greater than or equal to 2 times `b - a + 1`.
