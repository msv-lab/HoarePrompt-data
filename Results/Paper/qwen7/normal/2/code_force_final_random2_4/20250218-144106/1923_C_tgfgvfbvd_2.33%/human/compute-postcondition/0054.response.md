Output State: **`m` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer and decreased by the number of iterations, `b` is an input integer, `s` is equal to the element at index `b - 1` of the list `p` minus `m * p[a - 2]`, `n` is an input integer, the list `l` is updated with integers from the input, and the list `p` is now an empty list.**

The code initializes `p` as an empty list, which means all previous values in `p` are no longer valid. All other variables retain their initial states as described in the precondition.
