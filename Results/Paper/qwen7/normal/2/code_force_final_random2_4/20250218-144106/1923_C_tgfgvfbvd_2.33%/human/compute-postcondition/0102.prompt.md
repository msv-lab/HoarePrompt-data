Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `m` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer and decreased by the number of iterations, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`, `s` is equal to the element at index `b - 1` of the list `p` minus `m * p[a - 2]`, `n` is an input integer, the list `l` must be non-empty, and the list `p` now contains all cumulative sums of the elements in `l`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `c` will hold the total sum of all elements in the list `l`. The list `p` will contain each cumulative sum of the elements in `l` as it was appended in each iteration of the loop. The value of `a` and `b` will be decreased by the number of iterations, and `s` will be calculated based on the last element in `p` and the value of `m` and the second-to-last element in `p`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    s = p[b - 1]
    if a - 2 >= 0:
        s -= p[a - 2]
    if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 0; `l` must be non-empty; `a` is an input integer with the current value of `a` being greater than or equal to 2; `b` is an input integer; `s` is the element at index `b-1` of list `p`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s` is greater than or equal to twice the length of the sub-list from index `a-1` to `b-1` of list `p`, then `s` is decreased by the element at index `a-2` of list `p` if `a - 2 >= 0`. Otherwise, `b - a + 1` is less than or equal to 1 or `s` is less than 2 times `b - a + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `s` is the value of `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`. If `b - a + 1 > 1` and `s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`, the condition holds as specified. Otherwise, the condition also holds as specified.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `m` must be greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `s` is equal to `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`, `p` is unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
