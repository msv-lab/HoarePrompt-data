Output State: **`m` is an input integer, `a` is `input_integer - (number_of_iterations + 1)`, `b` is `input_integer - (number_of_iterations + 1)`, `c` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`, `s` is `p[b - 1] - p[a - 2]`, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers created from user input.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the user input and converts each integer into a list. The values of `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `s`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new variable `l` is created and populated with the integers from the user input.
