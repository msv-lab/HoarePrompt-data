Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer and decreased by 1, `b` is an input integer, `s` is equal to the element at index `b - 1` of the list `p` minus `p[a - 2]`, and the current value of `a` is greater than or equal to -1.**

Explanation: The code `s -= p[a - 2]` subtracts the value of `p[a - 2]` from `s`. The value of `a` is decreased by 1 before this operation, so the new value of `a` is `a - 1`. The precondition that `a` is greater than or equal to 0 is now adjusted to `a` being greater than or equal to -1 because `a` was decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
