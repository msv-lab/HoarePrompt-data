Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is added to the set `cx`, `cx` is a set containing the element `x`.**

The code `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`. Since `x` is an input integer, it is now part of the set `cx`. All other variables remain unchanged, with `n` still being greater than 1 and `a` remaining as the first input integer.
