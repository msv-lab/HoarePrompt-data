Postcondition: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is an input integer, and `x` is an input integer. If `a` equals 1, then `x` is updated to the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` equals 2, then `x` is updated to the minimum of `x` and 2. Otherwise, `x` is added to the set `cx`, and `a` is neither 1 nor 2.
