Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is assigned the first integer from the input, `x` is assigned the second integer from the input**.

This means that the value of `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 1. The values of `a` and `x` are now set to the integers entered by the user, specifically, `a` is the first integer and `x` is the second integer.
