Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `cx`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `cx`.

3. **Determine the postconditions inside the loop**: 
   - If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is increased by 1.
   - Otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged.

4. **State at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cx` contains at least one element.
   - If `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged.

5. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `cx` is a list, and the loop iterates over each element in `cx`, the only variable that changes within the loop is `i`.
   - After the previous iteration, `i` was an element of `cx` that either satisfied the condition (increasing `tmp`) or did not satisfy the condition (leaving `tmp` unchanged).
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in `cx`.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `cx` will still contain at least one element because the loop continues as long as there are elements left in `cx`.
   - `i` will be the next element in `cx`.
   - `tmp` will remain unchanged unless the new `i` satisfies the condition (i.e., `bx <= i <= ax`).

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `cx` contains at least one element, `i` is the next element in `cx`, `tmp` remains unchanged.**
