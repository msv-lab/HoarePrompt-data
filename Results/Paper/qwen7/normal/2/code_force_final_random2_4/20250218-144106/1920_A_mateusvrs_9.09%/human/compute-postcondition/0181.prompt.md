Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500; `r` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cx = set()
    ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
    bx = -1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, x = map(int, input().split())
        if a == 1:
            bx = max(x, bx)
        elif a == 2:
            ax = min(x, ax)
        else:
            cx.add(x)
    if bx >= ax:
        r.append(0)
    else:
        tmp = 0
        for i in cx:
            if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                tmp += 1
        r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations, `n` will be 0, `ax` will be the smallest value among all `x` where `a` was 2, `bx` will be the largest value among all `x` where `a` was 1, and `cx` will be a set containing all `x` where `a` was neither 1 nor 2. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, then `r` will be `[0]`. Otherwise, `r` will contain the value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, and `tmp` will be increased by the total number of elements in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the if-else block executes, `n` will have reached 0, indicating the loop has completed all its iterations. `a` and `x` will be those provided in the last input to the loop. `bx` will hold the highest `x` value where the operation was `a == 1`, `ax` will hold the lowest `x` value where the operation was `a == 2`, and `cx` will contain all `x` values for which `a` was neither 1 nor 2. Additionally, if the condition `bx >= ax` is true, `r` will contain the value 0. Otherwise, `cx` will be empty, `tmp` will be equal to the total number of elements in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]`, and `r` will be a list with one element which is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After executing the if-else block, `bx` remains the maximum value among all `x` values where `a` was 1, `ax` remains the minimum value among all `x` values where `a` was 2, and `cx` remains a set containing all unique `x` values where `a` was neither 1 nor 2; `r` is a list containing the value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is incremented for each element in `cx` that falls within the range `[bx, ax]` if `bx >= ax`; otherwise, `r` contains the value 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
