Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `bx` is the maximum value between `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` equals 1, then `bx` is the maximum value between `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` equals 2, then `ax` is the minimum value between `x` and `ax`. Otherwise, `x` is added to the set `cx`.
