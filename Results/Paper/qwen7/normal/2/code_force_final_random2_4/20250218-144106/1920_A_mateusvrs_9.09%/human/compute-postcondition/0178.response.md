Postcondition: `bx` is the maximum value among all `x` values where `a` was 1, `ax` is the minimum value among all `x` values where `a` was 2, and `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values where `a` was neither 1 nor 2; `r` is a list containing the value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is incremented for each element in `cx` that falls within the range `[bx, ax]` until no more elements in `cx` satisfy this condition; if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, then `r` contains the value 0.
