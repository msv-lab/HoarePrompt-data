Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `x` is an integer from the input, and `a` is not equal to 1. If `a` equals 2, then `x` is the minimum of the original `x` and `ax`, and `ax` is the minimum of the original `x` and `ax`. If `a` does not equal 2, then `x` remains unchanged and is stored in `cx`.
