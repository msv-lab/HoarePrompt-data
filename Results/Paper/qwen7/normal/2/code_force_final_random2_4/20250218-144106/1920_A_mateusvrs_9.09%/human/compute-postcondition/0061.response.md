Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ax` is the smallest value among all `x` where `a` was 2, `bx` is the largest value among all `x` where `a` was 1, `cx` is a set containing all `x` where `a` was neither 1 nor 2, `r` is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, and `tmp` is increased by the total number of elements in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]`.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The values of `ax`, `bx`, `cx`, `r`, and `tmp` remain unchanged from their initial state because they are not affected by this line of code. The only change is that `n` now holds the value of the integer input.
