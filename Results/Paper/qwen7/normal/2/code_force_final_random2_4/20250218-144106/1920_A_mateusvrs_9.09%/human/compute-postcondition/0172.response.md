Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `cx`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element `i` in `cx`.

3. **Determine the postconditions for the loop**:
   - `cx` must have at least one element.
   - `tmp` is increased by 1 if `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]`.
   - If `i` is not within this range, the values of `cx` and `tmp` remain unchanged.

4. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cx` must have at least one element.
   - `tmp` is increased by 1 if `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]`.

5. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in `cx`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in `cx`.
   - `cx` must still have at least one element (since it must have at least one element for the loop to continue).
   - `tmp` will be increased by 1 if the new `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]`.

Given these points, let's formulate the state at the start of the next iteration:

- `cx` must still have at least one element.
- `tmp` will be increased by 1 if the new `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `i` at the start of the next iteration, we can only say that `cx` must have at least one element and `tmp` will be increased by 1 if the new `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`cx` must have at least one element, and `tmp` will be increased by 1 if the new `i` is within the range `[bx, ax]`**.
