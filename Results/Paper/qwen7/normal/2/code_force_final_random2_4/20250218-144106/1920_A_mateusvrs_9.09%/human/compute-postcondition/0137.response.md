Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, and `x` is an integer from the input. If `a` is 1, `x` is updated to the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` is 2, `x` is updated to the minimum of the original `x` and `ax`, and `ax` is also updated to the same value. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `x` remains unchanged and is stored in `cx`.
