Output State: **`n` must be a positive integer, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `a, x = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into integers. These integers are then assigned to the variables `a` and `x`. The variable `n` remains unchanged and still must be a positive integer.
