Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` equals 1, `x` is updated to be the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` equals 2, `x` is the smaller of `x` and `a`. Otherwise, `x` is added to the set `cx`, where `cx` is a set containing the element `x`.
