Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `n` is 0, `bx` is undefined**.

Explanation: The code `a, x = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `a` and `x` respectively. The variable `n` remains unchanged and is still 0. The variable `bx` is not defined or updated in this code snippet, so it remains undefined.
