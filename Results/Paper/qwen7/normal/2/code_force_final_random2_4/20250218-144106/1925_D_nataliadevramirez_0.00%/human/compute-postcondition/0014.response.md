Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `friendships` is a list of `m` lists, each containing two integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`**.

The function `func_1` is called with the arguments `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships`. Since the function call does not specify what `func_1` returns, we assume it returns a value which is stored in the variable `result`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
