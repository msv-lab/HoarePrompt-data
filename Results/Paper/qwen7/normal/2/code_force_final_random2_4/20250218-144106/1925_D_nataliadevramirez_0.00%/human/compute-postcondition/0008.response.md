Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `friendships` is a list of `m` lists, each containing two integers which are the result of converting input strings to integers.**

Explanation: The code creates a list of lists named `friendships`. Each inner list contains two integers, which are obtained by splitting a line of input and converting each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`. This process is repeated `m` times, resulting in a list of `m` such pairs. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
