Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships`.
   - It initializes `result` to 0.
   - It iterates through each friendship and adds to `result` the product of the friendship value (`f`) and the sum of the first `k` natural numbers (`k * (k + 1) // 2`).
   - The result is returned modulo `MOD`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function handles the input and output.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It reads the list of friendships.
   - It calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments and prints the result.

### Correctness Check

#### Problem Understanding
- We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.
- The friendship value of a pair increases by 1 each time it is chosen, but only if the pair is friends.
- The expected value calculation should account for the probability of choosing each pair.

#### Key Points to Verify
1. **Sum of First `k` Natural Numbers**: 
   - The formula `k * (k + 1) // 2` correctly calculates the sum of the first `k` natural numbers.
   
2. **Friendship Value Calculation**:
   - The program multiplies the friendship value `f` by the sum of the first `k` natural numbers.
   - This is correct because each time a friendship pair is chosen, its value increases by 1, and this effect is cumulative over `k` excursions.

3. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The result is taken modulo `10^9 + 7` to handle large numbers, which is correct.

4. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases and reads the necessary inputs for each test case.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It accurately calculates the expected sum of friendship values and handles the modulo operation appropriately.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**
