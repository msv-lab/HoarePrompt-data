Output State: `t` must be greater than or equal to the total number of times the loop has executed, `n` is the last input integer received, `m` is the last input integer received, `k` is the last input integer received, `friendships` is a list of `m` lists, each containing two integers, which are the last set of friendship inputs received, `result` is the cumulative return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)` for each iteration of the loop.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be at least as large as the number of times the loop ran. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` will be the last set of inputs provided by the user during the final iteration of the loop. The `friendships` list will contain all the sets of friendships entered over the course of all iterations. Lastly, `result` will hold the combined results from calling `func_1` in each iteration of the loop.
