Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `friendships` is a list of lists containing integers, `n` is updated to the first input integer, `m` is updated to the second input integer, `k` is updated to the third input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. The values of `t`, `friendships`, and `result` remain unchanged from their initial states.
