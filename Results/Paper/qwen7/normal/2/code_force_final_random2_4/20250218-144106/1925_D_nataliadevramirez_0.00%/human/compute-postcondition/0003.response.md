Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, friendships is a list of lists containing integers**.

Explanation: The code creates a list called `friendships` by taking input from the user `m` times. Each time, it reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and converts those integers to integers using `map(int, ...)`. This results in a list of lists where each inner list contains integers representing friendships. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
