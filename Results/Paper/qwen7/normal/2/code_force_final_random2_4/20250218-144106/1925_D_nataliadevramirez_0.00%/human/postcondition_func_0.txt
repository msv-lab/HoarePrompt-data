The function accepts four parameters: `n` (number of children), `m` (number of pairs of friends), `k` (number of excursions), and `friendships` (a list of tuples containing friend indices and their values). It calculates and returns the value of `result` which is `m * f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD`, where `f` is the friendship value from the `friendships` list and `MOD` is set to \(10^9 + 7\).
