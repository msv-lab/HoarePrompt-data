Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `friendships` is a list of `m` lists, each containing two integers which are the result of converting input strings to integers, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)`**.

Explanation: The code calls the function `func_1` with parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships`. Since the function call does not specify what `func_1` returns, we assume it returns a value. This returned value is assigned to the variable `result`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` remain unchanged from their initial states.
