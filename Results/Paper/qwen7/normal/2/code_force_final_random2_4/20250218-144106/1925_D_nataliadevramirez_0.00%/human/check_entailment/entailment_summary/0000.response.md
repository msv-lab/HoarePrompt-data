Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions.
2. The provided code consists of two functions:
   - `func_1`: This function calculates the contribution of each friendship pair to the expected value. It iterates through each friendship pair, multiplies the friendship value by the expected number of times the pair will be chosen, and sums these contributions.
   - `func_2`: This function handles the input and calls `func_1` for each test case, printing the result for each test case.

3. Let's analyze the correctness of each part:
   - `func_1` correctly calculates the expected value for each friendship pair. The formula used is \( f \times \binom{k}{2} \), which is equivalent to \( f \times \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \). This accounts for the expected number of times each friendship pair is chosen, considering the random selection process.
   - `func_2` correctly reads the input for each test case, processes the friendships, and calls `func_1` to get the result for each test case. It then prints the result for each test case.

4. Given the problem constraints and the execution summaries, both functions appear to be correctly implemented and aligned with the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
