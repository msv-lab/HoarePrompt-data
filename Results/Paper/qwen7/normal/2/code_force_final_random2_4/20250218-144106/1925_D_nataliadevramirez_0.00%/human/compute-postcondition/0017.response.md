Output State: `t` must be greater than or equal to the total number of times the loop has executed, `n` is the last input integer received, `m` is the last input integer received, `k` is the last input integer received, `friendships` is a list of `m` lists, each containing two integers (the last set of friendships entered), `result` is the cumulative return value of `func_1(n, m, k, friendships)` for each iteration of the loop.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be the final value it was set to, `n`, `m`, and `k` will hold the values from the last iteration, `friendships` will contain the last set of friendships entered, and `result` will be the combined result of applying `func_1` in each iteration of the loop.
