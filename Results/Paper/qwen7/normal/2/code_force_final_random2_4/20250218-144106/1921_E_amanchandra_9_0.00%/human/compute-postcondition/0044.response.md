Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `h` is an integer (its value is not specified).
   - `w` is an integer (its value is not specified).
   - `xa` is an integer (its value is not specified).
   - `ya` is an integer (its value is not specified).
   - `xb` is an integer (its value is not specified).
   - `yb` is an integer (its value is not specified).
   - `x` is 0.
   - `l` is `max(1, ya - 0)`, so `l = max(1, ya)`.
   - `r` is `min(w, yb + x)`, so `r = min(w, yb)`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x])
   ```

3. **Evaluate Conditions:**
   - `x` is 0, so `abs(l - yb) <= x` simplifies to `abs(max(1, ya) - yb) <= 0`.
     - For this condition to be true, `max(1, ya)` must be equal to `yb`. This means `yb` must be either 1 if `ya < 1` or `ya` if `ya >= 1`.
   - `r = min(w, yb)`, so `abs(r - yb) <= x` simplifies to `abs(min(w, yb) - yb) <= 0`.
     - For this condition to be true, `min(w, yb)` must be equal to `yb`. This means `yb` must be less than or equal to `w`.

4. **Combining Conditions:**
   - Both conditions need to be true simultaneously.
   - Therefore, `yb` must be 1 (since it must satisfy both conditions).

5. **Final Condition Check:**
   - If `yb` is 1, then `l = max(1, ya) = 1` (since `ya` is an integer and `max(1, ya)` will be 1 if `ya` is 0 or less, and 1 if `ya` is 1 or more).
   - `r = min(w, yb) = min(w, 1) = 1` (since `yb` is 1).

6. **Evaluate the List Indexing:**
   - `abs(l - yb) <= x` becomes `abs(1 - 1) <= 0`, which is `True`.
   - `abs(r - yb) <= x` becomes `abs(1 - 1) <= 0`, which is `True`.
   - Both conditions are true, so the list indexing `[True and True]` results in `[True]`.

7. **Final Output:**
   - The list `[True]` is unpacked with `*`, resulting in `['Draw']`.
   - Therefore, the print statement will output `['Draw']`.

Output: **['Draw']**
