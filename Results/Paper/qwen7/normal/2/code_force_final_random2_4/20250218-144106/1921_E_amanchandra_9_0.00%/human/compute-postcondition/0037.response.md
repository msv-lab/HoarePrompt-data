Let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `h` is an integer (its value is not specified).
   - `w` is an integer (its value is not specified).
   - `xa` is an integer (its value is not specified).
   - `ya` is an integer (its value is not specified).
   - `xb` is an integer (its value is not specified).
   - `yb` is an integer (its value is not specified).

2. **Calculation of `x`:**
   - `x = (abs(xa - xb) / 2)`.
   - This means `x` is half the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb`.

3. **Conditions for `l` and `r`:**
   - If `xa > xb`:
     - `l = max(1, ya - x)`.
     - `r = min(w, yb + x)`.
   - If `xa <= xb`:
     - `l = max(1, yb - x)`.
     - `r = min(w, yb + x)`.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('Draw')`.

Given the print statement `print('Draw')`, it will simply print the string `'Draw'`.

Output: **Draw**
