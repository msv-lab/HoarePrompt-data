Postcondition: `i` is 1, `h` is an integer, `w` is an integer, `xa` is an integer, `ya` is an integer, `xb` is an integer, `yb` is an integer, `x` is `(abs(xa - xb) / 2)`, `l` is either `max(1, yb - x)` or `max(1, ya - x)`, and `r` is either `min(w, yb + x)` or `min(w, yb + x)`, depending on whether `abs(xa - xb) % 2` is true or false.
