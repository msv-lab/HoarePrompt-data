Postcondition: `i` is 1, `h` is an integer, `w` is an integer, `xa` is an integer, `ya` is an integer, `xb` is an integer, `yb` is an integer, `x` is `(abs(xa - xb) / 2)`, if `xa > xb`, then `l` is `max(1, yb - x)` and `r` is `min(w, yb + x)`. Otherwise, `l` is `max(1, ya - x)` and `r` is `min(w, yb + x)`.
