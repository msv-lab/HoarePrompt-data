Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of six integers (h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b). For each test case, it calculates the outcome based on the positions of points (x_a, y_a) and (x_b, y_b) on a grid of size h x w. If x_a is greater than x_b, it prints 'Draw'. Otherwise, it calculates the distance between x_a and x_b and determines if Alice or Bob wins based on the vertical distance and the calculated midpoint. The function returns 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob' for each test case, indicating the winner or a draw.**
