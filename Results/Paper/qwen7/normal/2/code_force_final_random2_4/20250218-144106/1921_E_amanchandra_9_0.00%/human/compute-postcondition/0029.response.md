Output State: **`i` is 1, `h` is an input integer, `w` is an input integer, `xa` is an input integer, `ya` is an input integer, `xb` is an input integer, `yb` is an input integer, `x` is `(abs(xa - xb) / 2)`, `l` is `max(1, ya - x)`, `r` is `min(w, yb + x)`**.

The code calculates `x` as the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` divided by 2, and `l` as the maximum of 1 and `ya - x`. Then, `r` is assigned the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
