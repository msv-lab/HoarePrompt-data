Reasoning:

1. **Test Cases Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop to process each test case individually. This matches the problem statement which specifies that the input starts with an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases.

2. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input for each test case using `map(int, input().split())`, which aligns with the expected format of six integers per test case.

3. **Condition Checking**: 
   - The condition `if xa > xb:` checks if Alice's chip is below Bob's chip vertically. If true, it prints 'Draw', which is correct because Alice cannot reach Bob's position without Bob moving first, and Bob cannot move above the first row.

4. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The calculation of `x = abs(xa - xb) // 2` is used to determine the midpoint between Alice and Bob horizontally.
   - The logic to determine the outcome based on the vertical distances and the calculated midpoint is implemented correctly. Specifically:
     - For odd distances (`abs(xa - xb) % 2`), it calculates the range `[l, r]` where `l = max(1, yb - x)` and `r = min(w, yb + x)`.
     - It then checks if the vertical distance from Alice's current position to this range is within the calculated limit, determining whether Alice can force a win or if it remains a draw.

5. **Output Format**: The program prints 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob' for each test case, which matches the required output format.

Given the detailed analysis, the program appears to handle all aspects of the problem correctly according to the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
