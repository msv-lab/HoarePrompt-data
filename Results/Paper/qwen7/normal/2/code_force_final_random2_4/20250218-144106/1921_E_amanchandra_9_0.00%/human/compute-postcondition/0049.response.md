Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the total number of test cases entered as input. For each iteration `i` from 0 to the total number of test cases minus one, the following conditions hold:

- `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` are integers obtained from the input split for each test case.
- If `xa > xb`, then `xa` remains unchanged and "Draw" is printed.
- Otherwise, `x` is calculated as `abs(xa - xb) // 2`.
- If `abs(xa - xb)` is odd, `l` is set to `max(1, yb - x)` and `r` is set to `min(w, yb + x)`.
- If `abs(xa - xb)` is even, `l` is set to `max(1, ya - x)` and `r` is set to `min(w, yb + x)`.
- Depending on whether the conditions involving `l` and `r` are met, either "Draw" or the name "Alice" or "Bob" is printed.

All other variables outside the loop, including any global variables or those initialized before the loop, retain their initial or last known states from the previous iterations.
