Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < int(input())`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` are integers obtained from the input split.

4. **Next iteration requirements**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `int(input())`.
   - Since `i` is currently 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjusting the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, so it will become 1.
   - `int(input())` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration unless new input is provided, but we assume no new input is provided for simplicity.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**Final State**:
- `i` is 1 (since it will be incremented from 0).
- `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` remain the same as they were in the previous iteration.

State: **`i` is 1, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` are integers obtained from the input split**.
