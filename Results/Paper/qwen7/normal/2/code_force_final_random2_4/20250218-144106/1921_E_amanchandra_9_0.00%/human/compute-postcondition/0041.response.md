Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `h` is an integer (its value is not relevant for this specific print statement).
   - `w` is an integer (its value is not relevant for this specific print statement).
   - `xa` is an integer (its value is not relevant for this specific print statement).
   - `ya` is an integer (its value is not relevant for this specific print statement).
   - `xb` is an integer (its value is not relevant for this specific print statement).
   - `yb` is an integer (its value is not relevant for this specific print statement).
   - `x` is calculated as `abs(xa - xb) // 2`.
   - `l` is calculated as `max(1, yb - x)`.
   - `r` is calculated as `min(w, yb + x)`.

2. **Expression Analysis:**
   - The expression to evaluate is `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1`.

3. **Breakdown of the Expression:**
   - `x` is `abs(xa - xb) // 2`, so it depends on the difference between `xa` and `xb`.
   - `l` is `max(1, yb - x)`, so it is the maximum of 1 and the difference between `yb` and `x`.
   - `r` is `min(w, yb + x)`, so it is the minimum of `w` and the sum of `yb` and `x`.

4. **Condition Evaluation:**
   - For the expression `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1` to be true, both conditions must hold:
     - `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1`
     - `abs(r - ya) <= x + 1`

5. **Possible Values:**
   - Since `l` and `r` are derived from `yb` and `x`, and `x` is half the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb`, the values of `l` and `r` will be centered around `yb` with a margin of `x + 1`.
   - If `ya` falls within the range `[l, r]`, then the condition will be true.

6. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1])`.
   - This will evaluate the boolean expression and select either `'Draw'` or `'Alice'` based on the result.
   - If the condition is true, it will print `'Draw'`; otherwise, it will print `'Alice'`.

Given the initial state and the calculations, the exact values of `xa`, `xb`, `ya`, and `yb` are not specified, but the logic ensures that if `ya` falls within the range `[l, r]`, the condition will be true, and `'Draw'` will be printed.

Output: **Draw**
