Output State: **`i` is 1, `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` are integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into six parts, and converts each part to an integer. The variable `i` remains unchanged and is still equal to 1. The variables `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` are now integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.
