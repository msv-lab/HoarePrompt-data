Postcondition: `i` is 2, `h` is an integer, `w` is an integer, `xa` is an integer, `ya` is an integer, `xb` is an integer, `yb` is an integer. If `abs(xa - xb) % 2` is true, then `x` is `abs(xa - xb) // 2`, `l` is `max(1, yb - x)`, and `r` is `min(w, yb + x)`. Otherwise, `x` is 0, `l` is `max(1, ya - 0)`, and `r` is `min(w, yb + x)`.
