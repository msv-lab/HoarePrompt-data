Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly parses the input for each test case.
2. The logic for determining the outcome of the game is implemented as follows:
   - If `xa > xb`, it immediately prints 'Draw'.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the midpoint `x` between `xa` and `xb`.
   - Depending on whether the difference between `xa` and `xb` is even or odd, it calculates the valid range for the y-coordinate (`l` and `r`).
   - It then checks if the y-coordinate of the opponent's chip falls within this range plus an additional condition to ensure the player can win.
3. The logic seems to handle the conditions described in the problem statement accurately.
4. The output format matches the requirements specified in the problem.

Given the above analysis, the annotated program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the game outcome based on the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
