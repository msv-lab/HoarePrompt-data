Output State: **`i` is 2, `h` is an integer, `w` is an integer, `xa` is an integer, `ya` is an integer, `xb` is an integer, `yb` is an integer, `x` is `abs(xa - xb) // 2`, `l` is `max(1, yb - x)`, `r` is `min(w, yb + x)`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `r` to be the minimum between `w` and `yb + x`. Since `x` is already calculated as `abs(xa - xb) // 2` and `l` is calculated as `max(1, yb - x)`, these values remain unchanged. The new variable `r` is introduced with its value being the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`. All other variables retain their initial or previously calculated states.
