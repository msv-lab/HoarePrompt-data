Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` are integers obtained from the input split.
   - `x` is the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` divided by 2, and the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd.
   - `l` is the maximum of 1 and `yb - x`.
   - `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`.

2. **Code to Analyze:**
   ```python
   print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1])
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**

   - First, let's determine the value of `x`:
     - Since the absolute difference between `xa` and `xb` is odd, `x` will be `(xa - xb) // 2` (integer division), which means `x` is an integer such that `2x + 1 = |xa - xb|`.

   - Next, let's find the values of `l` and `r`:
     - `l` is the maximum of 1 and `yb - x`.
     - `r` is the minimum of `w` and `yb + x`.

   - Now, let's evaluate the condition inside the print statement:
     - We need to check if `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - ya) <= x + 1`.
     - If both conditions are true, it will print `['Alice']`, otherwise it will print `['Draw']`.

4. **Determine the Output:**

   - Given the condition `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1`, we need to analyze the possible values of `l` and `r` relative to `ya`:
     - Since `l` is `max(1, yb - x)` and `r` is `min(w, yb + x)`, both `l` and `r` are centered around `yb` with a range of `2x + 1` (since `x` is half of the odd difference).
     - For `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - ya) <= x + 1` to be true, `ya` must lie within the interval `[l, r]`.

   - Since `l` and `r` are derived from `yb` and `x`, and considering the constraints, `ya` must indeed lie within the interval `[l, r]` for the condition to hold true.

Therefore, the condition `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1` evaluates to `True`.

Output: **Alice**
