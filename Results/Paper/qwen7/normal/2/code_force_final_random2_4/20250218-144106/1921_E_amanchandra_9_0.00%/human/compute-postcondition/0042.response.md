Output State: **`i` is 2, `h` is an integer, `w` is an integer, `xa` is an integer, `ya` is an integer, `xb` is an integer, `yb` is an integer, `x` is 0, `l` is `max(1, ya - 0)`**.

Explanation: Initially, `x` is calculated as `abs(xa - xb) // 2`, which results in 0 since `xa` and `xb` are equal. Then, `l` is assigned the value of `max(1, ya - x)`, which simplifies to `max(1, ya)`. Since `ya` is an integer, `l` will be `max(1, ya)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
