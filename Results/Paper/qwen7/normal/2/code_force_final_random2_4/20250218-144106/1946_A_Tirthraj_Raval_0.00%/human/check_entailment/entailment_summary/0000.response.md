Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program attempts to count the occurrences of the median value in the sorted array but does not actually perform any operations to increase the median. Instead, it simply outputs the frequency of the median value, which is not what the problem requires.

To solve the problem correctly, the program needs to:
1. Sort the array.
2. Determine the median based on the sorted array.
3. Calculate the number of operations needed to make the median larger than its current value.

The program should iterate through the array and count how many operations are needed to make the median strictly greater than its current value. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    """Median of Array"""
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        p = (n + 1) // 2 - 1
        median = a[p]
        operations = 0
        
        # Count how many operations are needed to make the median strictly greater
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] <= median:
                operations += 1
            else:
                break
        
        print(operations)

func()
```

This corrected version will properly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.

Correctness: **False**
