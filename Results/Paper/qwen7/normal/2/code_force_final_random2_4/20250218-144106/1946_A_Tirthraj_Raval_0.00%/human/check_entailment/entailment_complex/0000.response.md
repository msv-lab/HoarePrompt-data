Reasoning:
The provided function does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function calculates the count of the median element(s) in the sorted list, but the problem requires finding the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median of the array. The function does not account for the actual values of the elements and their differences from the median, nor does it consider the possibility of increasing any element to achieve a higher median.

The function should:
1. Sort the array.
2. Determine the median index.
3. Calculate the difference between the median and the smallest element that is less than the median.
4. Sum these differences to get the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

Given the current implementation, the function is calculating the count of the median element(s) rather than the minimum number of operations to increase the median. Therefore, the function is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
