You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 10^9 inclusive.
def func():
    """Median of Array"""
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        p = (n + 1) // 2 - 1
        
        res = a.count(a[p])
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all its iterations is as follows: `a` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the last input provided by the user; `p` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2 - 1` using the value of `n` from the last iteration; `res` is the count of elements in `a` that are equal to the element at index `p`; `n` is an integer input from the user during the last iteration; `t` is the total number of iterations the loop executed, which is an integer greater than 0; `res` holds the count of elements in `a` that are equal to the element at index `p` after all iterations.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations, `res` will contain the count of the median element(s) in the final list `a` that was sorted and processed in the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `a` of `n` integers, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5 inclusive, and each integer in the list is in the range 1 to 10^9 inclusive. The function does not return anything explicitly but processes the list `a`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
