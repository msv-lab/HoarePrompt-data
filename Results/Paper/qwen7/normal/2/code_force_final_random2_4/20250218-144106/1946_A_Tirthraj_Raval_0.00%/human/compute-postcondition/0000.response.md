Output State: **t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, a is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 10^9 inclusive.**

Explanation: The provided code is just a comment block stating "Median of Array". No operations are performed on the variables `t`, `n`, or `a`. Therefore, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
