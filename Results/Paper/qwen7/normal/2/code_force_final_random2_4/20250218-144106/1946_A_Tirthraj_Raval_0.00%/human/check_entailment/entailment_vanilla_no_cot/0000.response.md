Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program calculates the number of occurrences of the median value in the sorted array but does not actually perform any operations to increase the median value. The problem requires finding the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median, which means we need to determine how many times we need to increment elements to make the median greater than its current value.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    """Median of Array"""
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        p = (n + 1) // 2 - 1
        median = a[p]
        count = a.count(median)
        
        # Calculate the target value for the median to be increased
        target = median + 1
        
        # Count how many operations are needed
        operations = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == median:
                operations += max(0, target - a[i])
        
        print(operations)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Sorting the Array**: The array `a` is sorted to find the median.
2. **Finding the Median**: The median is found at index `p = (n + 1) // 2 - 1`.
3. **Counting Occurrences of the Current Median**: We count how many times the current median appears in the array.
4. **Calculating Target Value**: The target value for the median is set to `median + 1`.
5. **Counting Operations**: We iterate through the array and count the number of operations needed to make each occurrence of the current median equal to the target value.

This approach ensures that we correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.
