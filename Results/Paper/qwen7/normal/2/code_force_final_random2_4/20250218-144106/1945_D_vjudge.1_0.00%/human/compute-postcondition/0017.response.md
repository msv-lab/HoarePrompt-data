Output State: **`soma_b` is an integer; `n` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`; `k` is an integer; `lista_A` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order; `lista_B` is a list of integers in reverse order; `pref` is either `soma_b + lista_A[i]` if `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]` or `0` if `lista_A[i] >= lista_B[i]` for all `i` where `0 <= i < n`; `i` is `m + 1` where `m` is the current value of `i` from the previous iteration and `m + 1 < n - k`; `pref` is updated to `pref + soma_b`.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows:

`soma_b` remains an integer. `n` is still greater than or equal to `k + 1`. `k` is still an integer. `lista_A` is still a list of `n` integers in reverse order. `lista_B` is still a list of integers in reverse order. `pref` is updated to be the previous value of `pref` plus `soma_b`. `i` is still `m + 1` where `m` is the current value of `i` from the previous iteration and `m + 1 < n - k`.
