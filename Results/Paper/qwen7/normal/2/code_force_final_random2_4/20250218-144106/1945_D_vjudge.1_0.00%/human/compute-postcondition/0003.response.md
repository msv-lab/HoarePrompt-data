Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined as `for _ in range(numero_testes)`. The only variable involved here is `numero_testes`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `numero_testes` is greater than 0.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration, `numero_testes` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{numero\_testes} \leq 10^4\) and \(\text{numero\_testes} > 0\).

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `numero_testes` must still be greater than 0. Since the loop decrements `numero_testes` by 1 each time it runs, the new value of `numero_testes` will be `numero_testes - 1`.

5. **Formulate the new state**: Given that `numero_testes` was greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `numero_testes` will still be greater than 0 but decreased by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`numero_testes` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{numero\_testes} \leq 10^4\) and \(\text{numero\_testes} > 0\), but decremented by 1**. 

In other words, if `numero_testes` was \(k\) (where \(1 \leq k \leq 10^4\) and \(k > 0\)), then at the start of the next iteration, `numero_testes` will be \(k-1\).

So, the final state is:

State: **`numero_testes` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{numero_testes} \leq 10^3\) and \(\text{numero_testes} > 0\)**.
