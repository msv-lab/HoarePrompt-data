Output State: `soma_b` is the sum of all elements in `lista_B` from index `n - k` to the end of the list, `n` remains the same, `k` remains the same, `lista_A` remains the same, `lista_B` remains the same, `pref` remains the same, `i` is the last index in the range `[n - k, n)`, `resultado` is the minimum value obtained by adding `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` for each iteration of the loop.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `soma_b` will be the cumulative sum of all elements in `lista_B` starting from the index `n - k` to the last element of the list. The variable `resultado` will hold the minimum value calculated during the loop, which is the result of `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` for each iteration.
