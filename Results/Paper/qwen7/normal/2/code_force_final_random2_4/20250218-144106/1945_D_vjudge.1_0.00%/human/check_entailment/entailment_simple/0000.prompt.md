Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

# Annotated Program:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000, lista_A is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, and lista_B is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    lista_A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_A.reverse()
    lista_B = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_B.reverse()
    soma_b = 0
    pref = 0
    for i in range(n - k):
        if lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]:
            pref += soma_b
            pref += lista_A[i]
            soma_b = 0
        else:
            soma_b += lista_B[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `soma_b` is an integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, `k` is an integer, `lista_A` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `lista_B` is a list of integers in reverse order, `pref` is either `soma_b + lista_A[i]` if `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]` or `0` if `lista_A[i] >= lista_B[i]` for all `i` where `0 <= i < n`, `i` is `n - k - 1`. If `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`, `soma_b` remains unchanged and `pref` is set to `soma_b + lista_A[i]`. Otherwise, `soma_b` is increased by `lista_B[i]` and `pref` remains unchanged.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `soma_b` will hold the sum of `lista_A[i]` for all `i` where `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]` and `i` ranges from `0` to `n - k - 1`. The variable `pref` will be the cumulative sum of `soma_b + lista_A[i]` whenever `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`, otherwise, it will be `0` for those cases. The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n - k - 1`, so the final value of `i` will be `n - k - 1`. The lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` remain in their reversed states as they are not modified within the loop.
    resultado = float('inf')
    for i in range(n - k, n):
        resultado = min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])
        
        soma_b += lista_B[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `soma_b` is the sum of all elements in `lista_B` from index `n - k` to the end of the list, `n` remains the same, `k` remains the same, `lista_A` remains the same, `lista_B` remains the same, `pref` remains the same, `i` is the last value it was set to within the range `[n - k, n)`, `resultado` is the minimum value it was updated to during the loop, which is the minimum of `resultado` and `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` for all iterations of the loop.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `soma_b` will be the sum of all elements in `lista_B` starting from index `n - k` to the end of the list. The variable `resultado` will hold the smallest value it was updated to during any iteration of the loop, considering the expression `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]`. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `lista_A`, `lista_B`, `pref`, and `i`) will retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop.
    print(resultado)
    #This is printed: the minimum value of pref + soma_b + lista_A[i] for all iterations of the loop

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: numero_testes is an integer such that 1 ≤ numero_testes ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, and the lists a and b are lists of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
def func_2():
    numero_testes = int(input())
    for _ in range(numero_testes):
        func_1()
        
    #State: Output State: `numero_testes` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{numero_testes} \leq 10^3\) and \(\text{numero_testes} > 2\); `func_1()` has been called `numero_testes` times.
    #
    #This means that after all the iterations of the loop have finished, `numero_testes` will be an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), but it will definitely be greater than 2, as the loop runs from 1 to `numero_testes - 1`. Additionally, `func_1()` will have been called exactly `numero_testes` times.
