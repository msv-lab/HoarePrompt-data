Output State: **`soma_b` is `soma_b + lista_B[i]`, `n` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, `k` is an integer, `lista_A` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `lista_B` is a list of integers in reverse order, `pref` is 0, and for all `i` where `0 <= i < n`, `lista_A[i] is greater than or equal to lista_B[i]`**.

Explanation: The code updates `soma_b` by adding the value of `lista_B[i]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `n` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, `k` is an integer, `lista_A` and `lista_B` are lists of integers in reverse order, and for all `i` where `0 <= i < n`, `lista_A[i] is greater than or equal to lista_B[i]` still holds true.
