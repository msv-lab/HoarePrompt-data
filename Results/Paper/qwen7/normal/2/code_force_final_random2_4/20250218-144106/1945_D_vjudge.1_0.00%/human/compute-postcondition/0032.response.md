Output State: **`soma_b` is an integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, `k` is an integer, `lista_A` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `lista_B` is a list of integers in reverse order, `pref` is either `soma_b + lista_A[i]` if `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]` or `0` if `lista_A[i] >= lista_B[i]` for all `i` where `0 <= i < n`, `i` is `n - k - 1`, `resultado` is positive infinity.**

Explanation: The code sets `resultado` to `float('inf')`, which means `resultado` is now positive infinity. All other variables and their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
