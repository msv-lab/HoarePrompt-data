Output State: **`soma_b` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, `k` is an integer, `lista_A` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `lista_B` is a list of integers in reverse order, `pref` is `soma_b + lista_A[i]` since `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]` for all `i` where `0 <= i < n`, `i` is `m + 1` where `m` is the current value of `i` from the previous iteration and `m + 1 < n - k`.**

Explanation: The line `soma_b = 0` sets the value of `soma_b` to 0. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
