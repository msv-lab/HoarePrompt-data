You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000, lista_A is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, and lista_B is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    lista_A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_A.reverse()
    lista_B = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lista_B.reverse()
    soma_b = 0
    pref = 0
    for i in range(n - k):
        if lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]:
            pref += soma_b
            pref += lista_A[i]
            soma_b = 0
        else:
            soma_b += lista_B[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `soma_b` is an integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, `k` is an integer, `lista_A` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `lista_B` is a list of integers in reverse order, `pref` is either `soma_b + lista_A[i]` if `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]` or `0` if `lista_A[i] >= lista_B[i]` for all `i` where `0 <= i < n`, `i` is `n - k - 1`. If `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`, `soma_b` remains unchanged and `pref` is set to `soma_b + lista_A[i]`. Otherwise, `soma_b` is increased by `lista_B[i]` and `pref` remains unchanged.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `soma_b` will hold the sum of `lista_A[i]` for all `i` where `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]` and `i` ranges from `0` to `n - k - 1`. The variable `pref` will be the cumulative sum of `soma_b + lista_A[i]` whenever `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`, otherwise, it will be `0` for those cases. The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n - k - 1`, so the final value of `i` will be `n - k - 1`. The lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` remain in their reversed states as they are not modified within the loop.
    resultado = float('inf')
    for i in range(n - k, n):
        resultado = min(resultado, pref + soma_b + lista_A[i])
        
        soma_b += lista_B[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `soma_b` is the sum of all elements in `lista_B` from index `n - k` to the end of the list, `n` remains the same, `k` remains the same, `lista_A` remains the same, `lista_B` remains the same, `pref` remains the same, `i` is the last value it was set to within the range `[n - k, n)`, `resultado` is the minimum value it was updated to during the loop, which is the minimum of `resultado` and `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` for all iterations of the loop.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `soma_b` will be the sum of all elements in `lista_B` starting from index `n - k` to the end of the list. The variable `resultado` will hold the smallest value it was updated to during any iteration of the loop, considering the expression `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]`. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `lista_A`, `lista_B`, `pref`, and `i`) will retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop.
    print(resultado)
    #This is printed: the minimum value of pref + soma_b + lista_A[i] for all iterations of the loop
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters n and k, both positive integers with the condition 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 200,000. Additionally, it accepts two lists, lista_A and lista_B, each containing n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. The function returns a value based on the comparison and processing of these inputs.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
