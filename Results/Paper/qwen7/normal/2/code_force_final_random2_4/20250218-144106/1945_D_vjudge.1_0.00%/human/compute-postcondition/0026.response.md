Output State: **`soma_b` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, `k` is an integer, `lista_A` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `lista_B` is a list of integers in reverse order, `pref` is either `soma_b + lista_A[i]` if `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]` or `0` if `lista_A[i] >= lista_B[i]` for all `i` where `0 <= i < n`, `i` is `m + 2` where `m` is the current value of `i` from the previous iteration and `m + 2 < n - k`**

Explanation: The code sets `soma_b` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
