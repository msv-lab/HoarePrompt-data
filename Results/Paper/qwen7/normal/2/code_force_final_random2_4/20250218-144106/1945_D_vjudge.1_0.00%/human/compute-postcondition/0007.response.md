Output State: `numero_testes` is an integer such that \(1 \leq \text{numero_testes} \leq 10^3\) and \(\text{numero_testes} > 2\); `func_1()` has been called `numero_testes` times.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `numero_testes` will be an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), but it will definitely be greater than 2, and `func_1()` will have been called as many times as the final value of `numero_testes`.
