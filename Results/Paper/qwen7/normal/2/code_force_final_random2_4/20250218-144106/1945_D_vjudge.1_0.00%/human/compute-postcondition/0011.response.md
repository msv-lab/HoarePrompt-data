Output State: **`soma_b` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to `k + 1`, `k` is an integer, `lista_A` is a list of `n` integers in reverse order, `lista_B` is a list of integers in reverse order, `pref` is `soma_b + lista_A[i]`**

Explanation: The line `soma_b = 0` sets the value of `soma_b` to 0. However, since `soma_b` was already 0 in the initial state, this assignment does not change its value. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `lista_A`, `lista_B`, and `pref`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
