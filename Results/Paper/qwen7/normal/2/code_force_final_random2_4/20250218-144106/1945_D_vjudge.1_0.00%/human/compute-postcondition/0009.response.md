Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes two integers n and m, and two lists a and b, where n and m satisfy specific constraints, and a and b contain n integers within a certain range. The function returns the result of processing these inputs according to the given constraints.**

This means the function `func_2` does not take any direct parameters. Instead, it seems to handle a series of test cases, each involving two integers \(n\) and \(m\), and two lists \(a\) and \(b\). The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the specified constraints and operations, though the exact nature of the operation is not detailed here.
