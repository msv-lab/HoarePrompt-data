Output State: **`i` is 0 or 1, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1` and is not equal to 1, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, and `temp` is now 2 times its original value.**

Explanation: The code `temp *= 2` multiplies the current value of `temp` by 2. Given that `temp` was either 1 or 2 initially, after executing this line, `temp` will now be 2 (if it was originally 1) or 4 (if it was originally 2). All other variables remain unchanged.
