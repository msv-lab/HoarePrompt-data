You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        
        n, k = list(map(int, l1))
        
        if n == 1:
            print(k)
        else:
            arr = []
            k0 = k
            i = 0
            ans = []
            temp = 1
            while True:
                if temp * 2 < k:
                    temp *= 2
                    i += 1
                else:
                    break
            ans.append((1 << i) - 1)
            ans.append(k - sum(ans))
            ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
            print(*ans)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string for the last test case, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer, and `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer. 
    #
    #If `n` equals 1, then `k` remains unchanged, and `ans` is simply `k` itself. Otherwise, `i` is the final value determined by the loop (either the number of times the loop executed or one less than that), `arr` is an empty list, `k0` equals `k`, `ans` is a list containing `(1 << i) - 1` and `k - sum(ans)`, and `temp` is 2 if `temp * 2 >= k` after the last iteration of the loop, otherwise `temp` is the highest power of 2 less than `k`. `ans` is extended by `[0] * (n - len(ans))` to match the length of `n`.
    #
    #All other variables that were not affected by the loop remain in their initial or previously calculated states from the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes two integers n and k from test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and each test case consists of 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The function returns a value based on the conditions provided for n and k, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
