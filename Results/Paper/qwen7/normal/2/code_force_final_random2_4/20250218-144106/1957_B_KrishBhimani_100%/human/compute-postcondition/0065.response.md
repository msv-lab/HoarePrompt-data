Postcondition: **`i` is either 0 or 1, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list. If `temp * 2 < k`, then `temp` is `temp * 2`; otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
