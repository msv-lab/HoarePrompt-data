Output State: **`i` is either 1 or 2, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 4**.

The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was either 0 or 1, it now becomes either 1 or 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
