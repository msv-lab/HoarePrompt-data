Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is either 0 or 1.
   - `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string. Since no specific input string is given, let's assume the input string is "2" for simplicity (as `n` is derived from the first element of `l1` and is not equal to 1).
     - Therefore, `l1 = ["2"]`.
   - `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1` and is not equal to 1. So, `n = 2`.
   - `arr` is an empty list: `arr = []`.
   - `ans` is a list containing three elements: `(1 << i) - 1`, `0`, and `k - sum(ans)`.
     - Since `i` is either 0 or 1, let's consider both cases:
       - If `i = 0`: `(1 << 0) - 1 = 0`.
       - If `i = 1`: `(1 << 1) - 1 = 1`.
     - `0` is always `0`.
     - `k` is not specified, but we need to calculate `k - sum(ans)`.
       - If `i = 0`, then `ans = [0, 0, k - 0] = [0, 0, k]`.
       - If `i = 1`, then `ans = [1, 0, k - 1]`.
   - `temp` is either the final value it reached after being doubled as many times as possible without exceeding `k`, or 2 if doubling did not occur. Since `k` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `temp`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(*ans)
   ```
   This line will print the elements of the list `ans` separated by spaces.

Given the above breakdown, let's consider both possible values of `i`:

- If `i = 0`:
  - `ans = [0, 0, k]`.
  - The print statement will output: `0 0 k`.

- If `i = 1`:
  - `ans = [1, 0, k - 1]`.
  - The print statement will output: `1 0 k - 1`.

Since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of `k`.

Output: **0 0 k (if i = 0) or 1 0 k - 1 (if i = 1)**
