Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is controlled by the variable `_` (which is just a placeholder for the loop counter) and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `int(input())` is a positive integer. This means that the loop will execute once for each integer input provided by the user.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string.
   - `n` is an integer converted from the first element of `l1`.
   - If `n` equals 1, then `k` is an integer converted from the second element of `l1`.
   - Otherwise, `i` is either 0 or 1, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is a list containing three elements `(1 << i) - 1`, `0`, and `k - sum(ans)`, and `temp` is either the final value it reached after being doubled as many times as possible without exceeding `k`, or 2 if doubling did not occur.

4. **Next Iteration State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the user must provide another integer input.
   - The new value of `n` will be the integer input provided by the user.
   - Based on the value of `n`, the other variables (`k`, `i`, `arr`, `ans`, `temp`) will be updated accordingly.

Given these points, let's determine the state at the start of the next iteration:

- The user will provide a new integer input, which will be assigned to `n`.
- Depending on the value of `n`, the other variables will be initialized or updated.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is the new integer input provided by the user**.

Since the exact values of `k`, `i`, `arr`, `ans`, and `temp` depend on the value of `n`, they cannot be determined without knowing the new value of `n`. However, their initial conditions based on the value of `n` will be as follows:

- If `n == 1`, then `k` will be the integer converted from the second element of `l1`.
- Otherwise, `i` will be either 0 or 1, `arr` will be an empty list, `ans` will be a list containing three elements `(1 << i) - 1`, `0`, and `k - sum(ans)`, and `temp` will be either the final value it reached after being doubled as many times as possible without exceeding `k`, or 2 if doubling did not occur.

So, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is the new integer input provided by the user**.
