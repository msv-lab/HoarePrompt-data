Output State: **`l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer, `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`.**

The code assigns the value of `k` to `k0`, which means `k0` now holds the same value as `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
