Postcondition: `ans` is the maximum value between its current value (0) and `i` if `n` is less than or equal to `x` divided by `i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0, and `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^3, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^8, and there exists an integer `i` such that `x` % `i` == 0.
