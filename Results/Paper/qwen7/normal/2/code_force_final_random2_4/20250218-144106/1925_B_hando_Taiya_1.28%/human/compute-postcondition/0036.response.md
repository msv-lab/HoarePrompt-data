Output State: **`ans` is the maximum value among all `i` such that `x % i == 0` and `n` is less than or equal to `x // i` during the loop's iterations.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `ans` will hold the maximum value of `i` for which both conditions (`x % i == 0` and `n <= x // i`) are satisfied during any iteration of the loop. The loop iterates over all possible divisors of `x` up to `isqrt(x)`, updating `ans` with the maximum valid `i` found. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `n`) retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop, but since they are not used in determining the final value of `ans`, they do not affect the output state description.
