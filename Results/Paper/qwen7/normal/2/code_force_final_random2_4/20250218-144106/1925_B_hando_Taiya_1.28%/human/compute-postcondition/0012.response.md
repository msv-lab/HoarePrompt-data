Postcondition: `ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8, there exists an integer `i` such that x % i == 0, and `n` is greater than x // i. If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of its current value (which is 0) and `x // i`.
