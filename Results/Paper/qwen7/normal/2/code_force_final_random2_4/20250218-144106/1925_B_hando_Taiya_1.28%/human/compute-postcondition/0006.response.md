Output State: **`ans` is the maximum value between its current value (0) and `i`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8, there exists an integer `i` such that x % i == 0, and `n` is less than or equal to x divided by i.**

Explanation: The line `ans = max(ans, i)` updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum of its current value (`0`) and the value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
