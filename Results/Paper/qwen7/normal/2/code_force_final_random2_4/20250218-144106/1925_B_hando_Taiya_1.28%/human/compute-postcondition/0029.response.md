Output State: **`ans` is the maximum of its original value (0) and `x // (i + 1)`; `i` is incremented by 1 to become `i + 1`; `n` is `x // (i + 1)`**.

Explanation: The code updates `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and `x // i`, where `i` is incremented by 1. Since `n` is defined as `x // (i + 1)`, it also gets updated to this new value. The initial conditions for `ans`, `t`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged except for the modifications mentioned.
