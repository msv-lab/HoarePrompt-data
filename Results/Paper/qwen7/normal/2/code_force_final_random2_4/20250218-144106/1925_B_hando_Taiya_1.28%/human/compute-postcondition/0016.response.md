Postcondition: `ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8. There exists an integer `i` such that x % i == 0. If `n` is less than or equal to x divided by i, then `ans` is set to the maximum of its current value (0) and `i`. If `n` is greater than x // i, then `ans` remains 0.
