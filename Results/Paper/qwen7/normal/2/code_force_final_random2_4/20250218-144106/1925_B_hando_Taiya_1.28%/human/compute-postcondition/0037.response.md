Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` is the maximum value among all `i` such that `x % i == 0` and `n` is less than or equal to `x // i` during the loop's iterations.

To determine what will be printed, let's break down the conditions:

1. `x % i == 0` means `i` is a divisor of `x`.
2. `n` must be less than or equal to `x // i`.

Given these conditions, `ans` is the largest `i` that satisfies both conditions during the loop's execution.

Since the exact value of `x` and the loop iterations are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we know it is the maximum value that meets the criteria.

Output: **ans (where ans is the maximum value of i such that x % i == 0 and n <= x // i)**
