Postcondition: `ans` is the maximum of its original value (0) and `i` if `x % i == 0` and `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\), `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` is \(x // i\).
