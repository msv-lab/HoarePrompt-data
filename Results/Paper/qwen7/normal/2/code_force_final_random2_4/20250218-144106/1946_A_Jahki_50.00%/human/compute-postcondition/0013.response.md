Output State: **`op` is 0, `num` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the input string, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, and `num2` is less than or equal to 10000.**

Explanation: The code `b = sorted(a)` sorts the list `a` (which contains integers from `case.split()`) into a new list `b`. The sorting does not affect the other variables, so they remain in their initial or previously described states.
