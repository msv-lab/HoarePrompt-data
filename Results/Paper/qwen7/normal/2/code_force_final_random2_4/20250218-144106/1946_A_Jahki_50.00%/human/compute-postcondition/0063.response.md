The code `new_median = b[ma]` assigns the value at index `ma` in the list `b` to the variable `new_median`. Given the initial state, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, and `ma` is defined as `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `num2 // 2`. Since `new_median` must be less than `median`, and `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, `new_median` will be the same as `median` if `num2` is odd, or the element before `median` if `num2` is even.

Output State: **`op` is 1, `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `total` is 0, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits converted to integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `num2 // 2`, `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in list `b`, `b` is sorted.**
