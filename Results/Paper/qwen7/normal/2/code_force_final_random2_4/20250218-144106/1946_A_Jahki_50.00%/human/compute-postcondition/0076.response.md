Based on the initial state provided:

- `op` is incremented multiple times until `new_median` becomes greater than `median`.
- `total` remains 0.
- `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits converted to integers.
- `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a` such that `new_median` is greater than `median`.
- `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`.
- `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `num2 // 2`.
- `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in list `b`.
- `b[ma]` is increased by 1 with each iteration where `new_median` is less than or equal to `median`.

The loop continues until `new_median` becomes greater than `median`. Each iteration increments `op` by 1 and increases `b[ma]` by 1, updating `new_median` to the current value of `b[ma]`.

Since the exact values of `median`, `num2`, and the contents of `a` and `b` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact number of iterations. However, we know that `op` is incremented each time the condition `new_median <= median` is true, and the loop stops when `new_median` becomes greater than `median`.

Therefore, the value of `op` will be the number of iterations it took for `new_median` to become greater than `median`.

Output: **op (the number of iterations it took for new_median to become greater than median)**
