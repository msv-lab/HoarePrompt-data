Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, an integer `n` representing the length of the array `a`, and an array `a` of `n` integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9]. It returns the results for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple scenarios (test cases) where it first takes an integer `t` indicating how many test cases to process. For each test case, it then takes an integer `n` which specifies the length of an array `a`, and the array `a` itself containing `n` integers within the specified range. The function processes each test case and returns the results accordingly.
