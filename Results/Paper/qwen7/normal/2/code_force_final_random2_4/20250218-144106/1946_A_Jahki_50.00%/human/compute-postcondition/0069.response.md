Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `new_median <= median`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `op` is incremented by 1.
   - `total` is 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits converted to integers.
   - `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`.
   - `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`.
   - `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `num2 // 2`.
   - `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in list `b`.

3. **Determine which states need to be adjusted**:
   - The loop condition depends on `new_median` and `median`.
   - For the loop to continue, `new_median` must be less than or equal to `median`.
   - Since `new_median` is determined by the state of `b` (which is sorted), and `b` is based on `a`, we need to ensure that the loop can continue by adjusting the values of `a` or `b` such that `new_median` remains less than or equal to `median`.

4. **Adjusting the states**:
   - We need to ensure that `new_median` is still less than or equal to `median` for the next iteration.
   - This can be achieved by either changing the elements in `a` or ensuring that the sorting of `b` maintains the condition.

Given that the only way to directly affect `new_median` and `median` is through the list `b`, we need to ensure that the elements in `b` are such that `new_median` remains less than or equal to `median`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we cannot specify exact values, but we can ensure that the condition holds true by keeping `new_median` less than or equal to `median`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the list `b` such that `new_median` remains less than or equal to `median`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`op` is incremented by 1, `total` is 0, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits converted to integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a` such that `new_median` is less than or equal to `median`, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, `ma` is `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is `num2 // 2`, `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in list `b`**
