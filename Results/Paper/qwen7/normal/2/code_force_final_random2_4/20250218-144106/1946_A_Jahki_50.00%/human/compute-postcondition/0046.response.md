Output State: **`op` is 3, `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `total` is 0, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, and `new_median` is equal to `b[ma]`, where `ma` is an integer equal to `num2 / 2`.**

Explanation: The code `case = input()` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `case`. All other variables remain unchanged. The new value of `case` is an input string provided by the user, while the other variables retain their initial or previously calculated states.
