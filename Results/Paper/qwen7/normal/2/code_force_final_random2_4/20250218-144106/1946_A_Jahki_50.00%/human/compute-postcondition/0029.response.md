Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `new_median <= median`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total` is 0
   - `i` is 0
   - `num2` is an integer less than or equal to 10000
   - `case` is a string
   - `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits
   - `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`
   - `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`
   - `new_median` is equal to `median`
   - `ma` is an integer equal to `num2 / 2`
   - `b` is now a sorted version of the original `b` list

3. **Determine which variables affect the loop condition**:
   - The loop condition depends on `new_median` and `median`.
   - Since `new_median` is equal to `median` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop will continue if `median` changes such that `new_median` becomes greater than `median`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `new_median` must become greater than `median`. This means `median` must change to a value that makes `new_median > median`.
   - The only way `median` can change is through the sorting process or through modifications to the list `b`. However, since `b` is already sorted and `new_median` is equal to `median`, no changes to `b` will directly change `median`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since `new_median` is equal to `median` and there are no operations within the loop body that would change `new_median` or `median`, the only way to proceed with the loop is to ensure that `new_median` becomes greater than `median` before entering the loop.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `new_median` must be greater than `median`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`total` is 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an integer less than or equal to 10000, `case` is a string, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, `new_median` must be greater than `median`, `ma` is an integer equal to `num2 / 2`, and `b` is now a sorted version of the original `b` list.**
