Output State: **`op` is 0, `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `total` is 0, `a` is a list of integers from `case.split()` that are digits, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `median` is the element at index `num2 / 2` in list `b`, and `new_median` is equal to `b[ma]`, where `ma` is an integer equal to `num2 / 2`.**

Explanation: The line `op = 0` changes the value of `op` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
