Based on the initial state provided:

- `casos` must be greater than 0.
- `c` is `c + 1`, but since the initial value of `c` is not specified, we only know that after this operation, `c` will be incremented by 1.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 20\).
- `n` is an integer input.

The print statement is simply:

```python
print('..##..##')
```

This statement will print the exact string `'..##..##'`.

Output: **'..##..##'**
