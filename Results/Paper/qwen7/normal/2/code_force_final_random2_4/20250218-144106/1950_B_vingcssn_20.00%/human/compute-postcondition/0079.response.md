Output: **##..##..**

Explanation: The initial state provides us with the following information:
- `casos` must be greater than 0.
- `c` is assigned the value of `c + 1`, but since `c` is not initialized or given any explicit value, it is not relevant to the print statement.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 20\).
- `n` is an integer input, but it is not used in the print statement.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'##..##..'`. Since no variables are explicitly printed and the values of `c` and `n` do not affect the output, the only thing printed is the string `'##..##..'`.
