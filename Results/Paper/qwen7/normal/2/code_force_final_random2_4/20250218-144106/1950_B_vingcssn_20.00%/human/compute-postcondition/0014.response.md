Based on the initial state provided:

- `casos` must be greater than 0.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 20\).
- `n` is 3.
- \(n \neq 2\).

The print statement simply outputs the string `##..##`.

Since none of the variables mentioned in the print statement (`casos`, `t`, `n`) are used in the print statement itself, they do not affect the output. The output is solely determined by the string literal provided in the print statement.

Output: **##..##**
