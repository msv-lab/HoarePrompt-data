Reasoning:
- The program correctly handles the input of multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20).
- The program prints the correct patterns for `n = 1, 2, 3, 4` as specified in the problem description.
- However, the program does not handle the general case for `n > 4`. It only provides hardcoded patterns for `n = 1, 2, 3, 4` and prints "No esta en el rango" for any other value of `n`.
- According to the problem statement, the program should generate a 2n × 2n checkerboard for any valid `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), not just the hardcoded patterns.

Given the problem statement requires generating a 2n × 2n checkerboard for any valid `n`, the current implementation is incomplete and incorrect for `n > 4`.

Correctness: **False**
