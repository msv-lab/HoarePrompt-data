Based on the initial state provided:

- `casos` must be greater than 0.
- `c` is `c + 1`, but the value of `c` before this operation is not specified.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 20\).
- `n` is an integer input.

The print statement is simply printing the string `'##..##'`.

Since none of the variables `c`, `t`, or `n` are used in the print statement, and their values do not affect the output, the only thing being printed is the string `'##..##'`.

Output: **'##..##'**
