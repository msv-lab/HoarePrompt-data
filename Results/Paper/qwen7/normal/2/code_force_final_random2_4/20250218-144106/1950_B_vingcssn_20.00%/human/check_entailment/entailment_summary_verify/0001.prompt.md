You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . Output a 2n \times 2n checkerboard made of 2
\times 2 squares alternating '\texttt{#} ' and '\texttt{.} ', with the top-
left cell being '\texttt{#} '.

The picture above shows the answers for n=1,2,3,4 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 20 ) — the number of test
cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 20
) — it means you need to output a checkerboard of side length 2n .

Output

For each test case, output 2n lines, each containing 2n characters without
spaces — the checkerboard, as described in the statement. Do not output empty
lines between test cases.

- Program:
def func():
    casos = int(input())
    for c in range(0, casos):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('##')
            print('##')
        elif n == 2:
            print('##..')
            print('##..')
            print('..##')
            print('..##')
        elif n == 3:
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
            print('..##..')
            print('..##..')
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
        elif n == 4:
            print('##..##..')
            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')
            print('..##..##')
            print('##..##..')
            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')
            print('..##..##')
        else:
            print('No esta en el rango')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20). For each `n`, it prints a specific pattern consisting of `#` and `.` characters. If `n` is outside the specified range, it prints "No esta en el rango". After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but outputs the patterns or the error message for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step:

1. The function `func()` reads the number of test cases (`casos`) from input.
2. It then iterates over each test case using a loop.
3. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`.
4. The program checks specific values of `n` (1, 2, 3, 4) and prints the corresponding 2x2, 4x4, 6x6, and 8x8 checkerboards respectively.
5. If `n` does not match any of the specified values, it prints "No esta en el rango" (which means "Not in the range" in Spanish).

Now, let's consider the requirements of the problem:
- We need to generate a 2n x 2n checkerboard.
- The top-left cell should be '#'.
- The pattern should alternate between '#' and '.'.
- The checkerboard should be generated for any `n` within the range 1 to 20.

The program only handles specific cases (n = 1, 2, 3, 4) and does not provide a general solution for any `n` within the required range. Therefore, it fails to meet the problem's requirements for arbitrary values of `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program is not correct because it does not handle all possible values of `n` within the specified range.

Correctness: **False**
