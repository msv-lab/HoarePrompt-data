Output State: `casos` is decremented by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0, `c` equals `casos` after all iterations, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 20\), and `n` is an integer input for each iteration from the user. After all iterations, the loop will have printed patterns based on the value of `n` for each iteration, and `casos` will be 0.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `casos` will be 0 (since it starts as an input integer between 1 and 20 and is decremented by 1 each time through the loop), `c` will equal the original value of `casos` (as it is incremented once per iteration), `t` remains unchanged as it was not modified within the loop, and `n` represents the integer inputs provided by the user for each iteration of the loop. The loop will have printed the corresponding patterns based on the value of `n` for each iteration.
