Output State: **`casos` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 20\), `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `n` and converts it to an integer. The conditions for `casos` and `t` remain unchanged.
