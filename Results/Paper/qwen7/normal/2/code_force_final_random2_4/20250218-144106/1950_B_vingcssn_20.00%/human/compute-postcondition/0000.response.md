Output State: **`casos` is an input integer and 1 ≤ `casos` ≤ 20, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 20.**

Explanation: The code `casos = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `casos`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still holds an integer value within the range 1 to 20. The new variable `casos` is now an integer input from the user, and it also falls within the specified range.
