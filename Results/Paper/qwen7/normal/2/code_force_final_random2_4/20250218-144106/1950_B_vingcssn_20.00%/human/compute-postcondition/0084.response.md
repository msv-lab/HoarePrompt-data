Based on the initial state provided:

- `casos` must be greater than 0.
- `c` is `c + 1`, but since `c` is not explicitly defined, we can infer that `c` is being incremented by 1, but its exact value is not needed to determine the output.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 20\).
- `n` is an integer input.

The `print` statement simply outputs a string `##..##..`.

Since none of the variables (`c`, `t`, or `n`) are used in the `print` statement, and the only thing being printed is the string `##..##..`, the output will be exactly that string.

Output: **##..##..**
