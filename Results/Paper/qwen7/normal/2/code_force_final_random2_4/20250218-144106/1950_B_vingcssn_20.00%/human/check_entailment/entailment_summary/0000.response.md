Reasoning:
The provided program is designed to generate a 2n Ã— 2n checkerboard pattern for given values of `n`. The program correctly handles the cases for `n = 1, 2, 3, 4` as specified in the problem description. However, the program does not generalize the pattern for any `n` beyond these specific cases. Instead, it includes a default case that prints "No esta en el rango" (which translates to "Not in the range") for any `n` outside the range 1 to 4. This is not aligned with the problem statement, which requires the program to handle any `n` within the range 1 to 20.

To correct this, the program should generate the checkerboard pattern for any `n` within the specified range, using a loop to construct the pattern dynamically rather than hard-coding each case.

Given the current implementation, the program does not correctly handle the general case for `n` beyond 4, which violates the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**
