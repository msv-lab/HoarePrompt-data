Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `c` in the range `range(0, casos)`. This means the loop variable `c` will take values from 0 to `casos-1`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `c < casos`. 

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `casos` must be greater than 0.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 20\).
   - `n` is an input integer.

4. **Adjusting the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `c` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `c` would be one less than its value at the start of the current iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `c` must be less than `casos`.
   - Therefore, `c` should be set to `c + 1` for the next iteration.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `casos` remains unchanged because it is the upper limit of the loop and does not change within the loop.
   - `t` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`casos` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 20\), and `c` is `c + 1` (one more than the value at the end of the previous iteration)**.
