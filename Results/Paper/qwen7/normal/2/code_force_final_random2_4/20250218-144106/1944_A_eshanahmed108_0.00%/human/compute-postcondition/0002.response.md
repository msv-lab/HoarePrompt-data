To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(n if n - k <= 1 else 1)
   ```

This print statement uses a conditional expression (ternary operator). It checks the condition `n - k <= 1`:
- If the condition is true, it prints `n`.
- If the condition is false, it prints `1`.

Let's analyze the condition `n - k <= 1`:
- If `n - k` is less than or equal to 1, then `n` will be printed.
- Otherwise, `1` will be printed.

Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not specified, we need to consider the general case based on the condition.

### Possible Scenarios:
- **Scenario 1:** If `n - k <= 1` is true, then `n` will be printed.
- **Scenario 2:** If `n - k > 1` is true, then `1` will be printed.

Given the general nature of the problem, without specific values for `n` and `k`, the most precise answer we can give is based on the condition.

### Final Output:
Output: **n if n - k <= 1 else 1**
