Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `k` is greater than or equal to `n-1`. In such a case, destroying `k` bridges would leave Everule unable to reach any island except his own (island 1). However, the current implementation always prints 1 or n based on the condition `n - k <= 1`, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the input:
```
4 3
```
Here, `n = 4` and `k = 3`. Since `k` is 3, destroying 3 bridges would leave Everule unable to reach any other island except island 1. Therefore, the correct output should be `1`, but the program incorrectly outputs `4`.

To fix this, the program should check if `k >= n - 1` and handle this case appropriately.
