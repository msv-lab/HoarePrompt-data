Output State: The loop will execute exactly `t` times, where `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\). After all iterations, for each iteration, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, and the condition `n - k <= 1` is checked. If the condition is true, `n` is printed; otherwise, `1` is printed.

This means that after all the iterations, the final output will be a series of numbers, either `n` or `1`, depending on whether `n - k <= 1` was true for each pair of inputs `(n, k)`.
