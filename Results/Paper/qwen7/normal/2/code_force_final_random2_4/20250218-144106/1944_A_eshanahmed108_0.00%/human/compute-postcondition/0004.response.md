Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, and `num_iterations` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `num_iterations` is not affected by this code. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer within the specified range, `n` and `k` are the integers entered by the user, and `num_iterations` must still be greater than 0.
