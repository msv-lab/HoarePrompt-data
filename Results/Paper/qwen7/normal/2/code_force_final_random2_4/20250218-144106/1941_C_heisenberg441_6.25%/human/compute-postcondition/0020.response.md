Output State: **`ans` is the total number of times the substring 'map' was found and removed from the original string `s` plus 2, `s` now does not contain the substring 'pie', and the substring 'pie' has been replaced with an empty string.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is incremented by 1, so it now represents the total number of times the substring 'map' was found and removed from the original string `s` plus 2. All other conditions remain unchanged.
