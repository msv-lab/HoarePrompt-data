Output State: **`ans` is the total number of times the substring 'map' was found and removed from the original string `s` plus 3, `s` is the original string `s` without the substring 'pie' starting from the first occurrence of 'pie' and including the next two characters.**

Explanation: The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, so it now represents the total number of times the substring 'map' was found and removed from the original string `s` plus 3. The value of `s` remains unchanged as the code does not modify the string `s`.
