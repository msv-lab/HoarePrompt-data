### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to determine the minimum number of characters to remove from a string `s` to make it "beautiful". A string is "beautiful" if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `s`.
   - It calls the function `func_1(s)` and prints the result.
   
3. **Function `func_1(s)` Analysis**:
   - The function checks if the string `s` is exactly "mapie". If true, it returns 1, which is incorrect because "mapie" should be removed completely, not just one character.
   - The function initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the number of deletions.
   - It uses two while loops to find and remove occurrences of "map" and "pie":
     - For "map": It finds the first occurrence of "map" and removes it by slicing the string before and after "map".
     - For "pie": It finds the first occurrence of "pie" and removes it similarly.
   - Each time a substring is found and removed, `ans` is incremented.

4. **Issues Identified**:
   - The check `if s == 'mapie':` is unnecessary and incorrect. This condition should be handled by the removal logic.
   - The function correctly removes "map" and "pie" but does not handle the case where both substrings might overlap or appear multiple times efficiently.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The function logic is almost correct but needs a more robust approach to ensure all occurrences of "map" and "pie" are removed efficiently without redundant checks.

### Conclusion:
The given program is almost correct but has an unnecessary check and could be optimized further. However, the core logic of finding and removing "map" and "pie" is sound.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
