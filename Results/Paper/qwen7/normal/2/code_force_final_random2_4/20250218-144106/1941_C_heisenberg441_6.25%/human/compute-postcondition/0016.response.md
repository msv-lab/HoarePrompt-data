Output State: **`ans` is the total number of times the substring 'map' was found and removed from the original string `s`, and `s` now does not contain the substring 'pie'**.

Explanation: The code replaces the substring 'pie' in `s` with an empty string, effectively removing 'pie' from `s`. Since `ans` is the count of times 'map' was found and removed, and the removal of 'pie' does not affect the count of 'map', `ans` remains unchanged. However, `s` no longer contains the substring 'pie'.
