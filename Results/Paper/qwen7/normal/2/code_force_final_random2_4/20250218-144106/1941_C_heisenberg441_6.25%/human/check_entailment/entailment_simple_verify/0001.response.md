### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to determine the minimum number of characters to remove from a string `s` to make it "beautiful". A string is "beautiful" if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `s`.
   - It calls the function `func_1(s)` and prints the result.
   
3. **Function `func_1(s)` Analysis**:
   - The function checks if the string `s` is exactly "mapie". This check is unnecessary and incorrect because "mapie" should be removed completely, not just one character.
   - The function initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the number of deletions.
   - It uses two while loops to find and remove occurrences of "map" and "pie":
     - For "map": It finds the first occurrence of "map" and removes it by slicing the string before and after "map".
     - For "pie": It finds the first occurrence of "pie" and removes it similarly.
   - Each time a substring is found and removed, `ans` is incremented.

4. **Issues Identified**:
   - The check `if s == 'mapie':` is unnecessary and incorrect. This condition should be handled by the removal logic.
   - The function correctly removes "map" and "pie" but does not handle the case where both substrings might overlap or appear multiple times efficiently.
   - The function does not account for the possibility that removing "map" might create new occurrences of "pie" or vice versa.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The function logic is flawed because it does not handle overlapping or multiple occurrences of "map" and "pie" correctly. For example, in the string "mapmap", the function would only remove one "map" and then continue searching for "pie", missing the second "map".
   - The function also does not account for the fact that removing "map" or "pie" might create new instances of the other substring, leading to incorrect counts.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not handle overlapping or multiple occurrences of "map" and "pie" correctly. The function logic is flawed and does not ensure the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the issues identified in the reasoning above.
