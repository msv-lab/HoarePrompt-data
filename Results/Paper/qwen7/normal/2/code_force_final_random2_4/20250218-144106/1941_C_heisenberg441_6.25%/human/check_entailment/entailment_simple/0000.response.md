Reasoning:

1. The annotated program correctly identifies the need to remove the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful.
2. It checks for the substrings "map" and "pie" separately and removes them iteratively until no more occurrences are found.
3. The logic for removing "map" and "pie" is sound and ensures that the string is shortened by the minimum number of characters necessary to eliminate both substrings.
4. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the number of deletions required and returns this value.

Given the above points, the annotated program appears to be logically sound and should work as intended for the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
