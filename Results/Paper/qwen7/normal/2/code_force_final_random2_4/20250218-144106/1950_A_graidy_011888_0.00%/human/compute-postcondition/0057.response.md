Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` must be less than or equal to 1000.
- `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9.
- `y` is a new random integer between 1 and 9.
- `z` is a new random integer between 1 and 9.
- `res` is determined by the conditions involving `x`, `y`, and `z`.

The `print(x, y, z, sep=' ')` statement will print the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` separated by a space. Since `x`, `y`, and `z` are random integers between 1 and 9, their exact values are not known but they will be three integers within this range.

Output: **x y z (where x, y, and z are random integers between 1 and 9)**
