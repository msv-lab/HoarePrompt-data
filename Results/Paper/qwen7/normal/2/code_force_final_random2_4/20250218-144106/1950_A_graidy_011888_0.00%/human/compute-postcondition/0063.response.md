Functionality: **The function generates 1000 sets of three random integers (x, y, z) each ranging from 1 to 9. For each set, it determines whether the relationship between x, y, and z forms a 'peak', 'stair', or 'none' pattern based on specific conditions. It then prints each set of integers followed by the determined pattern. After completing 1000 iterations, the function does not return any value but outputs the results of all iterations.**
