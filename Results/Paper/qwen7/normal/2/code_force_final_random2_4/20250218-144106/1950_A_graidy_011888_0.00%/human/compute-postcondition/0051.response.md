Output State: **`i` must be less than or equal to 1000, `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9, `y` is a new random integer between 1 and 9, `z` is a new random integer between 1 and 9, `res` is 'none', `x` is a new random integer between 1 and 9, `z` is a new random integer between 1 and 9**.

Explanation: The line `res = 'none'` assigns the string `'none'` to the variable `res`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the constraints and values of `i`, `x`, `y`, `z`, and the second occurrence of `x` and `z` remain the same as they were initially.
