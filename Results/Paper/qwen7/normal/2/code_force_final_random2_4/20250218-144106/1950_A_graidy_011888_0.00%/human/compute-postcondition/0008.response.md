Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9, `y` is a random integer between 1 and 9, `z` is a random integer between 1 and 9, and `res` is 'peak'**.

The variable `res` is assigned the string `'peak'`. The values of `i`, `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition that the current value of `y` is greater than the current value of `z` is still valid.
