#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        
        y = randint(1, 9)
        
        z = randint(1, 9)
        
        res = ''
        
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        
        print(res)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is 1001, `x` is a random integer between 1 and 9, `y` is a random integer between 1 and 9, `z` is a random integer between 1 and 9, and `res` is either 'peak', 'stair', or 'none'.
    #
    #After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `i` will be 1001 because the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, starting from 1. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` will be randomly generated integers between 1 and 9 for the last iteration of the loop, and the value of `res` will be determined based on the conditions provided in the loop body for the last set of `x`, `y`, and `z` values.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function generates 1000 sets of three random integers (x, y, z) each ranging from 1 to 9. For each set, it determines whether the relationship between x, y, and z forms a 'peak', 'stair', or 'none' pattern based on specific conditions. It then prints each set of integers followed by the determined pattern. After completing 1000 iterations, the function does not return any value but outputs the results of all iterations.
