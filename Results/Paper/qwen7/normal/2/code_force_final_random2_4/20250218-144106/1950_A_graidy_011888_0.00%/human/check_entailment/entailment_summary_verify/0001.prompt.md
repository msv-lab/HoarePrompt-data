You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
from random import randint

def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        y = randint(1, 9)
        z = randint(1, 9)
        res = ''
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        print(res)
        i += 1



- Function Summary: 
The function generates 1000 sets of three random integers (x, y, z) each ranging from 1 to 9. For each set, it determines whether the relationship between x, y, and z forms a 'peak', 'stair', or 'none' pattern based on specific conditions. It then prints each set of integers followed by the determined pattern. After completing 1000 iterations, the function does not return any value but outputs the results of all iterations.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to determine whether three given digits \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) form a stair, a peak, or neither based on specific conditions.
2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program uses a `while` loop that runs indefinitely (`i <= 1000`) and generates random numbers for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) within the range [1, 9].
   - It checks the conditions for a peak and a stair but does not match the input format specified in the problem statement.
   - The program prints random values and their corresponding results, which do not correspond to the input test cases provided.
   - The program does not read any input from the user; it generates random numbers internally.
   - The program does not handle the number of test cases (`t`) or the actual input values as specified in the problem statement.

3. **Expected Behavior**:
   - The program should read the number of test cases and then process each test case by reading three digits.
   - For each set of three digits, it should check the conditions for a stair or a peak and print the appropriate result.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the solution as per the problem description. It generates random numbers and prints them without processing the actual input as required.
