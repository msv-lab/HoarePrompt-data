Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of \(n\) positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) where \(1 \leq i \leq n\), `l` is equal to `l + 1`, `r` is equal to `n - 2` if `l == r` and `k >= a[r]`, otherwise `r` remains unchanged, `sunks` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l != r`, no changes occur to `t`, `r`, and `sunks` remains unchanged, and `l` is increased by 1, and we continue the loop.
