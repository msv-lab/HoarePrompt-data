Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is n - 1, `sunks` is `1`, and the value of `a[l]` is less than or equal to the value of `a[r]`. Additionally, `k` is less than `a[l] * 2`. The current value of `k` is `a[l] * 2 - 1`**.

Explanation: The line `sunks += 1` increments the value of `sunks` by 1. Given that `sunks` was initially either 0 or 1 depending on whether `k` was greater than or equal to `a[r]`, after this operation, `sunks` will be 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
