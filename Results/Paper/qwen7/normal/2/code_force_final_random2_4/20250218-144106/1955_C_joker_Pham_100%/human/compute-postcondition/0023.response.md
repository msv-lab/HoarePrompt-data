Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is now n - 2, `sunks` is equal to `sunks + 1`, and the value of `a[r]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. Initially, `r` was equal to `n - 1`. After decrementing, `r` becomes `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
