Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of \(n\) positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) where \(1 \leq i \leq n\), `l` is equal to `l + 1`, `r` remains unchanged, `sunks` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the innermost loop or if statement. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, and `r` remain as they were before the statement was executed, except for `l` which is incremented by 1. `sunks` is increased by 1, and the loop or if statement is exited.
