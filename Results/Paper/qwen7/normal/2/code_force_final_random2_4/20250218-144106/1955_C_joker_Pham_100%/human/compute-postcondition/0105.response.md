The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the given code snippet, the variables `l`, `r`, and `sunks` are simply updated as described in the initial state without being affected by a loop. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged because they are not modified in the given code.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15} - 2 \cdot a[r]\), `a` is a list of \(n\) positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) where \(1 \leq i \leq n\), `l` is equal to `l + 1`, `r` is decreased by 1, `sunks` is increased by 1.**
