Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\) decreased by `a[l] * 2`, `a` is a list of \(n\) positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) where \(1 \leq i \leq n\), `l` is incremented by 1, `r` is decremented by 1, `sunks` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The line `sunks += 1` increments the variable `sunks` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `sunks` is now one more than its original value, while `l` is incremented by 1 and `r` is decremented by 1.
