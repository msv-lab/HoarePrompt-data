Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) where \(1 \leq i \leq n\), `l` is incremented by either 1 or 2 depending on the condition, `r` is either unchanged or decremented by 1, `sunks` is increased by at least 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[r] < a[l]` and `k >= a[r] * 2`, then `l` is incremented by 1 or 2, `r` is decremented by 1, `sunks` is increased by 2, and `a[l]` is decreased by `a[r]`. Otherwise, `l` is incremented by 1 or 2, `r` is unchanged or decremented by 1, and `sunks` is increased by 1.
