Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\) decreased by `a[l] * 2`, `a` is a list of \(n\) positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) where \(1 \leq i \leq n\), `l` is equal to `l + 1`, `r` is equal to `n - 2`, `sunks` is increased by 1, `a[r]` is decreased by `a[l]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l == r`, then if \(k \geq a[r]\), `t` remains unchanged, `r` remains unchanged, and `sunks` is increased by 1. If `l != r`, no changes occur to `t`, `r`, and `sunks` remains unchanged.**
