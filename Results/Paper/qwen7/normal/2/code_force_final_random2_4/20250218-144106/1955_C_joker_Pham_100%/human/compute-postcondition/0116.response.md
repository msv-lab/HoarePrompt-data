Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of \(n\) positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) where \(1 \leq i \leq n\), `l` is `l + 1`, `r` is `r - 1` if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r] * 2` else `r` remains unchanged, `sunks` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement. This means that the operations inside the loop or if statement are not executed further. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `sunks`, `l`, and `r` are updated according to the given conditions before the `break` statement was encountered. Specifically, `l` is incremented by 1, `sunks` is increased by 1, and the condition for updating `r` is checked but not executed further due to the `break`.
