Output State: **Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of \(n\) positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) where \(1 \leq i \leq n\), `l` is `l + 1`, `r` is unchanged, `sunks` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` remain as per their postconditions, with `l` being incremented by 1 and `sunks` increased by 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
