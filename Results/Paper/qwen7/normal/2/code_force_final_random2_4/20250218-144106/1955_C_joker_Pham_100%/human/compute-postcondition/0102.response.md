Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15} - 2 \cdot a[r]\), `a` is a list of \(n\) positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) where \(1 \leq i \leq n\), `l` is equal to `l + 1`, `r` remains unchanged, `sunks` is increased by 1, and `a[l]` is decreased by `a[r]`. If `a[l]` is not zero, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.**
