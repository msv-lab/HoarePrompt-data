Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (a positive integer), k (a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), and a (a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n). It returns the total count of how many times the specified conditions within the loop were met during the entire execution of the loop.**
