Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `l` is equal to `r`, `r` is n - 1, `sunks` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, and the value of `a[l]` is less than or equal to the value of `a[r]`. Additionally, `k` is greater than or equal to twice the value of `a[l]`, and `k` is decreased by 2 times the value of `a[l]`**.

In more detail:
- `t` remains unchanged as it was a positive integer.
- `n` remains unchanged as it was a positive integer within the specified range.
- `k` is decreased by `2 * a[l]` because `k -= a[l] * 2`.
- `a` remains unchanged as no operations were performed on its elements.
- `l` remains unchanged as it is equal to `r`, which is `n - 1`.
- `r` remains unchanged as it is `n - 1`.
- `sunks` remains unchanged as it depends on whether `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`.
- The condition that `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]` remains true.
- The condition that `k` is greater than or equal to twice the value of `a[l]` remains true after the operation.
