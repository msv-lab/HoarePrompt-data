Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `l` is equal to `l + 1`, `r` is now `r - 1`, `sunks` is equal to `sunks + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `sunks` remain unchanged from their initial states. Additionally, the condition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement remains true.
