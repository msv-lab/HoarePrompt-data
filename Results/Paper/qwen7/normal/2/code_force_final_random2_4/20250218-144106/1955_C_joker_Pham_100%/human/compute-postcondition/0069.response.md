Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\), `a` is a list of \(n\) positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\) where \(1 \leq i \leq n\), `l` is equal to `l + 1`, `r` remains \(n - 1\) or \(n - 2\) or remains unchanged, `sunks` is equal to `sunks + 1` or `sunks + 2` or `sunks + 3` or remains 0, 1, or 2, and `sunks` is increased by 1.**

This means that the variable `sunks` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain in their previously described states.
