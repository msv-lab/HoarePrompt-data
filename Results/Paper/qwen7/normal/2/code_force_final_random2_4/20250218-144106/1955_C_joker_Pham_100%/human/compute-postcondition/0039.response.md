Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `l` is equal to `l + 1` or `r`, `r` is n - 1 or n - 2, `sunks` is equal to `sunks + 2` or remains 0 or 1, `k` is 0, the value of `a[r]` is 0 or the value of `a[l]` is less than or equal to the value of `a[r]`. Additionally, `k` is less than `a[l] * 2` in the else case. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
