Output State: **`i` is 2, `bets` must be greater than 1, `prod` is equal to `a[0] * a[1] * a[2]`**

Explanation: The code multiplies `prod` by `a[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, `prod` is updated to `a[0] * a[1] * a[2]`. The other variables (`i` and `bets`) remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
