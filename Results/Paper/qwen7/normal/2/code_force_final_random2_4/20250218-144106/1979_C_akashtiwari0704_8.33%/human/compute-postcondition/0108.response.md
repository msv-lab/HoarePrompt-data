Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0; `ans` is a string that has been appended with `str(a[i])` followed by a space.**

Explanation: The code `ans += str(a[i]) + ' '` appends the string `str(a[i])` followed by a space to the existing value of `ans`. The initial state of `bets` being greater than 0 is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, `bets` remains greater than 0, and `ans` now includes the string representation of `a[i]` followed by a space.
