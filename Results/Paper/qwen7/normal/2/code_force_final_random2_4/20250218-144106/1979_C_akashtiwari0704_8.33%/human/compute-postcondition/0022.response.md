Output State: **`sumo` is `prod // a[2] + int(a[2]) + int(a[3])`, `i` is 3**

Explanation: The code updates `sumo` by adding `int(a[i])`. Given that `i` is 3, `int(a[i])` is equivalent to `int(a[3])`. Therefore, `sumo` is updated to its previous value (`prod // a[2] + int(a[2])`) plus `int(a[3])`. The values of `i` and `a[3]` remain unchanged.
