Output State: `i` is equal to `bets`, `prod` is equal to the product of all elements in the list `a` from index 0 to `bets-1`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations (from `i=0` to `i=bets-1`), the variable `i` will be equal to `bets` because the loop increments `i` without changing it when `i` reaches `bets-1`. The variable `prod` will be the cumulative product of all elements in the list `a` from index 0 to `bets-1` because the loop multiplies `prod` by `a[i]` in each iteration.
