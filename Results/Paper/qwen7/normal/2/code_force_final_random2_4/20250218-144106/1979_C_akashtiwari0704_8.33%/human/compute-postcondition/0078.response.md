Postcondition: **`sumo` is the sum of all updated values of `a[i]` for each iteration where `i` is less than `bets`, `bets` is greater than 0, and `prod` is the product of all elements in the list `a` from index 0 to `bets-1`. If `sumo >= prod`, the condition holds true. Otherwise, `ans` is a string containing the values of `a[i]` followed by spaces for each `i` where `i` is less than `bets`, and `sumo` is the sum of all updated values of `a[i]` for each iteration.**
