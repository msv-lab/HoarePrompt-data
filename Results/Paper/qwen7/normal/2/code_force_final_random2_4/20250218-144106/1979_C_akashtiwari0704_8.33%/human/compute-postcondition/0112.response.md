Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `ans` is a string that has been appended with `str(a[i]) + ' '` followed by `str(a[i+1]) + ' '`.**

This means that the string `ans` has been further appended with `str(a[i])` followed by a space, and then `str(a[i+1])` followed by a space. The values of `bets` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states, and `ans` now includes the additional parts specified.
