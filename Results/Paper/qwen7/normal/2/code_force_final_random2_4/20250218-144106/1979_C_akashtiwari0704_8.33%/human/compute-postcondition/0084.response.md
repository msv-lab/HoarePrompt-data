Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0; `prod` is multiplied by `a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `prod *= a[i]` multiplies the current value of `prod` by the value of `a[i]`. Since the initial state only specifies that `bets` must be greater than 0 and does not provide any initial value for `prod` or `a[i]`, the only change is that `prod` is now the product of its original value (which could be anything) and `a[i]`. The condition that `bets` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
