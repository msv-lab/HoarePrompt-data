Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0, `prod` is updated to `prod * a[bets - 1] * a[i]`, `i` is `bets`**

Explanation: The code `prod *= a[i]` multiplies the current value of `prod` by the element `a[i]`. Given that `i` is equal to `bets`, the new value of `prod` becomes `prod * a[bets - 1] * a[i]` (which simplifies to `prod * a[bets - 1] * a[bets]` since `i` is `bets`). The conditions and values of other variables remain unchanged.
