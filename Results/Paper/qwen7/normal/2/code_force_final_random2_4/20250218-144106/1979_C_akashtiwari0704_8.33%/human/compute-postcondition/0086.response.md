Output State: **`bets` must be greater than 0; `prod` is multiplied by `a[i+1]` and updated to `prod * a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `prod *= a[i]` multiplies the current value of `prod` by `a[i]` and updates `prod` with the new value. The precondition that `bets` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged, and the condition that `prod` is multiplied by `a[i+1]` is not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state includes both the unchanged precondition and the updated value of `prod`.
