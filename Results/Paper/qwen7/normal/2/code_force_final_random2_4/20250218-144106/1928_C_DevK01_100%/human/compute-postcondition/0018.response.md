Postcondition: `i` is 1, `q` is an integer representing the position Vasya occupied in the line, `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling, `w` is the square root of `q` and must be greater than 1, the list `M` contains the elements `w` and `i`, and if `q` is divisible by `i` and `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `i` remains the same and `M` contains `i`.
