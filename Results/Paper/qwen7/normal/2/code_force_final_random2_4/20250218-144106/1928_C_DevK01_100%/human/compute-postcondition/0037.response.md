Postcondition: `i` is increased by 1 and is either equal to 4 or less than `x - 1`. If `i` is equal to 4, `M` is a list containing the value of `i`, which is 4. If `q // i >= x - 1`, then `M` is a list containing the value of `i` or `q // i`. `M` remains unchanged if `i` is not equal to 4 and `q // i < x - 1`.
