Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining the number of possible values of \( k \) given Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received during the settling process. The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The position \( n \) and the number \( x \) must satisfy certain conditions related to \( k \).
   - The function `func_1` is used to find all divisors of a specific value derived from \( n \) and \( x \).

3. **Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the square root of a value derived from \( q \) (which is \((y - 2) // 2\) or \((n - x) // 2\)) and checks for divisors within a certain range.
   - It correctly identifies potential values of \( k \) by checking if the divisors are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).

4. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program correctly calculates \( y = n + x \) and checks if \( y \) is even.
   - If \( y \) is odd, it prints 0 and continues to the next test case.
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` with appropriate arguments and prints the length of the resulting set.

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The solution handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately, such as when \( n \geq 3x - 2 \).

Given the execution summary and the detailed analysis, the program logic appears to be correct and aligns with the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
