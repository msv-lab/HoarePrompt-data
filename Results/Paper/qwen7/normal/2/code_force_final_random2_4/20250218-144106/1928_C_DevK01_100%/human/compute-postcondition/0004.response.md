Output State: **`q` is an integer representing the position Vasya occupied in the line, `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling, `w` is the square root of `q`, the list `M` contains the element `w`, and `w` is an integer and is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**

The code `M += [w]` appends the value of `w` (which is the square root of `q`) to the list `M`. Since `M` was initially an empty list, after executing this line, `M` now contains the single element `w`. All other variables remain unchanged.
