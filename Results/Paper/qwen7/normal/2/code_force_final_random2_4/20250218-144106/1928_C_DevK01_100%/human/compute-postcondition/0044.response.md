Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `q` (an integer representing the position in the line) and `x` (an integer representing the number Vasya received). It returns a list `M` containing `w` and all integers from 2 to `w` that divide `q` and meet certain conditions, along with any additional divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**
