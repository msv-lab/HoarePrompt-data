Output State: **`i` is increased by 1 and is less than `w`, `i` is now equal to 4, `M` is a list containing the value of `i`, which is 4.**

Explanation: Initially, `i` is increased by 1 and is less than `w`, and `i` is greater than 3. The code `M += [i]` appends the current value of `i` to the list `M`. Since `i` was increased by 1 and is now equal to 4 (as it was initially greater than 3), `M` becomes a list containing the value 4. The condition `i` is less than `w` remains unchanged, and `M` remains unchanged in terms of its condition but now contains the value of `i`.
