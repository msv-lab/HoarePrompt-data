Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `r` is an input string, `g` is 0, `v1` is 0, and `prev` remains unchanged (still 0)**.

The code simply assigns the value 0 to `v1`, which does not affect any of the other variables. Therefore, their values remain the same as the initial state.
