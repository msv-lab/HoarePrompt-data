Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state after the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an integer greater than 4.
   - `r` is an input string.
   - If `r` is equal to '>', then `prev` is set to 1. Otherwise, there is no change in the value of `prev`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
   - After the previous iteration, `i` is 1, so for the loop to continue, `i` (which is now 1) must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, after the first iteration, `i` becomes 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 4.

5. **Consider the postcondition for `r` and `prev`**:
   - The value of `r` and `prev` does not affect the loop continuation condition directly. Therefore, they remain unchanged for the purpose of adjusting the loop head states.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `i` and `n`.

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `r` is an input string, and if `r` is equal to '>', then `prev` is set to 1**.
