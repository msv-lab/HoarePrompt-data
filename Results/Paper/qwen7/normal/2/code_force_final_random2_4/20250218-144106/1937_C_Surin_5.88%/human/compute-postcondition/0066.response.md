Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `v2` is 3**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change the values of any variables. It only flushes the output buffer, ensuring that any previously printed output is actually displayed. Since no variables are affected, their values remain the same as in the initial state.
