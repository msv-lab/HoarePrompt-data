Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `r` is the input string, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n - 1`, `v2` is `n - 1`, and `prev` is 1, `r` is an input string from the user.**

The code `r = input()` assigns the value entered by the user as a string to the variable `r`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
