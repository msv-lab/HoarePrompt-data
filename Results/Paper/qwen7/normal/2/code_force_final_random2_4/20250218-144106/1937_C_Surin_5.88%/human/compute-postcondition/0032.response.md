Output State: **`prev` is 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `v2` is `n-1`, and `v1` retains its last value which is 3 if `r` was '<' during any iteration.**

Explanation: The code initializes `prev` to 0. This assignment does not affect the values of `i`, `v2`, or `v1`. Therefore, their values remain as they were in the initial state, with the condition that `v1` retains its last value which is 3 if `r` was '<' during any iteration.
