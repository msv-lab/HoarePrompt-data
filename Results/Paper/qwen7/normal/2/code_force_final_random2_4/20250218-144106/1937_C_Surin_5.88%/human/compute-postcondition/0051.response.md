Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is an input string, and if the current value of `r` is equal to '>', then `prev` is 2; otherwise, `prev` remains unchanged.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables or change their values. It only flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all pending output is written to the standard output. Since no variables are modified or their values changed by this operation, the initial conditions remain the same.
