Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n`, `v2` is `n-1`, and `v1` retains its last value which is 3 if `r` was '<' during any iteration.**

In this final state, the loop has executed all its iterations, so `i` will be equal to `n`. The variable `v2` will hold the value of `n-1` because it is assigned the value of `i` in each iteration and `i` starts from 1 up to `n-1`. The value of `v1` will remain unchanged from its last assignment, which was 3, if `r` was '<' during any of the iterations. Otherwise, `v1` will still be 0.
