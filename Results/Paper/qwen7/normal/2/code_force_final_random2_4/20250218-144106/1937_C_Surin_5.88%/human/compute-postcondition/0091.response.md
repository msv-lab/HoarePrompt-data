Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(1, n):` will start from `i = 1` and continue until `i < n`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1. However, the problem states that `n` is an integer greater than 4, which already satisfies this condition.

3. **Adjust the state of `i`**:
   - Initially, `i` is equal to `n`. Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, we need to adjust `i` to be `1`.

4. **Ensure `n` meets the loop condition**:
   - Given that `n` is an integer greater than 4, this condition is already satisfied.

5. **Other variables**:
   - `v2`, `v1`, and `prev` are not part of the loop head, so their values do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be set to `1`.
- `n` remains as an integer greater than 4 (which is already given).

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 4**
