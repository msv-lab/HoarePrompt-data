Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `r` is an input string from the user, `g` is 0, `v1` is `n - 1`, `v2` is `n - 1`, and `prev` is 2.**

Explanation: The line `prev = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is 2) to the variable `prev`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
