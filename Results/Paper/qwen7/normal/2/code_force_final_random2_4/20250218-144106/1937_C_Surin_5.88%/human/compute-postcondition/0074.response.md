Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 4.
- `n` must be greater than 1 (though its specific value is not needed for this particular print statement).
- `v2` is 4.
- `r` is an input string from the user and its value is currently equal to '<'.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

However, there is no definition for `v1` in the initial state provided. Since `v1` is not defined, it cannot be determined what value will be printed for `v1`.

Given the information, we can only determine the values for `v2`, which is 4. Therefore, the print statement will include two instances of `v2`, which is 4.

Output: **? [v1] [v1] 4 4**
