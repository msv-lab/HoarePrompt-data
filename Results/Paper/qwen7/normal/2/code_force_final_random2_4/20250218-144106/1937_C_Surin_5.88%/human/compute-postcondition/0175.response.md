Output State: **i is n, n is the input integer, r is the input string, g is 0, v1 is n - 1, v2 is n - 1, and prev is n - 1 or any value between 1 and n-1 inclusive, depending on the user's inputs ('>') during each iteration.**

In this final state after all iterations of the loop have executed, `i` will be equal to `n`, which is the input integer provided at the start. The variable `g` remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop. `v1` and `v2` both end up being `n - 1` because they are initialized to `0` and updated to `i` in the inner loop, where `i` reaches `n - 1` before the loop exits. The variable `prev` retains its last value from the loop, which could be `n - 1` if the user always inputs '>' or any value between 1 and `n-1` inclusive based on the user's inputs during each iteration.
