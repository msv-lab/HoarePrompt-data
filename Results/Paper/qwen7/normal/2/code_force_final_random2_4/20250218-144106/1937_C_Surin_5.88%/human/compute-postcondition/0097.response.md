Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `r` is an input string, and the current value of `r` is equal to '>', `prev` is 1.**

Explanation: The code assigns the current value of `i` (which is 1) to the variable `prev`. Since `i` was initially 1, `prev` now holds the value 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
