Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range function parameters, which involve the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being set to 1 (since the range function is `range(1, n)`).

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: 
   - `i` should be set to 1 initially.
   - `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the initial states:
- `kp` is 0
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0
- `g` is 0
- `v1` is 0

We only need to adjust the states of `i` and `n` for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
