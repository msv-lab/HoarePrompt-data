Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `n` is an integer greater than 4, but its exact value is not specified.
   - `r` is an input string, but its exact value is not specified.
   - If `r` is equal to '>', then `prev` is set to 1. Otherwise, the value of `prev` is not specified.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is 2.
- `prev` is 1 if `r` is '>', otherwise it is undefined.

However, since `v1` is not defined in the initial state, we need to assume it is a variable that needs to be defined or passed to the print statement. Given the format of the print statement, it seems like `v1` might be intended to be `i`, but it is not explicitly stated. Since `i` is 2, we can reasonably assume `v1` is also 2 unless otherwise specified.

Given this reasoning, the print statement will look like this:
```python
print(f'? 2 2 2 1')
```

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 2 2 2 1**
