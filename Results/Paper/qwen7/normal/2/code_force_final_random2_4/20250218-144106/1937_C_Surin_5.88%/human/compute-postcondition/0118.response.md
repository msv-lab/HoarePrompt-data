Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `r` is an input string, and `prev` remains unchanged (still 0)**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `n`. The variable `i` was previously set to `n + 1`, so it remains unchanged. The variable `r` and `prev` are not affected by the code, so their states remain as they were initially.
