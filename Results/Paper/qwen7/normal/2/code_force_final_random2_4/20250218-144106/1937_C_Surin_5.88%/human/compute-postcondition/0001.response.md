Output State: **The function `R` is defined as a lambda function that takes input, splits it by spaces, and maps each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code defines a lambda function `R` that takes input from the user, splits the input by spaces, and maps each element to an integer. However, no variables are assigned any values yet, so the only change is the definition of the function `R`. The initial state of variables remains unchanged.
