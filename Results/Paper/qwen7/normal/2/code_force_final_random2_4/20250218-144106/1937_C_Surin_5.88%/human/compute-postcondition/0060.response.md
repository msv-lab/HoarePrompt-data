Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `r` is an input value, `prev` is 3 if `r` equals '>', otherwise `prev` remains unchanged, `kp` is 1**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The values of `i`, `r`, `prev`, and `kp` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `n` is now an integer input by the user, while the conditions and values of `r` and `prev` depend on the input value of `r`.
