Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `s` is an input string with a length greater than 1, and it contains exactly one unique character.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('No')
```

This statement will print the string `'No'` regardless of the values of `t` and `s`.

Output: **No**
