Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- If `s` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` is a string obtained by moving the first character of `s` to the end of `s`. Otherwise, `s2` remains unchanged.

The `print(s2)` statement will print the value of `s2`.

To determine `s2`, we need to consider two cases:
1. If `s` is equal to `s2`, then `s2` is modified by moving the first character of `s` to the end of `s`.
2. Otherwise, `s2` remains unchanged.

However, since the actual values of `s` and `s2` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `s2`. Therefore, the output will be the value of `s2` based on the conditions described.

Output: **s2 (where s2 is the string obtained by moving the first character of s to the end of s if s equals s2, otherwise s2 remains unchanged)**
