Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `s2` is a random permutation of the string `s`**.

Explanation: The code snippet `s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))` generates a new string `s2` which is a random permutation of the original string `s`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
