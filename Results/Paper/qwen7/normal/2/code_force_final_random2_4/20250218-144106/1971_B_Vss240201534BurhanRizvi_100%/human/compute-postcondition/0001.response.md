Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `s` is the input string received from the input mechanism.**

Explanation: The code `s = input()` reads an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and its condition \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\) is still valid. The variable `s` now holds the string input by the user.
