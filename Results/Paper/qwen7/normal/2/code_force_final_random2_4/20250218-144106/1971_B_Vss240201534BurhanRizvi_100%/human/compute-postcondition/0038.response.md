Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `s` is the input string received from the input mechanism.
- `s` is assigned the value of the input string.

The print statement is simply:

```python
print('No')
```

This statement will print the string `'No'` regardless of the values of `t` and `s`.

Output: **No**
