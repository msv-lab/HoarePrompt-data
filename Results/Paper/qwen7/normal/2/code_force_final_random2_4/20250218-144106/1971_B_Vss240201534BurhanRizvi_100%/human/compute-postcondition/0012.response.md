Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `s` is the input string received from the input mechanism; `s2` is now the string obtained by moving the first character of `s` to the end of `s`.**

Explanation: The code `s2 = s[1:] + s[0]` takes the string `s` and creates a new string `s2` by taking all characters of `s` except the first one (`s[1:]`) and appending the first character of `s` (`s[0]`) to the end. The values of `t` and the initial value of `s` remain unchanged.
