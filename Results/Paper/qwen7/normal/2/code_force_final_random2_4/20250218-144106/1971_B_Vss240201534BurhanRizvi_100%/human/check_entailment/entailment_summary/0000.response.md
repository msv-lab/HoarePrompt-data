Reasoning:

1. **Single Character String**: The program correctly identifies if the string `s` has only one character and prints 'No' for such cases.
2. **String with Identical Characters**: The program correctly identifies if the string `s` consists of identical characters and has more than one character. It then rotates the string one character to the left and prints 'Yes' followed by the modified string. This ensures that the resulting string `s2` is different from the original `s`.
3. **General Case**: For all other cases, the program generates a random permutation of the string `s` using `random.sample`. If the generated permutation `s2` is the same as the original string `s`, it tries again by rotating `s` one character to the left and then generating a random permutation. This ensures that the final `s2` is different from `s`.

Given the problem statement, the program should handle all cases correctly:
- If `s` has only one character, it correctly outputs 'No'.
- If `s` consists of identical characters and has more than one character, it correctly outputs 'Yes' followed by a rotated version of `s`.
- For all other cases, it generates a random permutation of `s` and ensures that the result is different from `s`.

Since the program logic aligns with the requirements specified in the problem statement, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
