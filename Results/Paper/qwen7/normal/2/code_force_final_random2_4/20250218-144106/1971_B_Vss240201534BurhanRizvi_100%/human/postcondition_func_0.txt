The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks the properties of the string `s`. If `s` has a single character, it prints 'No'. If `s` consists of identical characters and has more than one character, it rotates `s` one character to the left and prints 'Yes' followed by the modified string. In all other cases, it generates a random permutation of `s`, prints 'Yes', and then prints the permuted string. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.
