Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is the input string received from the input mechanism, and `s` is assigned the value of the input string. If the string `s` has a length of 1, then no change occurs. Otherwise, if `s` consists of all the same characters and has a length greater than 1, then `s2` is the string `s` rotated by one character to the left. Otherwise, `s2` remains a random permutation of the string `s`.
