Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; `s` is the input string received from the input mechanism, and `s2` is a string consisting of the same characters as `s` but in a random order.**

Explanation: The code `s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))` shuffles the characters in the string `s` to form a new string `s2`. The length and character set of `s2` remain the same as `s`, but the order of characters is randomized. The variables `t` and the condition on `s` (length not equal to 1, and the length of the set of characters in `s` is not equal to 1 or the length of `s` is not greater than 1) remain unchanged.
