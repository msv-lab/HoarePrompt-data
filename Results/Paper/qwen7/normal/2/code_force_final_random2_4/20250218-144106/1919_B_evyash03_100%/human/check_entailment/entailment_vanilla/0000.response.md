Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to minimize the penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s`. The penalty is calculated as the sum of the absolute values of the subarray sums multiplied by their lengths.
2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string (`length`) and the string itself (`expression`).
   - It then calls the function `func_1(expression, length)` to compute and print the result.
3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes the string `expression` and its length `length`.
   - It counts the number of '+' characters in the string, which corresponds to the number of 1's in the array `a`.
   - It calculates `sub` as the difference between the total length and the count of '+' characters.
   - Finally, it returns the absolute difference between `count` and `sub`.

**Issue Identification**:
- The logic in `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum penalty. Instead, it simply returns the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, which does not account for the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.

**Conclusion**:
The given program does not solve the problem correctly because it does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
