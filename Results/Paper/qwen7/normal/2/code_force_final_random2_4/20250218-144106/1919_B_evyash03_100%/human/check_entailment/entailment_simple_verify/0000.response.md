### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code to understand why the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to minimize the total penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` into subarrays. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `expression` and the string itself.
   - It then calls the function `func_1(expression, length)` to compute the penalty.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` counts the number of '+' characters in the string `expression`.
   - It then calculates `sub` as `length - count`, which represents the number of '-' characters.
   - Finally, it returns `abs(sub - count)`, which is the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters.

4. **Key Issue**:
   - The function `func_1` does not consider any optimal way to split the array `a` into subarrays to minimize the penalty. Instead, it simply computes the difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters.
   - This approach does not guarantee the minimum penalty because it does not take into account the structure of the array and how different splits might affect the penalty.

5. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the input `+-+-+-`:
     - The program would count 3 '+' and 3 '-' characters.
     - It would compute `sub = length - count = 6 - 3 = 3`.
     - It would return `abs(3 - 3) = 0`.
   - However, the optimal split would be `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])`, which results in a total penalty of 0.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The function `func_1` does not implement the optimal strategy for minimizing the penalty. It only considers the counts of '+' and '-' characters without considering the actual structure of the array and how different splits might affect the penalty.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
