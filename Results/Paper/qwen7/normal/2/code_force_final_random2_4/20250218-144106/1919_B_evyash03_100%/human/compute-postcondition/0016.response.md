Output State: **`length` is the length of the string `expression`, `count` is the total number of '+' characters in the string `expression`, `sub` is assigned the value `length - count`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the difference between the length of the string `expression` and the count of '+' characters in the string. This difference is stored in the variable `sub`. The values of `length` and `count` remain unchanged from their initial state.
