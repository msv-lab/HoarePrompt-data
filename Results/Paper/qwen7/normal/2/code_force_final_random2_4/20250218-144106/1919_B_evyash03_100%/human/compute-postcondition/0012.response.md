Output State: **`count` is either 2 or 3, `expression` is a string of length `length-3`, `char` is the third character in `expression`**.

Explanation: The value of `count` is incremented by 1. Since `count` was either 1 or 2 initially, it now becomes either 2 or 3. The values of `expression` and `char` remain unchanged.
