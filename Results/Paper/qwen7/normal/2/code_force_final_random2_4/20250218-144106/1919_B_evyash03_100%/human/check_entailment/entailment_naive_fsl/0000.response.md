Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not consider the optimal way to split the array `a` into subarrays to minimize the penalty. Instead, it simply counts the number of '+' characters and calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, which does not guarantee the minimum penalty.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
+-+-+-
```
The correct approach would be to split the array into `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])`, resulting in a total penalty of 0. However, the program would incorrectly calculate the penalty as follows:
- Count of '+' = 3
- Count of '-' = 2
- Difference = |3 - 2| = 1
- Penalty = 1 * (5 - 1) = 4

This is not the optimal solution, as the correct minimum penalty is 0. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
