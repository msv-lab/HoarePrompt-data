Output State: **`k` is 2 * `k`, `i` is len(l) - 2, `q` is len(l) - 2, `t` is len(l) - 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `b` is a list containing the sorted first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a list containing the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `n`, and `c` is sorted, `req` is `k`.**

Explanation: The line `req = k` simply assigns the value of `k` to `req`. No other variables are affected, so the values of `i`, `q`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. The value of `req` is now set to the same value as `k`.
