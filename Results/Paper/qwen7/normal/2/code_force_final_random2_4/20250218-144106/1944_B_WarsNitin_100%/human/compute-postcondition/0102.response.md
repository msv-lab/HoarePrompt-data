Output State: **i is n-1, k is -2, ans2 contains all consecutive duplicate elements from c[1] to c[n-2] twice each, and l is empty.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be `n-1` because the loop increments `i` starting from 1 up to `n-1`. The variable `k` is decremented by 2 each time the condition `c[i] == c[i - 1]` is true, and it starts at `req` (which is given to be 0 initially), so after multiple iterations where the condition is true, `k` ends up being -2. The list `ans2` will contain all consecutive duplicate elements from `c[1]` to `c[n-2]` appended twice each time they are found consecutive. Since the loop breaks when `k` becomes 0 or less, `ans2` will not contain any additional elements after that point. The list `l` is not modified within the loop and thus remains empty.
