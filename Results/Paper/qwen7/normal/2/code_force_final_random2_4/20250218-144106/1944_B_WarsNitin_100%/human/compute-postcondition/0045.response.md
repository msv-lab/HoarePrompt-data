Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given `for` loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1`. This means `i` starts at `1` and increments by `1` until it reaches `n-1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `1`
   - `n` is greater than `2`
   - `k` equals `0`

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` starts at `1` and the loop runs until `i < n`, the next value of `i` would be `2`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - The value of `k` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` needs to be set to `2`.
   - `n` remains greater than `2`.
   - `k` remains `0`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, and `k` equals 0**
