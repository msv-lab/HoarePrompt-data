Output State: **`i` is -1, `k` is -len(a) - 3, `n` is an input integer, `q` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `c` is a sublist of `a` containing the remaining elements after the first `n` elements, and `c` is sorted in ascending order, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list.**

The code initializes `ans2` as an empty list. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged.
