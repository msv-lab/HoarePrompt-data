Output State: **`k` is an integer; `ans1` now contains the element `b[i]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `ans1.append(b[i])` appends the element `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. The value of `k` remains unchanged as the condition for breaking the loop or if statement is not met (since no condition was given for `k` in the code snippet). Therefore, `k` is still an integer, and `ans1` now includes the element `b[i]` appended to its existing contents.
