Output State: **`k` is -2, `req` remains the same, `ans1` contains duplicate elements, `l` is empty, `i` is 2, `ans2` contains the element `c[3]`**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decremented by 2, changing its value from 0 to -2. The other variables (`req`, `ans1`, `l`, `i`, and `ans2`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
