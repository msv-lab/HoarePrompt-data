Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` must be at least 2, `k` is -2, and `ans2` now contains the elements `c[2]` and `c[3]`, because if `c[i] == c[i - 1]` is true, then `i` becomes 3, `k` is -2, and `ans2` contains `c[2]` and `c[3]`. Since there is no else part, these conditions hold regardless of the if condition being false.
