Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `n`, and `k`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
