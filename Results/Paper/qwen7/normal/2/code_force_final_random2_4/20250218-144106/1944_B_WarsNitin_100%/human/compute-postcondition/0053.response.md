Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `k` equals 0, and `l` contains the element `b[2]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the element `b[i]` to the list `l`. Given that `i` is 2, `l` now contains `b[2]`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. Since `k` is still 0, the condition for breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement remains the same.
