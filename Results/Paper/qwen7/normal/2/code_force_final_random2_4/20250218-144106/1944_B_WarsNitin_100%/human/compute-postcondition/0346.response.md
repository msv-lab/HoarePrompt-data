Output State: `k` is -2n, `req` remains the same, `ans1` contains duplicate elements, `l` is empty, `i` is n+1, and `ans2` contains the elements `c[3]` to `c[n+1]` each repeated twice.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. For each iteration, if `k` is non-zero, it checks if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i-1]`. If they are equal, it appends `c[i]` twice to `ans2` and decreases `k` by 2. This process continues until `k` becomes zero or the loop reaches its end. After `n-1` iterations, `k` will be `-2n` (since `k` starts as `req` and is decreased by 2 for each match found). The variable `i` will be `n` because the loop increments `i` at the start of each iteration. `ans2` will contain every element from `c[3]` to `c[n]` each repeated twice, assuming there were enough matches to fill `ans2` up to `n+1` elements.
