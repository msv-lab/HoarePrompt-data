Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `k` is -2, `ans1` is updated by appending `l[i]`, `ans2` is updated by appending `l[i]`**.

Explanation: The code snippet appends the value of `l[i]` to `ans2`. Since `i` is `n-2` and `k` remains unchanged, `ans1` is updated by appending `l[i]` as per the initial state. Therefore, `ans2` also gets the value of `l[i]` appended to it.
