Functionality: **The function processes a list of 2n integers (array a) where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, along with two integers n and k. It splits the list into two halves, sorts them, and then selects specific pairs of elements based on the value of k. Finally, it prints two lists of selected elements, ensuring that all elements in the output lists are duplicates of elements in the original list.**
