Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `-1`.
   - `k` is `-len(l) - 3`. This means `k` is the negative length of the list `l` minus 3. Since `k` is used to determine how many times the elements of `l` are appended to `ans1` and `ans2`, we need to know the length of `l`.
   - `ans1` contains all elements from `l` appended `len(l)` times.
   - `ans2` contains all elements from `l` appended `2 * len(l)` times.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(*ans1)`. The asterisk (`*`) before `ans1` unpacks the list `ans1` so that each element is printed individually.

Given the initial state, let's assume `l` has `n` elements. Therefore:
- `len(l) = n`.
- `k = -n - 3`.

Since `ans1` contains all elements from `l` appended `len(l)` times, `ans1` will have `n * n = n^2` elements.

For example, if `l` is `[1, 2, 3]`, then:
- `len(l) = 3`.
- `ans1` would contain `[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]` (3 elements repeated 3 times).

The print statement `print(*ans1)` will print each element of `ans1` on the same line separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3** (assuming `l = [1, 2, 3]` and `len(l) = 3`)

In general, the output will be the elements of `l` repeated `len(l)` times, with each element separated by a space. 

Output: **elements of l repeated len(l) times**
