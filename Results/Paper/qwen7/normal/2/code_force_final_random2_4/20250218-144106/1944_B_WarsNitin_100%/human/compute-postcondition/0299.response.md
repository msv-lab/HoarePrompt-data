Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is the same as before, `k` is either -2 or 0, and `l` is either empty or contains the element `b[3]` if `b[3] != b[2]`. If `b[i] != b[i + 1]` is true, then `l` is updated to contain the element `b[3]` if `b[3] != b[2]`. If `b[i] == b[i + 1]`, the conditions for `k` and `l` remain unchanged.
