Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is -4, `ans2` contains the elements `[c[3], c[3]]`**.

The value of `k` is decremented by 2, changing its value from either 0 or -2 to -2 or -4, respectively. Since `k` was originally either 0 or -2, after subtracting 2, `k` becomes -2 or -4. The other variables remain unchanged.
