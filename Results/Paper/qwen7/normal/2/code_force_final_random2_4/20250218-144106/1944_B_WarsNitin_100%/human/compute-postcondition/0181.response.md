Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n - 1`. This means `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches `n - 1`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `k` is 0

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `2 + 1 = 3`.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. Given that `i` is now 3, `n` must be greater than 3.

6. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be 3
   - `n` must still be greater than 3 (since the loop condition depends on `i < n`)

7. **Keep other states unchanged**: The state of `k` and the list `b` does not change based on the loop head alone.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
