Postcondition: `i` is within the range [1, n - 2], `k` equals 0, and either `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]` in which case `ans1` contains the elements `[b[i]]` and `k` is set to -2, or `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]` in which case `l` contains the element `b[i]`.
