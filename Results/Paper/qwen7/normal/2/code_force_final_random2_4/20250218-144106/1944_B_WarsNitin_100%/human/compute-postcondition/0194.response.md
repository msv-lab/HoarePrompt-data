Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `k` is `req`, `n` is an input integer, `q` is 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `c` is a sublist of `a` containing the remaining elements after the first `n` elements, and `c` is sorted in ascending order, `ans1` is a list containing all repeated elements in `b` from index `n-2` to `n-1` (if any), `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing all elements in `b` from index `n-1` to the end that do not equal their preceding element.**

Explanation: The code `k = req` simply assigns the value of `req` to `k`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `k` is now equal to `req`, while all other variables retain their original values as described in the initial state.
