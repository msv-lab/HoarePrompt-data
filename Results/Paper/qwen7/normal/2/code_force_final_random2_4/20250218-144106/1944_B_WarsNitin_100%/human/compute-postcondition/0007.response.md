Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `q` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `b` is a sublist of `a` containing the first `n` elements sorted in ascending order, `c` is a sublist of `a` containing the remaining elements after the first `n` elements, and `c` is sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code `c.sort()` sorts the list `c` in ascending order. The other variables (`t`, `q`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged. Therefore, `c` now contains the remaining elements of `a` after the first `n` elements, sorted in ascending order.
