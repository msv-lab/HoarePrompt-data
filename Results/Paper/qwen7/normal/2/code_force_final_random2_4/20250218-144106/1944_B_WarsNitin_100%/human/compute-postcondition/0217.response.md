Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is either 0 or -2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no loop or conditional block is specified in the code, we assume it breaks out of the most internal one. The values of `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 1 and `k` is either 0 or -2 also remains valid.
