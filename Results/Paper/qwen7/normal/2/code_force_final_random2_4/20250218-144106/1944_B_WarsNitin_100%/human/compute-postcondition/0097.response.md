Output State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4, `k` is -2, and `ans2` contains the element `c[4]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the element at index `i` from the list `c` to the list `ans2`. Given that `i` is 4, `ans2` will contain `c[4]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The condition `if k == 0` does not apply since `k` is -2, so no break statement is executed.
