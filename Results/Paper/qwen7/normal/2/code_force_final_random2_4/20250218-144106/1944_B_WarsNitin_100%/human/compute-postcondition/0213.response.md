Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 1; `k` is -4; `ans2` contains the value of `c[1]` appended and `c[2]` appended.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is decremented by 2, so `k` changes from either 0 or -2 to -2 - 2, which is -4. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
