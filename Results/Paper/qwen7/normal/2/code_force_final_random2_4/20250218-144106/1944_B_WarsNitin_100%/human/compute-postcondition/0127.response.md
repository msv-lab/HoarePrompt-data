Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `-1`.
   - `k` is `-len(l) - 3`.
   - `ans1` contains all elements from `l` appended `len(l)` times.
   - `ans2` contains all elements from `l` appended `2 * len(l)` times.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(*ans2)
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `ans2` contains all elements from `l` appended `2 * len(l)` times. This means if `l` has `n` elements, `ans2` will have `2 * n` repetitions of these elements.

When the `print(*ans2)` statement is executed, it will print all elements of `ans2` separated by spaces.

Therefore, the output will be all elements of `l` repeated `2 * len(l)` times, separated by spaces.

Output: **all elements of l, repeated 2 * len(l) times, separated by spaces**
