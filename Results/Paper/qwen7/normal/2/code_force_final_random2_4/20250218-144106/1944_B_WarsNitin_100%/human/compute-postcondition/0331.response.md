Output State: **`k` is -2, `req` remains the same, `ans1` contains duplicate elements, `l` is empty, `i` is 3, `ans2` contains the element `c[3]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans2.append(c[i])` appends the element `c[3]` to the list `ans2`. Given that `i` is 3, `ans2` will now contain the element `c[3]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
