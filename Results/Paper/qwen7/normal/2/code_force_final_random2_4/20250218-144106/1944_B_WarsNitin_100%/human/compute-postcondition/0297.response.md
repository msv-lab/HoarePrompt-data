Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is the same as before, `k` is either -2 or 0, and `l` is either empty or contains the element `b[3]` if `b[3] != b[2]`.**

Explanation: The code `l.append(b[i])` appends the element at index `i` of list `b` to the list `l`. Given that `i` was initially 2, after executing the code, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 3. The value of `n` remains unchanged. The value of `k` and the condition for `l` (whether it is empty or contains `b[3]` if `b[3] != b[2]`) remain the same as the precondition.
