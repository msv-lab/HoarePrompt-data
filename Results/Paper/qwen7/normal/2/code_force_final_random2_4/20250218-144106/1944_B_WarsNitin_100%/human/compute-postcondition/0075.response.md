Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, and the current value of `k` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no loop or conditional block was specified in the code, the only effect is that the execution would exit the context where the `break` statement is placed, which is implied to be the most internal loop or if statement.
