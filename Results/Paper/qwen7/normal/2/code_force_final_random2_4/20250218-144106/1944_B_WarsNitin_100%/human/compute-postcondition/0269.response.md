Output State: **`k` is `k - 2`, `i` is `len(l) - 2`, `q` is `len(l) - 2`, `t` is `len(l) - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `b` is a list containing the sorted first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a list containing the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `n`, `c` is sorted, `req` is `k`, `l` is a list with one element which is the smallest element from the first `n` elements of `a`, `ans1` now contains the second last element of `b`.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is decremented by 2, while all other variables remain unchanged. The initial values and conditions for the other variables and lists are preserved.
