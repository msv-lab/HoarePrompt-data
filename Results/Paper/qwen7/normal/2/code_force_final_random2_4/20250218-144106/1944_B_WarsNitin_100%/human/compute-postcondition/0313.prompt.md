Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `k` is an input integer, `i` is `len(l) - 2`, `q` is `len(l) - 2`, `t` is `len(l) - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `b` is a list containing the sorted first `n` elements of `a`, `c` is a list containing the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `n`, `c` is sorted, `req` is `k`. If `b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]`, `l` is a list with two elements: the smallest element from the first `n` elements of `a` and the second smallest element from the first `n` elements of `a`. Otherwise, `k` is decreased by 2, `l` is a list with one element which is the smallest element from the first `n` elements of `a`, and `ans1` now contains the second last element of `b`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
        ans1.append(b[i])
        ans1.append(b[i])
        k -= 2
    elif b[i] != b[i + 1]:
        l.append(b[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is within the range [1, n - 2]. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `k` is equal to -2, a break has occurred from the most internal loop or if statement, and `ans1` contains the elements `[b[i]]`. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `k` is equal to 0, and if `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i + 1]`, `l` contains the element `b[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is the same as before, `k` is either -2 or 0, and `l` is either empty or contains the element `b[2]` if `b[2] != b[3]`. If `b[i] == b[i - 1]` is true, then `i` is set to 3, `ans1` now contains `b[2]` and `b[3]`, and `k` is set to -2. Otherwise, `l` is updated to contain the element `b[3]` if `b[3] != b[2]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `k` is an integer, and `ans1` now contains the element `b[i]` appended to it. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `k` is decremented by 2. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, the most internal loop or if statement does not break, and `l` is a list with one additional element from `b[i]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
