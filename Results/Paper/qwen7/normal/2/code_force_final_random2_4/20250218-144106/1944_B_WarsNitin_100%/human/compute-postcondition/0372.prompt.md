Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. All other variables are not defined yet.
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    b = a[:n]
    c = a[n:]
    b.sort()
    c.sort()
    ans1 = []
    ans2 = []
    k = 2 * k
    req = k
    l = []
    if b[0] != b[1]:
        l.append(b[0])
    if b[n - 2] != b[n - 1]:
        l.append(b[n - 1])
    else:
        ans1.append(b[n - 1])
        ans1.append(b[n - 1])
        k -= 2
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        if k == 0:
            break
        if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
            ans1.append(b[i])
            ans1.append(b[i])
            k -= 2
        elif b[i] != b[i + 1]:
            l.append(b[i])
    k = req
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k == 0:
            break
        if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
            ans2.append(c[i])
            ans2.append(c[i])
            k -= 2
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if k == 0:
            break
        ans1.append(l[i])
        ans2.append(l[i])
        k -= 1
    print(*ans1)
    print(*ans2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: i is -1, k is -len(l) - 3, ans1 contains all elements from l appended len(l) times, ans2 contains all elements from l appended 2 * len(l) times.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The loop will continue to execute until `k` becomes 0. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `len(l) - 1`, `k` will be 0, `ans1` will contain all elements from `l` starting from index 1 to `len(l) - 1`, and `ans2` will also contain all elements from `l` starting from index 1 to `len(l) - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `k` is -2n, `req` remains the same, `ans1` contains duplicate elements, `l` is empty, `i` is n+1, and `ans2` contains the elements `c[3]` to `c[n+1]` each repeated twice.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
