Output State: **`a` is a reversed sorted list of integers from the input, `i` is 2, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing either `sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` if `i` is 0, or `sums = a[0] - 2 * a[x]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, or `sums = a[0]` if `i + x - 1 >= n`, and `sums` is `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sums` by adding `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Given the initial state, `i` was 1, so now `i` is 2. The value of `sums` is updated according to the new value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.
