Based on the initial state provided, we know that the loop will execute exactly `k + 1` times, and after the loop, the variable `i` will be equal to `k`. The variable `k` remains a non-negative integer, `sums` is updated based on the conditions within the loop, and `ans` contains `k + 1` elements, each representing the value of `sums` after each iteration of the loop from 0 to `k`.

The `print(max(ans))` statement will print the maximum value among the `k + 1` elements stored in the list `ans`.

Given that `ans` contains the values of `sums` after each iteration, and since `sums` is updated in each iteration, the maximum value in `ans` will be the highest value of `sums` after any of the `k + 1` iterations.

Therefore, the output will be the maximum value among the `k + 1` elements in the list `ans`.

Output: **max value in ans (where ans is a list of k + 1 elements, each representing the value of sums after each iteration from 0 to k)**
