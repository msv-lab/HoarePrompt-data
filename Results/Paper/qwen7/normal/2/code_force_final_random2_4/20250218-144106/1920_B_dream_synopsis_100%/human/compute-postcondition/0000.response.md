Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the placeholder `_`, which is used as a throwaway variable to iterate over the range returned by `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute based on the value of `int(input())`. This input will determine how many times the loop will run.

3. **Initial State**: We know from the problem statement that `t` (the number of test cases) is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

4. **Adjusting the State**: For the loop to execute, the input value must be a positive integer within the specified range. Therefore, we need to ensure that the input value matches this condition.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is the value of the input, which determines the number of iterations of the loop.

**State:**
- The input value must be a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Thus, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **input value must be a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**.
