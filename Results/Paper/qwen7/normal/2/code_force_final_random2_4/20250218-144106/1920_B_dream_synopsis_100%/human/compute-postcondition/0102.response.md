Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the sum of all elements in the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `sum1`. Since `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `sum1` will be the sum of all these integers. The values of `n`, `k`, `x`, and the list `a` remain unchanged.
