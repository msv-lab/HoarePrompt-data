Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` must be greater than or equal to 0, and the current value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`; `sums` is `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x - 1]`; `ans` now contains `[sums]`**.

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `sums` was previously defined as `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x - 1]`, the updated value of `sums` is added to `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
