Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head includes the variables `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   The loop condition is `i in range(k + 1)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `k + 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is either 0 or 1.
   - `k` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - `ans` contains specific values based on the conditions provided.

4. **Next Iteration Analysis:**
   - If `i` is currently 0, the next value of `i` will be 1.
   - If `i` is currently 1, the loop will terminate because `i` will no longer be less than `k + 1`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - If `i` is 0, it will become 1.
   - `k` remains unchanged.
   - `ans` will be adjusted based on the new value of `i`.

Given these points, let's construct the new state:

- If `i` was 0, it will now be 1.
- `k` remains the same (greater than or equal to 0).
- `ans` will be adjusted according to the new value of `i`.

Since `i` will change from 0 to 1, we need to consider the postcondition for `i` being 1:
- If `i` is 1, `ans` will contain `[sums]`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, and `ans` contains `[sums]`**.
