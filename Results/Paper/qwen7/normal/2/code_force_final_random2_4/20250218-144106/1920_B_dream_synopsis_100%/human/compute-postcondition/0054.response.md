Output State: **`a` is a reversed sorted list of integers from the input, `i` is `k + 1`, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, and `ans` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `ans`. This does not affect the values of `a`, `i`, or `sum1`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
