Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `sums` is `sums + a[1]`**.

Explanation: The code `sums = sums + a[i - 1]` increments `sums` by the value of `a[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is now 2, `a[i - 1]` refers to `a[1]`. Therefore, `sums` is updated to its previous value plus `a[1]`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged from their previous states.
