Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
   - `i` is either 0 or 1.
   - `k` is a non-negative integer.
   - `sums` is updated based on certain conditions involving `i` and `x`.
   - `ans` contains the value of the updated `sums`.

2. **Loop Head**: The loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for i in range(k + 1):
   ```

3. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `k`.

4. **Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute again if `i` is within the range specified by `range(k + 1)`. Since `i` is either 0 or 1, the loop will execute again if `k` is at least 1 (because `range(1)` includes 0, and `range(2)` includes both 0 and 1).

5. **Adjusting States**: We need to update the states of `i` and `k` such that the loop can execute again. 

   - If `i` was 0 in the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 1 in the next iteration.
   - For the loop to execute again, `k` must be at least 1.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `k`.

- `i` will be 1 in the next iteration.
- `k` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute again.

Given these adjustments, the new state is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `k` is at least 1, `sums` is updated as described, `ans` contains the value of the updated `sums`**.
