Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is at least 1, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x]`, `ans` contains the value of the updated `sums`**.

This means that the value of `sums` has been updated to its previous value plus `a[i - 1]` (which is `a[0]` since `i` is 1) minus twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]` (which is `a[x]`). The variables `i` and `k` remain unchanged, and `ans` now holds the new value of `sums`.
