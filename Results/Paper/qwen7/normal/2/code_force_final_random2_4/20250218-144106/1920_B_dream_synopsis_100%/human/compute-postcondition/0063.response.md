Output State: **`a` is a reversed sorted list of integers from the input, `i` is 1, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `sums` is `a[0] - 2 * a[x]`, and the current value of `i` plus `x` minus 1 is less than `n`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `sums` by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` (which is `a[0]` since `i` is 1) and subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]` (which is `2 * a[x]` since `i` is 1). All other variables remain unchanged.
