Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is at least 1, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[0] - 2 * a[x]`, `ans` is a list containing the value of the updated `sums`.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The values of `i`, `k`, and the expression for `sums` remain unchanged. The updated `sums` is stored in `ans` as a new element in the list.
