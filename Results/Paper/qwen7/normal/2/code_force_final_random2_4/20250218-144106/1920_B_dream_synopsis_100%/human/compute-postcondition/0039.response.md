Output State: **`i` is 2; `k` is at least 1; `sums` is `sums + a[1]`; `ans` contains the value of `sums + a[1]`**.

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `sums` is initially `sums + a[1]`, after appending, `ans` will contain the value of `sums + a[1]`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged.
