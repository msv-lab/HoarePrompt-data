Output State: **`sums` is `sums + a[0]`, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `ans` contains `[sums]`**

Explanation: The line `ans.append(sums)` appends the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `i` was initially 0, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[0]` before appending. After appending, `i` is incremented to 1 (though not shown explicitly in the code, this is implied by the context). The condition for `k` remains unchanged.
