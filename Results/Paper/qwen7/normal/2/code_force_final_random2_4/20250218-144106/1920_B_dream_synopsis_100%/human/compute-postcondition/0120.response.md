Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `ans` contains `[sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])]`, and `sums` is equal to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `sums` to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. Since the initial state of `ans` is `[sums]`, `ans` now contains the updated value of `sums`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged.
