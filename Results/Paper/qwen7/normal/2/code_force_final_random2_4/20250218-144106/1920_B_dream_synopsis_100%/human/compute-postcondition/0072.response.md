Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the constant `k + 1`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k + 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `a` is a reversed sorted list of integers from the input.
   - `i` is either 0 or 1.
   - `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`.
   - `ans` is a list containing either `sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` if `i` is 0, or `sums = a[0] - 2 * a[x]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, or `sums = a[0]` if `i + x - 1 >= n`.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 or 1, the next value of `i` would be 1 or 2 respectively.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `k + 1`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `i`.
   - If `i` was 0 before, it will become 1; if `i` was 1 before, it will become 2.
   - `k + 1` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`a` is a reversed sorted list of integers from the input, `i` is 1, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, and `ans` is a list containing either `sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` if `i` is 0, or `sums = a[0] - 2 * a[x]` if `i + x - 1 < n`, or `sums = a[0]` if `i + x - 1 >= n`**.
