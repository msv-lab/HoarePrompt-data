Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, and `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`; `sums` is `sums + a[0]`.**

Explanation: The variable `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1]` to its current value. Given that `i` was initially 0, `i - 1` becomes -1, but array indices are typically zero-based, so `a[i - 1]` refers to `a[-1]`, which is not directly accessible in Python without additional context (like using modulo or handling edge cases). However, since the problem does not specify the exact nature of `a`, we assume the operation is valid within the given constraints. After this operation, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
