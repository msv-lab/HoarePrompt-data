Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is at least 1, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `sums` to be the value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. However, the values of `sum1` and `a[:x]` are not specified in the initial state, and `x` is not defined either. Therefore, the exact numerical value of `sums` cannot be determined. The only thing we know for certain is that `i` remains 2 and `k` remains at least 1.
