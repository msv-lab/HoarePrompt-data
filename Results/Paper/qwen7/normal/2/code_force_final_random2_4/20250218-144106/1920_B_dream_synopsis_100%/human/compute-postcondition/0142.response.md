Output State: The loop will execute `k + 1` times. After all iterations, `i` will be `k`, `k` remains unchanged (as it's not modified within the loop), and `ans` will contain `k + 1` elements. Each element in `ans` represents the value of `sums` after each iteration of the loop. The value of `sums` changes based on the conditions inside the loop: it either adds `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1 < n` or just `a[i - 1]` if `i + x - 1 >= n`. Since the loop starts with `i = 0` and goes up to `k`, `ans` will contain the sequence of `sums` values calculated over these iterations.

In more detail, `ans` will contain the following sequence of values:
- Initially, `sums` is set to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.
- For each subsequent iteration, `sums` is updated according to the conditions provided in the loop body.
- The final state of `ans` will be a list containing `k + 1` elements, each representing the value of `sums` after each iteration from `i = 0` to `i = k`.
