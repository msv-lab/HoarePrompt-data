Output State: **`a` is a reversed sorted list of integers from the input, `i` is 3, `sum1` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing an additional element `sums`, `sums` is `sum1 + a[2] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The value of `sums` is calculated as `sum1 + a[2] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Since `i` is 3, `i + x - 1` would be `3 + x - 1 = 2 + x`. However, the exact value of `x` is not provided, so we keep it as `2 + x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
