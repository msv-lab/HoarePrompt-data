Output State: The loop will execute exactly `k + 1` times. After all iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `k`, `k` remains a non-negative integer, `sums` will hold the final calculated value after the last iteration of the loop, and `ans` will be a list containing `k + 1` elements. Each element in `ans` represents the value of `sums` after each iteration from `i = 0` to `i = k`. The final element in `ans` will be the maximum value among all the elements in the list, which is printed by the statement `print(max(ans))`.

In more detail, the final state will be:
- `i` will be `k`.
- `k` will remain unchanged.
- `sums` will be the value after the last iteration of the loop.
- `ans` will be a list of `k + 1` elements, where each element is the value of `sums` after each iteration from `i = 0` to `i = k`, and the last element in the list will be printed as the result.
