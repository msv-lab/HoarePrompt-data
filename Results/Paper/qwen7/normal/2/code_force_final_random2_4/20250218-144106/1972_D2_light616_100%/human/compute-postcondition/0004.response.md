Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and `t` is decreased by 1 from its previous value, and `func_1()` has been called.**

Explanation: The function `func_1()` is called, but since no specific implementation of `func_1()` is provided, we cannot determine any changes to the variables within the function. However, we know that `t` was a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and it has been decreased by 1 from its previous value. Therefore, the only change is that `t` has been decremented by 1, and the function call itself is noted.
