Output State: **`x` is 1, `y` is 4, `n` is at least 4, `m` is at least 12, and the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` remains 1**.

The value of `y` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The other variables (`x`, `n`, `m`) remain unchanged, and the condition that the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` remains 1 is still valid since the gcd of 1 and 4 is 1.
