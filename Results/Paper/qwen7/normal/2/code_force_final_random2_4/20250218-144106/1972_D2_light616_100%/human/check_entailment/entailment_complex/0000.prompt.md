Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

# Annotated Functions:
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, and the product of n and m does not exceed 2 * 10^6.
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        
        x += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `x` is greater than or equal to 5, `y` is 5, `n` is at least 10, `m` is at least 20, and `cnt` is 1.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `x` will be incremented until the condition `x * x > n` is met. Since the loop stops when `x * x` exceeds `n`, and given that `x` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, `x` will be at least 5 when the loop terminates (as it was 4 after 3 iterations and would increment to 5 on the next iteration). The value of `y` remains 5 because the inner loop does not change it. The conditions for `n` and `m` ensure they are at least 10 and 20 respectively, as these were the minimum values required even after 3 iterations. The value of `cnt` remains 1 because the inner loop only increments `cnt` once, regardless of how many times the outer loop runs.
    print(cnt)
    #This is printed: 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \) from the standard input, where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6 \) and \( n \times m \leq 2 \times 10^6 \). It then iterates over pairs of integers \( (x, y) \) starting from \( (1, 1) \) up to the point where \( x^2 > n \) and \( (x + y) \times x \leq n \) and \( (x + y) \times y \leq m \). For each valid pair \( (x, y) \) where \( \text{gcd}(x, y) = 1 \), it increments a counter \( cnt \) by the minimum of \( \frac{n}{(x + y) \times x} \) and \( \frac{m}{(x + y) \times y} \). Finally, it prints the value of \( cnt \), which is guaranteed to be 1 based on the given constraints and logic. The function does not return any value.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and t equals 1 after all iterations of the loop have been executed, and func_1() has been called t times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes up to 10,000 test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`. It then calls `func_1()` exactly `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. After processing all test cases, it does not return any value.
