Output State: **`cnt` is 1, `x` is 2, `y` is 1, `n` is at least 5, `m` is at least 20.**

Explanation: The code increments `cnt` by the minimum of two values: `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`. Given the initial values `x = 2` and `y = 1`, we can calculate `(x + y) = 3`. Therefore, the expressions become:

- `n // ((x + y) * x) = n // (3 * 2) = n // 6`
- `m // ((x + y) * y) = m // (3 * 1) = m // 3`

Since `n` is at least 5 and `m` is at least 20, the smallest possible value for `n // 6` is `5 // 6 = 0` and the smallest possible value for `m // 3` is `20 // 3 = 6`. Thus, `min(n // 6, m // 3)` will be `0` when considering the smallest possible values, but since `cnt` is incremented by this minimum value, and given the constraints, the minimum non-zero value for `min(n // 6, m // 3)` is `1` (when `n` is at least 6 and `m` is at least 3). Hence, `cnt` is incremented by `1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
