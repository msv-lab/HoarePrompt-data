To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head: `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.

Given the current state:
- `x` is 2
- `y` is 2
- `n` is at least 5
- `m` is at least 20
- `cnt` is 1

Let's evaluate the loop condition with the current values:
1. `(x + y) * x = (2 + 2) * 2 = 4 * 2 = 8`
2. `(x + y) * y = (2 + 2) * 2 = 4 * 2 = 8`

Since `n` is at least 5 and `m` is at least 20, the current values satisfy both conditions:
- `8 <= n` (since `n` is at least 5)
- `8 <= m` (since `m` is at least 20)

For the loop to continue executing, the conditions must still hold true after the next iteration. We need to consider how the values of `x` and `y` might change within the loop body, but since no specific changes are mentioned, we assume they remain as they are.

Therefore, the conditions will continue to hold true as long as:
- `(x + y) * x <= n`
- `(x + y) * y <= m`

Given that `x` and `y` are fixed at 2, the conditions will continue to hold as long as `n` remains at least 5 and `m` remains at least 20.

Thus, the only states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `m` to ensure they meet the conditions for the next iteration.

State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 2, `n` must be at least 5, `m` must be at least 20**
