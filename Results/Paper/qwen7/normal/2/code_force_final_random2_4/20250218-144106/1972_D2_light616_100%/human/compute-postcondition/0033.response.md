Output State: **`x` is 2, `y` is 3, `n` must be at least 5, `m` must be at least 20, and `cnt` is 1**.

Explanation: The value of `y` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The other variables (`x`, `n`, `m`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged according to the initial state and the given conditions.
