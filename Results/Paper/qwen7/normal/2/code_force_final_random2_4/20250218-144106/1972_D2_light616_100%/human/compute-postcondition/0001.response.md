Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the variable `t`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, we need to ensure that `t` is a positive integer.

3. **Initial State**: The initial state given is that `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, and it is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

4. **Adjusting the State**: To ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Given the constraint \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), this condition is already satisfied. However, we need to explicitly state that `t` must be a positive integer.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**.
