### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step using the given function summaries and the problem description.

#### Problem Description:
We need to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\).
2. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

#### Function Summaries:
- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function processes a single test case by iterating over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) and checking the conditions.
- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function processes up to 10,000 test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It initializes `x` to 1 and a counter `cnt` to 0.
   - It iterates over possible values of \(x\) such that \(x \cdot x \leq n\).
   - For each \(x\), it iterates over possible values of \(y\) such that \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
   - It checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\).
   - If true, it increments the count by the minimum of \(\frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x}\) and \(\frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y}\).
   - Finally, it prints the count.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - It reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - It calls `func_1` exactly \(t\) times, once for each test case.

#### Detailed Analysis:
- **Condition Check**: The condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\) is checked indirectly through the gcd calculation and the division operation.
- **Bounds**: The bounds \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\) are respected by the loops.
- **GCD Calculation**: The gcd check ensures that \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime, which simplifies the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\).

Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly counts the number of valid pairs for each test case. The function summaries also align with the expected behavior of the functions.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
