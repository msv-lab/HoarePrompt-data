Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `x * x <= n`.
2. **Current values at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is 3
   - `y` is 5
   - `n` is at least 10
   - `m` is at least 20
   - `cnt` is 1
3. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - For the loop to continue, `x * x` must be less than or equal to `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is 3, so `x * x` is 9.
   - Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `9 <= n`.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - The loop condition depends on `x` and `n`. Since `x` is fixed at 3 (and thus `x * x` is 9), the only variable that can change to allow the loop to continue is `n`.
   - `n` must be greater than 9 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` must be greater than 9.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`x` is 3, `y` is 5, `n` is at least 10, `m` is at least 20, and `cnt` is 1, but `n` must be greater than 9**
