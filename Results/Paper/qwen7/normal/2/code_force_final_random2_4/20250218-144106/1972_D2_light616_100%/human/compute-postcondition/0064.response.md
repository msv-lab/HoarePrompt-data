Output State: `x` is greater than or equal to 5, `y` is 5, `n` is at least 10, `m` is at least 20, and `cnt` is 1.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `x` will be incremented until the condition `x * x > n` is met. Since the loop stops when `x * x` exceeds `n`, and given that `x` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, `x` will be at least 5 when the loop terminates (as it was 4 after 3 iterations and would increment to 5 on the next iteration). The value of `y` remains 5 because the inner loop does not change it. The conditions for `n` and `m` ensure they are at least 10 and 20 respectively, as these were the minimum values required even after 3 iterations. The value of `cnt` remains 1 because the inner loop only increments `cnt` once, regardless of how many times the outer loop runs.
