Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Condition Check**: The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` checks if \( \gcd(x, y) \) is 1, but the problem requires checking \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) to be a multiple of \( a + b \). This condition should be checked differently.

2. **Bounds Calculation**: The bounds for `y` should be adjusted based on the condition \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) being a multiple of \( a + b \). Specifically, you need to ensure that \( y \) is chosen such that the condition holds.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
import math

def gcd_multiple_condition(a, b):
    # Calculate gcd of a and b
    gcd_ab = math.gcd(a, b)
    # Check if b * gcd(a, b) is a multiple of a + b
    return (b * gcd_ab) % (a + b) == 0

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    cnt = 0
    x = 1
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if gcd_multiple_condition(x, y):
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

func_2()
```

This corrected version ensures that the condition \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) is a multiple of \( a + b \) is properly checked, and the counts are calculated accordingly.
