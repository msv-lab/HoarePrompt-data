Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is `r[0]`.
- `m` is `r[1]`.
- `x1` is `r[2] + 1` or `r[2] + a`.
- `y1` is either `r[3] + 1` or `r[3] - 1`.
- `x2` is `r[4] - a`.
- `y2` is `r[5]`.
- `x2` is greater than `x1`.
- `(x2 - x1)` is odd.
- `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
- `t` is `abs(r[5] - r[3])`.
- The current value of `x2` is less than or equal to `x1` or `x1` is less than 1 or `x2` is greater than `n`.

The print statement is `print('draw')`.

Given this information, the print statement will output the string `'draw'`.

Output: **'draw'**
