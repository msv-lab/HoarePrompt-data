Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input for each test case using `list(map(int, input().split()))`.

2. **Initial Conditions Check**: The program checks if Bob's initial position (`x2`) is less than or equal to Alice's initial position (`x1`). If true, it immediately prints 'Draw'. This is correct according to the rules.

3. **Odd Difference Check**: If the difference between Bob's and Alice's initial row positions is odd, the program checks if the initial column positions are the same. If true, it prints 'Alice'. This is correct because Alice can always force a win by moving diagonally towards Bob's column.

4. **Even Difference Check**: If the difference is even, the program performs more detailed checks to determine the winner. These checks involve moving Alice and Bob's positions and calculating distances to determine if Alice can force a win. However, there are several issues with these checks:
   - The logic for updating positions and checking distances is complex and not fully aligned with the game rules.
   - The conditions for determining a win or draw are not clearly defined and may lead to incorrect outcomes.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle all edge cases properly, such as when Alice or Bob reaches the boundary of the board without capturing the opponent's chip.

Given the complexity and the potential for errors in the detailed checks, let's evaluate the correctness of the program:

- The initial checks and basic logic seem correct.
- The detailed checks for even differences are overly complicated and may not accurately reflect the game's rules.

Correctness: **False**

The program needs to be revised to ensure it correctly implements the game rules and handles all edge cases appropriately.
