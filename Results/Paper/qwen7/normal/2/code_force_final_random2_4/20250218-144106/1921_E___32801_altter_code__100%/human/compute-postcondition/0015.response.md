Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is r[0], m is r[1], x1 is r[2], y1 is r1 - 1, x2 is r[4], y2 is r[5], x2 is greater than x1, and (x2 - x1) is odd, and y2 is less than or equal to y1**.

Explanation: The value of `y1` is decremented by 1. Since `y1` was initially `r[3]`, after the operation, `y1` becomes `r[3] - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions specified in the initial state that are still valid are included in the output state.
