Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is `r[0]`.
- `m` is `r[1]`.
- `x1` is `r[2]`.
- `y1` is `r[3]`.
- `x2` is `r[4]`.
- `y2` is `r[5]`.
- `x2` is greater than `x1`.
- `(x2 - x1)` is odd.
- The current value of `y1` is equal to `y2`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('Alice')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'Alice'`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`) are not relevant to the output of this specific print statement.

Output: **Alice**
