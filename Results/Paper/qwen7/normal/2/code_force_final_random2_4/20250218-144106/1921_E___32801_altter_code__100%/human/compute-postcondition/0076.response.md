Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + a`, `y1` is 1, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y2` is `r[5] - (m - y1)`, `a` is `m - y1`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `t` is `abs(r[5] - 1)`**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `y2` is set to `r[5]`.
- The code `y2 -= a` subtracts the value of `a` from `y2`. Since `a` is defined as `m - y1` and `y1` is 1, `a` is `m - 1`.
- Therefore, `y2` becomes `r[5] - (m - 1)`, which simplifies to `r[5] - m + 1`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
