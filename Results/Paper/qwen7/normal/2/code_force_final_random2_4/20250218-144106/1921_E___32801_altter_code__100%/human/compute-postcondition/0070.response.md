Let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Variables and their values:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is `r[0]`.
   - `m` is `r[1]`.
   - `x1` is `r[2] + a`.
   - `y1` is `r[3]`.
   - `x2` is `r[4] - a`.
   - `y2` is `r[5]`.
   - `a` is determined by the condition:
     - If `y2 >= y1`, then `a = y1 - 1`.
     - Otherwise, `a = m - y1`.
   - `b` is `x2 - x1`.
   - `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`.
   - The current value of `x2` is less than or equal to `x1` or `x1` is less than 1 or `x2` is greater than `n`.

2. **Determine the value of `a`:**
   - Since `x2` is less than or equal to `x1` or `x1` is less than 1 or `x2` is greater than `n`, it implies that the coordinates do not form a valid rectangle or line segment. Therefore, the value of `a` does not affect the final result because the condition ensures that the drawing operation (`draw`) will still be executed.

3. **Determine the value of `t`:**
   - Given that `t` is set to `abs(y2 - y1)`, and considering the conditions provided, the value of `t` will be a non-negative integer representing the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print('draw')` statement will execute and print the string `'draw'`.

Output: **draw**
