Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + a`, `y1` is adjusted based on the condition (`y1` becomes 1 if `y1 <= y2` and `m` otherwise), `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y2` is adjusted based on the condition (`y2` becomes `m - (y1 - 1)` if `y1 <= y2` and `m + (y1 - 1)` otherwise), `a` is adjusted based on the condition (`a` becomes `m - y1` if `y1 <= y2` and `y1 - 1` otherwise), `b` is `x2 - x1`, and `c` is either `r[5] - m` or `m - y2` depending on the condition.
