Output State: **`t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`, `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `m`, `x1` is `r[2] + a`, `y1` is `m`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y2` is `m + (m - y1)` if `y2` is less than `y1`, otherwise `m + (y1 - 1)`, `a` is `m - y1` if `y2` is less than `y1`, otherwise `a` is `y1 - 1`, `b` is `x2 - x1`, `c` is `m - y2`.**

Explanation:
- The code `c = m - y2` assigns the value of `m - y2` to the variable `c`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged from their previous values.
- The condition `(x2 > x1 and x1 >= 1 and x2 <= n)` is still true, as no changes were made to `x1` or `x2` that would affect this condition.
- The value of `t` remains `abs(y2 - y1)` as no changes were made to `y2` or `y1` that would alter this value.
