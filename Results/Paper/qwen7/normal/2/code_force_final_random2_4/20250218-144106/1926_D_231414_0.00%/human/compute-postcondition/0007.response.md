Output State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `check` is 2147483647, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `dic` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is equal to `n`, `check` is 2147483647.**

Explanation: The code simply reassigns the value of `check` to `2 ** 31 - 1`, which is 2147483647. This does not affect any other variables, so their previous states remain unchanged.
