Output State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `check` is 2147483647, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value entered by the user (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The initial conditions for `times` and `check` remain unchanged. Therefore, `times` must still be greater than 0, and `check` remains 2147483647.
