Output State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `check` is 2147483647, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `data = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `data`. The initial conditions for `times`, `check`, and `n` remain unchanged.
