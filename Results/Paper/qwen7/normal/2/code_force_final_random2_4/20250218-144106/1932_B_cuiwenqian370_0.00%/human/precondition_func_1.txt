t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of signs, and path is a space-separated string containing n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, representing the periodicities of the signs.
