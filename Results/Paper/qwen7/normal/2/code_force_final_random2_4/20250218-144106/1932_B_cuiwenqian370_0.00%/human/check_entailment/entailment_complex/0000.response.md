Reasoning:
1. **Function 1 Analysis**: The function `func_1` is designed to find the longest valid sequence of signs ('@') in a string `path` that consists of '@' (valid signs) and '*' (invalid signs or gaps). However, the problem statement describes a different scenario where we need to calculate the year when the nth sign of the apocalypse will occur based on their periodicities. The function `func_1` does not seem to address the actual problem requirements.

2. **Function 2 Analysis**: The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes each test case by calling `func_1` on the `path` string, and then prints the results. Since `func_1` does not correctly solve the problem, `func_2` also cannot produce the correct results.

Given that both functions do not align with the problem's requirements, the overall program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
