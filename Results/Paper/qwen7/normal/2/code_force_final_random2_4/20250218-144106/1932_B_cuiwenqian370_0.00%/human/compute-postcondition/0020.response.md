Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `index` is increased by 33, `path` is now `data[index]`, `results` list has a new element which is the return value of `func_1(data[index])`, `n` is the value of `data[index]`, `n` is an integer**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `path` was `data[index-1]`.
- After executing `path = data[index]`, the value of `path` is updated to `data[index]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `index`, `results`, `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
