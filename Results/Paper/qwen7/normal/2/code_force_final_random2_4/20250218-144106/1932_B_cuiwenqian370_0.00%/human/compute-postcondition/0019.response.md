Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `index` is increased by 33, `path` is the value of `data[index-1]`, `results` list has a new element which is the return value of `func_1(path)`, `n` is the value of `data[index-1]`, `n` is an integer**

Explanation: The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. Initially, `index` was increased by 32, so now it is increased by 33. The values of `path`, `results`, and `n` remain unchanged as they are dependent on the current value of `index`, which is now `index-1`.
