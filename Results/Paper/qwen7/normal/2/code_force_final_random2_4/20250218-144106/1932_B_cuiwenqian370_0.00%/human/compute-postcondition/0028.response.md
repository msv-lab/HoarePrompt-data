Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for result in results:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `result` and `results`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in the `results` list.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `results` must have at least one element.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must still have at least one element. However, since we are moving to the next iteration, one element from `results` has already been processed by the loop body. Therefore, `results` must now have at least two elements (one less than before).

5. **Update the state**:
   - `results` must have at least two elements.

So, the updated state for the next iteration is:

**State: **`results` must have at least two elements**
