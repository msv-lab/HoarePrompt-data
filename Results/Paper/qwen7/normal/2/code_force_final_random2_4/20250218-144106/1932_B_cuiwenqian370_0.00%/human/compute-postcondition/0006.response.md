Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer from `data[index]`**.

The code assigns the value of `data[index]` (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. The value of `index` and the contents of `data` are not specified, so they remain as part of the initial state.
