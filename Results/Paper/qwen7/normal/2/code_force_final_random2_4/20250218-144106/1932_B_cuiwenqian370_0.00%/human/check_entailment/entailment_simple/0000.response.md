### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the year when all \( n \) signs of the apocalypse will occur sequentially. Each sign occurs periodically, and the next sign can only occur strictly after the previous one.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - This function seems to be incorrectly named and unrelated to the problem's requirements. It appears to be designed to process a string of `@` and `*` characters, which does not align with the problem statement about periodic occurrences of signs.
     - The logic in this function does not relate to finding the year when the signs will occur sequentially based on their periodicity.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
     - However, since `func_1` is not correctly solving the problem, the overall function `func_2` will also not solve the problem correctly.

3. **Expected Solution**:
   - The correct approach would involve calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities of the signs to find the earliest year when all signs will occur simultaneously.
   - Given the periodicities \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \), the LCM of these numbers would give the year when all signs will occur together.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the provided code does not implement the correct logic to solve the problem, both functions are incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Function `func_1` is unrelated to the problem, and Function `func_2` relies on `func_1`, making the entire solution incorrect.
