The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (number of signs), and a string `path` containing space-separated integers representing the periodicities of the signs. For each test case, it calls `func_1(path)` to process the `path` string and stores the result. After processing all test cases, it prints the results of `func_1` for each test case.
