Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `result` which is being iterated over from the list `results`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `result`**: Since the loop is iterating over `results`, the initial state of `result` should be one of the elements in the list `results`.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - The variable `result` is the object being iterated over, so its initial state must be one of the elements in `results`.
   - The list `results` itself must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state information:
- `t` must be 0 or less.
- `index` is increased by 51.
- `path` is the value of `data[index]`.
- `results` is a list with three additional elements which are the return values of `func_1(data[index])` for each iteration.
- `n` is the value of `data[index]`, and `n` is an integer.

Since the loop is iterating over `results`, the key adjustment needed is ensuring that `results` has at least one element.

**Final State Adjustment**:
- `results` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the final state is:
State: **`results` must have at least one element**
