Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not match the problem description at all. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` seem to be designed for a completely different problem, involving paths with special characters ('@' and '*'), rather than calculating the year when all signs of the apocalypse will occur based on their periodicities.

To solve the given problem correctly, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of all periodicities. Here's how you can do it:

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[1])
        periodicities = list(map(int, data[2:n+2]))
        result = reduce(lcm, periodicities)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage:
# You would call func_2() to run the function with input from stdin.
```

This code defines a helper function `lcm` to calculate the least common multiple of two numbers using the greatest common divisor (gcd). It then uses `reduce` to apply this function across all periodicities, effectively finding the LCM of all the periodicities, which is the year when all signs will occur sequentially.
