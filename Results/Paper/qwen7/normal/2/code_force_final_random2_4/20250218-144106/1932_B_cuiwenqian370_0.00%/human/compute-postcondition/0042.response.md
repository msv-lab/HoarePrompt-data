Postcondition: `dp[i]` is updated based on the value of `path[i]`. If `path[i]` is '*', `dp[i]` is set to -infinity. Otherwise, `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]` plus 1 if `path[i]` is '@', or simply the maximum of `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]` if `path[i]` is not '@'.
