Output State: **`t` must be 0 or less; `index` is increased by 51 (since 3 times 17 equals 51); `path` is the value of `data[index]`; `results` is a list with three additional elements which are the return values of `func_1(data[index])` for each iteration; `n` is the value of `data[index]`, `n` is an integer.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` should be 0 or less because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The `index` will have been incremented by 51 (17 increments per iteration times 3 iterations). The `path` will be the value of `data[index]` after the last iteration. The `results` list will contain the return values of `func_1(path)` for each of the three iterations.
