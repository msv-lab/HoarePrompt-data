Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string by spaces.**

Explanation: The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was initially defined. The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input from the standard input (using `sys.stdin.read`), splits it into a list of strings based on spaces, and assigns this list to the variable `data`. Therefore, `t` retains its initial value, and `data` now holds the split input as a list of strings.
