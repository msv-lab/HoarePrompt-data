Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases, and the input reading process starts using `sys.stdin.read`.**

Explanation: The line `input = sys.stdin.read` replaces the standard `input()` function with `sys.stdin.read()`. This means that instead of reading input from the user through the console, the program will read the entire input from the standard input stream (stdin) at once. The values of `t`, `n`, and `path` will be read as a single string, and the subsequent processing will depend on how the rest of the code handles this input. However, the initial state of `t` remains unchanged, and the method of input reading is updated.
