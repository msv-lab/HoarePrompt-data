Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(t):`. This means the loop variable is `_` (a placeholder) and the condition for the loop to continue is based on the value of `t`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `index` is increased by 2.
   - `path` is the value of `data[index]`.
   - `results` list has a new element which is the return value of `func_1(path)`.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `t` is greater than 0, `t` must be decremented by 1 for the next iteration.
   - `index` is increased by 2 from the previous state.
   - `path` is updated to the value of `data[index]` for the new `index`.
   - `results` list gets a new element which is the return value of `func_1(path)` for the new `path`.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `t` must be greater than 0 and decreased by 1.
- `index` is increased by 2.
- `path` is updated to `data[index]`.
- `results` list gets a new element which is the return value of `func_1(path)`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `index` is increased by 2, `path` is the value of `data[index]`, `results` list has a new element which is the return value of `func_1(path)`**.
