Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not follow the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to determine the year in which all \( n \) signs of the apocalypse will occur sequentially. However, the given code includes two functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) that do not relate to the problem at all. Instead, `func_1` seems to be solving a different problem related to paths containing '@' and '*' characters, and `func_2` reads input and calls `func_1` multiple times. Neither function addresses the logic required to calculate the year when all signs will occur sequentially based on their periodicities. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
