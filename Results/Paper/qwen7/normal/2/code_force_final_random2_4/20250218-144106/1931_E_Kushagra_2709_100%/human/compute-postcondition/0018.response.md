Output State: `num` is a string representation of an integer with a length of at least 1, `i` is 0, `tot` is equal to the number of trailing zeros in the string `num`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be set to 0 because the loop decrements `i` from `len(num) - 1` until it finds a non-zero digit or reaches the start of the string. The variable `tot` will count how many times the condition `if num[i] != '0': break` was false, which corresponds to the number of trailing zeros in the string `num`. If there are no trailing zeros, `tot` will be equal to the length of `num`.
