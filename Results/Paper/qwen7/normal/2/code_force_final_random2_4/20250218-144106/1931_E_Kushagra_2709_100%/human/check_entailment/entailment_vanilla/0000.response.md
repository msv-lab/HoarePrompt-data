Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Players take turns, starting with Anna.
   - Anna reverses the digits of one number.
   - Sasha concatenates two numbers.
   - The game ends when only one number remains and Sasha wins if this number is at least \(10^m\).
   - Both players play optimally.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The solution seems to focus on counting the number of trailing zeros in the numbers, which is a crucial factor in determining the length of the resulting number after concatenation.
   - The function `func_1` calculates a value `tot` which is used to determine the winner.

3. **Function `zerocnts`:**
   - This function counts the number of trailing zeros in a number.
   - It converts the number to a string, iterates from the end to the beginning, and counts the zeros until a non-zero digit is encountered.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `tot` is calculated as the sum of the lengths of the numbers in the list.
   - `cntvals` is a list of the number of trailing zeros in each number, sorted in descending order.
   - The loop iterates over `cntvals` in steps of 2, subtracting the values from `tot`.
   - The final decision is made based on whether `tot` is greater than or equal to \(m + 1\).

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Counting Trailing Zeros:**
   - The `zerocnts` function correctly counts the trailing zeros in a number.

2. **Summing Lengths and Subtracting Trailing Zeros:**
   - The `tot` variable sums the lengths of the numbers.
   - The loop subtracts the number of trailing zeros in pairs of numbers, which seems to be an attempt to simulate the effect of concatenations on the total length.

3. **Decision Logic:**
   - The decision logic in `func_1` checks if `tot` (adjusted by subtracting the trailing zeros) is greater than or equal to \(m + 1\).
   - If true, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

### Verification:

- The logic in `func_1` appears to be attempting to simulate the game's outcome by considering the effective length of the numbers after optimal play.
- However, the exact mechanism of how trailing zeros affect the game's outcome is not clearly explained in the problem statement.
- The subtraction of trailing zeros in pairs might not fully capture the complexity of the game, especially since the game involves more strategic decisions beyond just trailing zeros.

### Conclusion:

Given the complexity of the game and the lack of clear explanation for why the trailing zeros are being subtracted in pairs, the provided solution might not fully capture the optimal strategy required to determine the winner.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
