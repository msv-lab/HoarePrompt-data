Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `num` is a string representation of an integer with a length of at least 1.
   - `i` is `len(num) - 1`.
   - `tot` is 1.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from `len(num) - 1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches `-1`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was decremented by 1 from its initial value (`len(num) - 1`). Therefore, `i` is now `len(num) - 2`.
   - The loop will continue if `i` is greater than or equal to `-1`. Since `i` is now `len(num) - 2`, which is still greater than `-1`, the loop can execute one more time.
   - The state of `num` and `tot` remains unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

5. **Updated State:**
   - `i` is now `len(num) - 2`.
   - `tot` remains `1`.
   - `num` remains the same string representation of an integer.

Therefore, the updated state for the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer with a length of at least 1, `i` is `len(num) - 2`, `tot` is 1**.
