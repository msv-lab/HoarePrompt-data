Output State: `num` is a string representation of an integer with a length of at least 1, `i` is 0, `tot` is equal to the number of trailing zeros in `num`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be set to 0 because the loop decrements `i` from `len(num) - 1` until it finds a non-zero digit or reaches the beginning of the string. The variable `tot` will count the number of trailing zeros in the string `num`. This is because each time the loop encounters a '0', it increments `tot` by 1. Once a non-zero digit is encountered, the loop breaks, and `i` remains as the index of that non-zero digit.
