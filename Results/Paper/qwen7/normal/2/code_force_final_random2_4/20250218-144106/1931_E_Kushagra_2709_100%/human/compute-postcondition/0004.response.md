Output State: **`num` is a string representation of an integer with a length of at least 1, `i` is `len(num) - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it was inside. Since no such block is specified in the given code, the only effect is the indication of breaking out of an implied loop or conditional.
