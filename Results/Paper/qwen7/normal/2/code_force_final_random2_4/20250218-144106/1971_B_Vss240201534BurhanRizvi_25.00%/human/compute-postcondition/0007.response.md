Output: **No**

Explanation:
- The initial state tells us that `s2` is a random permutation of the string `s`, and `s` is equal to `s2`. This means that `s` and `s2` are the same string.
- The print statement simply outputs the string `'No'`.

Since the print statement does not depend on any variables or their values but instead directly outputs a fixed string, the output is simply `'No'`.
