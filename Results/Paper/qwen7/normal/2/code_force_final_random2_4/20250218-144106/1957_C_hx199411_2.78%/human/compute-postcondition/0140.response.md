Output State: **`dp[4]` is `(dp[3] + 3 * dp[2] * 2) % 1000000007`, `i` is 4**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp[i]` where `i` is now 4. The formula used is `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. Given that `i` is now 4, the formula becomes `dp[4] = (dp[3] + 3 * dp[2] * 2) % 1000000007`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `c`, `r`, `m`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
