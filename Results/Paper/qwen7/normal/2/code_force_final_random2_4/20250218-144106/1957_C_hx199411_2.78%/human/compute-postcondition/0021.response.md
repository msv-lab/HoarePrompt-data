Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `i` is 3, `k` is a positive integer greater than 2, `num` is `i` + 1, `c` is an input integer from the split, `r` is an input integer from the split.**

Explanation: The variable `num` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was initially 3, `num` is now `i + 1`, which is 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
