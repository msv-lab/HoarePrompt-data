Output State: **`t` is False, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 1, `c` is an input integer from the split input, `r` is an input integer from the split input**.

The code `c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes two integers as input separated by a space and assigns them to `c` and `r`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, and `i` remain unchanged.
