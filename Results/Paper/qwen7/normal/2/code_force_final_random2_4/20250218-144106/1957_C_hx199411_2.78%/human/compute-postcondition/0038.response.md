Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `i` is equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `c` is an input integer from the split, `r` is an input integer from the split, `num` is the sum of 1 or 2 for each iteration based on whether `c` equals `r` or not, `m` is a non-zero integer calculated as `n - num`, `m` is not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is initialized to 0.**

The code initializes a list `dp` with `m + 1` elements, all set to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `i`, `k`, `c`, `r`, `num`, or `m`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
