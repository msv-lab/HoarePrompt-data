Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `i` is 2, `k` must be a positive integer, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, and `c` is not equal to `r`**.

The value of `num` was incremented by 2, changing its initial value (which was 0) to 2. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
