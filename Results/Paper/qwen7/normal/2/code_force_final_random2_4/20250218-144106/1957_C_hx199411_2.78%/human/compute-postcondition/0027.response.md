Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `i` is equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `c` is an input integer from the split, `r` is an input integer from the split, `num` is the sum of 1 or 2 for each iteration based on whether `c` equals `r` or not, `m` is calculated as `n - num`.**

Explanation: The code `m = n - num` assigns the value of `n - num` to the variable `m`. The values of `t`, `i`, `k`, `c`, `r`, and `num` remain unchanged from their previous states.
