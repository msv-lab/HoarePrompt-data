Output State: **`i` is equal to `k + 2`, `k` is a positive integer, `c` and `r` are input integers, `num` is the total number of inputs processed, `m` is greater than 0, and `m` is not equal to 1; `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `dp` with `m + 1` elements, all set to 0. This does not affect the values of `i`, `k`, `c`, `r`, `num`, or `m`. Therefore, those variables retain their initial states.
