Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for i in range(3, m + 1):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the Current Values:**
   - `i` is equal to `k` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `m` is a non-zero integer calculated as `n - num` and must be at least 2.
   - `m` is not equal to 1.

3. **Update the Values for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` starts from `k` and the loop iterates over `range(3, m + 1)`, `i` will increment by 1 for each iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.
   - `m` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop body.

4. **State Adjustment:**
   - `t` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\) and does not change within the loop.
   - `c` and `r` remain unchanged as they are inputs from the split and not modified within the loop.
   - `num` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `m` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `dp` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

Given these points, the only variables that need adjustment are `i` and `m`.

**Final State:**
- `t` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\).
- `i` is `k + 1`.
- `k` must be at least 3.
- `c` is an input integer from the split.
- `r` is an input integer from the split.
- `num` is the sum of 1 or 2 for each iteration based on whether `c` equals `r` or not.
- `m` is a non-zero integer calculated as `n - num` and must be at least 2, `m` is not equal to 1.
- `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is initialized to 0, `dp[1]` is set to 1, `dp[2]` is set to 3, `dp[i]` is updated to \((dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7)\).

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `i` is `k + 1`, `k` must be at least 3, `c` is an input integer from the split, `r` is an input integer from the split, `num` is the sum of 1 or 2 for each iteration based on whether `c` equals `r` or not, `m` is a non-zero integer calculated as `n - num` and must be at least 2, `m` is not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where each element is initialized to 0, `dp[1]` is set to 1, `dp[2]` is set to 3, `dp[i]` is updated to \((dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7)\)**
