Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is a positive integer, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `num` is 4.**

Explanation: Initially, `num` is 1 if `c` equals `r`, or 2 if `c` does not equal `r`. After executing `num += 2`, `num` is incremented by 2. Therefore, `num` becomes 3 if initially it was 1, or 4 if initially it was 2. Since the condition for `num` being 1 or 2 depends on the values of `c` and `r`, and those values remain unchanged, `num` is now 4 regardless of the initial condition. All other variables (`i`, `k`, `c`, and `r`) remain in their initial states.
