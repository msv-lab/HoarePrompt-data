Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` must be a positive integer, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, and `c` is not equal to `r`; `num` is 2.**

Explanation: The initial value of `num` is not specified, but the code `num += 2` increments `num` by 2. Since `i` is 0, `k` is a positive integer, `c` is an input integer, and `r` is an input integer with the condition that `c` is not equal to `r`, these values remain unchanged. After executing the code, `num` becomes 2.
