Output State: **`t` is False, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is an integer between `k` and `2*k`, `i` is `k-1`, `c` is an input integer from the split input, `r` is an input integer from the split input, `m` is `n - num`, `m` is not equal to 0, `m` is not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3.**

Explanation: The code `dp[2] = 3` updates the value of `dp[2]` to 3. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
