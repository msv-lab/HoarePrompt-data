Output State: **`t` is False, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `num` is an integer between `k` and `2*k`, `i` is `k-1`, `c` is an input integer from the split input, `r` is an input integer from the split input, `m` is `n - num`, `m` is not equal to 0, `m` is not equal to 1, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `dp` with `m + 1` elements, all set to 0. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `num`, `i`, `c`, `r`, `m`, and the condition that `m` is not equal to 0 and not equal to 1 are preserved.
