Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `i` is 3, `k` is a positive integer greater than 2, `c` is an input integer from the split, `r` is an input integer from the split, `num` is `i` + 2**.

This means that the value of `num` has been updated to be the original value of `i` (which is 3) plus 2, resulting in `num` being 5. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
