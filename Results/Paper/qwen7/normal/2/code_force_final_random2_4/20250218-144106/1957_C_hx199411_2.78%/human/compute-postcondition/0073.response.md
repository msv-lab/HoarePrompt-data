Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is a positive integer, `c` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `num` is increased by 1.**

The code `num += 1` increments the value of `num` by 1. Since `num` was previously an unspecified variable, after executing this line, `num` is increased by 1. All other variables (`i`, `k`, `c`, `r`) remain unchanged.
