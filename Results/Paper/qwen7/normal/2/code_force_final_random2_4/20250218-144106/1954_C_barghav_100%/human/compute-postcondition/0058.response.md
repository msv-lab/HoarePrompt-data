Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Initial State: 
   - `a` and `b` are strings.
   - `i` is 4.
   - `b` must have a length of 3.

2. Analysis:
   - Since `b` must have a length of 3, it can only contain up to 3 characters.
   - The index `i` is 4, which is out of bounds for a string of length 3 because string indices are zero-based (0, 1, 2).

3. What will be printed:
   - When trying to access `b[i]` where `i` is 4, Python will raise an `IndexError` because the index is out of the valid range for the string `b`.

Given this reasoning, the output will be an error message indicating an index out of range.

Output: **IndexError: string index out of range**
