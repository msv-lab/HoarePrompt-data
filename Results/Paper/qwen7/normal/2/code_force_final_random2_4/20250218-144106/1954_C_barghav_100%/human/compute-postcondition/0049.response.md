Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state defines that `a` and `b` are strings.
2. `i` is explicitly set to 0.
3. `f` is explicitly set to 0, but it is not used in the print statement.

The print statement `print(a[i], end='')` will access the character at index `i` of the string `a`.

Given that `i` is 0, it means we are accessing the first character of the string `a`.

Therefore, the output will be the first character of the string `a`.

Output: **the first character of string a**
