Given the initial state:
- `a` and `b` are strings.
- `i` is 2.
- `f` is 0.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(a[i], end='')`.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The variable `i` is explicitly given as 2.
2. Since `a` is a string, `a[i]` refers to the character at index 2 of the string `a`.
3. The `end=''` parameter in the `print` function does not affect what is printed; it only affects how the output is terminated (in this case, it doesn't add any characters after the printed content).

Therefore, the code will print the character at index 2 of the string `a`.

Output: **the character at index 2 of string a**
