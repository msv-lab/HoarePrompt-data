Postcondition: `a[i]` and `b[i]` are elements from arrays `a` and `b` respectively. If `f == 0` and `a[i]` is less than `b[i]`, then `f` is set to 1, and `a[i]` and `b[i]` swap their values. If `f == 0` and `a[i]` is not less than `b[i]`, `f` retains its original value and `a[i]` and `b[i]` keep their original values. If `f != 0`, `a[i]` and `b[i]` are swapped such that if `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, `a[i]` is now equal to the original value of `b[i]` and `b[i]` is now equal to the original value of `a[i]`. If `a[i]` is not greater than `b[i]`, no change occurs.
