#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are strings representing integers of the same length, consisting of digits from 1 to 9.
def func_1():
    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())
    f = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if f == 0:
            if a[i] < b[i]:
                a[i], b[i] = b[i], a[i]
                f = 1
            elif a[i] > b[i]:
                f = 1

    #State: After all iterations, `a` and `b` will contain the characters from the respective strings such that each character in `a` is either equal to or greater than the corresponding character in `b`, and `f` will be 1 if any swap occurred during the loop execution; otherwise, it will remain 0.
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
        
    #State: Output State: `a` and `b` are strings, `i` is 4, `f` is 0.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs for each index in the range defined by `len(a)`. Since the output state after 3 iterations shows that `i` is 2, it means the loop has completed 3 iterations so far. Therefore, the total number of characters in string `a` is 4 (since `i` starts from 0). The loop continues until `i` reaches the length of `a`, which is 4. Given that no swaps (`f`) have occurred throughout the iterations (as `f` remains 0), the final value of `i` will be 4 after all iterations are complete.
    print()
    #This is printed: Output:
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
        
    #State: Output State: `a` and `b` are strings, `i` is 4, `b` must have a length of 4.
    #
    #Explanation: Given that the loop runs as long as `i` is less than the length of `b`, and since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration, the loop will run until `i` equals the length of `b`. From the initial state, we know `i` is 4, and after 3 iterations, `b` still has a length of 3. This means the loop has just completed its 3rd iteration, and `i` is now 3. Therefore, in the next iteration, `i` will reach 4, which is equal to the length of `b`, and the loop will terminate. Thus, the final length of `b` will be 4, and `i` will be 4 after all iterations are complete.
    print()
    #This is printed: Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes two strings `x` and `y` as input, where both strings represent integers of the same length consisting of digits from 1 to 9. It ensures that each character in string `a` (initially set to `x`) is either equal to or greater than the corresponding character in string `b` (initially set to `y`). If any swap occurs during the process, a flag `f` is set to 1. After processing, the function prints both strings `a` and `b`. The final state of the program is that both strings `a` and `b` are printed, and the variable `i` is set to the length of the strings.
