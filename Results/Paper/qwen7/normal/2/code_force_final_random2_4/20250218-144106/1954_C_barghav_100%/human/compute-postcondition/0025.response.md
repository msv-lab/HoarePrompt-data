Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is a list of characters with at least one character.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `f` is 1 if `a[i]` is less than `b[i]`, otherwise `f` is 0.
   - If `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]`, then `a[i]` is set to the previous value of `b[i]` and `b[i]` is set to the previous value of `a[i]`.
   - If `a[i]` is not greater than `b[i]`, the values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` remain unchanged.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(len(a)):
   ```

3. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

4. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < len(a)`.

5. **Current Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.

6. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented from 0 to 1.
   - Therefore, `i` should be 1 at the start of the next iteration.

7. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `i` is the only variable in the loop head, we only need to adjust `i`.
   - The other variables (`a`, `b`, and `f`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

**Final State:**
- `i` is 1.
- `a` remains a list of characters with at least one character.
- `b` remains a list of characters (with the same length as `a`).
- `f` remains 1 if `a[0]` was less than `b[0]` in the previous iteration, otherwise `f` remains 0.

**State:**
**`i` is 1, `a` is a list of characters with at least one character, `b` is a list of characters, `f` is 1 if `a[0]` was less than `b[0]` in the previous iteration, otherwise `f` is 0.**
