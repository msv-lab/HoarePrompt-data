Postcondition: `i` is 3, `n` is an input integer greater than 3, `a` is a list, and after executing the if-else block, if `a[2] > a[3]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `check_all_new` and `new_all` are boolean values indicating whether all elements in the slice `new` (from index 3 to the end of `a`) satisfy certain conditions. If there is no else part, the same conditions apply if the if condition is not met.
