Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `a[0]` is greater than the current value of `a[1]`.
   - `new` is a list starting from `a[2]` to the end of the list `a`.
   - `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are less than or equal to `a[0]`.
   - `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order.
   - In either case, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1 (i.e., `i` becomes 3).
   - The condition `i < n` must still hold true, meaning `n` must remain greater than 3 (since `i` is now 3).

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` is incremented to 3.
   - `n` must still be greater than 3.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
