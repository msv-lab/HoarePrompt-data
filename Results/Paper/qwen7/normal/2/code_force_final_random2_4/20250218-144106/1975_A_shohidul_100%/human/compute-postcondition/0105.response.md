Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `new` is a list starting from `a[i]` which is `a[1]` and onwards.**

Explanation: The code `new = a[i:]` creates a new list `new` that starts from the element at index `i` of the list `a`. Given that `i` is 1, `new` will start from `a[1]` and include all subsequent elements of the list `a`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
