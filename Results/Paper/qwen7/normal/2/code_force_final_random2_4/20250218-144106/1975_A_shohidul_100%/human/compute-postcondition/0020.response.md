Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `new` is a list starting from `a[1]` to the end of the list `a`, `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether not all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to `a[0]`, `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether not all consecutive elements in `new` satisfy the condition `new[i-1] <= new[i]` for `i` in range 1 to length of `new`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `n`, `new`, `check_all_new`, or `new_all`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was inside. All other variables retain their initial conditions.
