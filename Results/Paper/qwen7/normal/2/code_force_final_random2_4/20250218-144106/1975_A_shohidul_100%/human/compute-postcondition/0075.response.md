Output: **YES**

Explanation: The initial state provides the conditions for the variables but does not affect the execution of the `print('YES')` statement directly. The statement simply prints the string 'YES', which is explicitly provided within the `print` function. Therefore, regardless of the values of other variables like `i`, `n`, `a`, `new`, `check_all_new`, and `new_all`, the output will always be 'YES'.
