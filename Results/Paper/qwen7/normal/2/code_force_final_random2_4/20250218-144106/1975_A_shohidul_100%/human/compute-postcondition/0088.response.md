Output State: **`i` is 3; `new` is a slice from index 3 onwards of the original sequence `a`; `check_all_new` is True if all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise it is False; `new_all` is the result of the condition check [(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))]; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
