Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into a list of strings using spaces as delimiters, converts each string in the list to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
