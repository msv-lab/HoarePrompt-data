You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        check_all = all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])
        if check_all:
            print('YES')
        else:
            for i in range(1, n):
                if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                    new = a[i:]
                    check_all_new = all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])
                    new_all = all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])
                    if check_all_new and new_all:
                        print('YES')
                        break
                    else:
                        print('NO')
                        break



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t`, an integer `n`, and a list of `n` integers `a`. For each test case, it checks if the list `a` is non-decreasing (each element is less than or equal to the next). If `a` is non-decreasing, it prints 'YES'. If not, it checks if there exists a subsegment of `a` starting from index 1 that can be rearranged to form a non-decreasing sequence while maintaining the first element of `a`. If such a subsegment is found, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array and the array itself.

2. **Initial Check for Non-Decreasing Order:**
   - The program checks if the array is already in non-decreasing order using `check_all = all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])`.
   - If the array is already in non-decreasing order, it prints 'YES' and moves to the next test case.

3. **Handling Non-Native Non-Decreasing Arrays:**
   - If the array is not in non-decreasing order, the program iterates through possible splits of the array.
   - For each split at index `i`, it checks if the suffix (from index `i` to the end) can be placed before the prefix (from index 0 to `i-1`) such that the entire array becomes non-decreasing.
     - It checks if the first element of the prefix (`a[0]`) is greater than or equal to the first element of the suffix (`new[0]`).
     - It checks if the suffix itself is in non-decreasing order (`new_all`).

4. **Output:**
   - If a valid split is found, the program prints 'YES' and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no valid split is found after checking all possibilities, it prints 'NO'.

### Verification Against Test Cases

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`
   - This array cannot be made non-decreasing by any split, so the output should be 'NO'.
   - The program correctly identifies this and outputs 'NO'.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`
   - The array can be split at index 2 to get `[2, 2, 3]` and `[7, 9]`, and then rearranged to `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`, which is non-decreasing.
   - The program correctly identifies this and outputs 'YES'.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - The array is already in non-decreasing order, so the output should be 'YES'.
   - The program correctly identifies this and outputs 'YES'.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis and verification against the provided test cases, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts.
