Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `new` starts from `a[2]` and onwards, `check_all_new` is a boolean value determined by the condition `(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))`, `new_all` is a boolean value determined by the condition `all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])**.

Explanation: The code `new = a[i:]` updates the list `new` to start from index `i` (which is 2) and onwards. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `new` now starts from `a[2]`. The conditions for `check_all_new` and `new_all` remain the same but are now applied to the updated `new` list.
