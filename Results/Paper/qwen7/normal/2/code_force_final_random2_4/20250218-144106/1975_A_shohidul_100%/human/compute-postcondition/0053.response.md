Output: **YES**

Explanation: The initial state indicates that `check_all` is a boolean value determined by whether all elements in the list `a` from index 0 to n-2 are less than or equal to the next element. However, the `print('YES')` statement directly prints the string 'YES' regardless of the value of `check_all`. Therefore, the output will be 'YES'.
