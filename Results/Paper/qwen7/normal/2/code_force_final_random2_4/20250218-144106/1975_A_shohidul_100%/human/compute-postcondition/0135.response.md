Output: **NO**

Explanation:
- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `n` is an input integer greater than 3 but its specific value is not needed to determine the output of the `print('NO')` statement.
- `new` is a slice from index 3 to the end of the original sequence. Since `i` is 3, `new` would start from the 3rd element of the original sequence.
- `check_all_new` and `new_all` are boolean values but their specific values are not relevant to the output of the `print('NO')` statement.
- The `print('NO')` statement directly prints the string 'NO' without using any of the other variables or their conditions.

Therefore, the output is simply **NO**.
