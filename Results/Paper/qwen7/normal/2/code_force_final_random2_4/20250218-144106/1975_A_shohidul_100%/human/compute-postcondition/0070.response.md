Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a[0]` is greater than the current value of `a[1]`, and `new` is a list starting from `a[1]` to the end of the list `a`. If both `check_all_new` and `new_all` are true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `new_all` is false (indicating that `new[i-1]` is greater than `new[i]` for at least one `i` in the range 1 to the length of `new`), we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
