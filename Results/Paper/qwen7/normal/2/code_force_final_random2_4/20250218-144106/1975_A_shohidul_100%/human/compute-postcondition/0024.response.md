Let's analyze the given state and the loop step by step:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `n` must be at least 2
- `new` is a list starting from `a[1]` to the end of the list `a`
- `check_all_new` is a boolean value indicating whether all elements in `new` are greater than or equal to `a[0]`
- `new_all` is a boolean value indicating whether all consecutive elements in `new` satisfy the condition `new[i-1] <= new[i]` for `i` in range 1 to length of `new`

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `2`.

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged within the loop.

3. **List `new`:**
   - `new` is defined as a list starting from `a[1]` to the end of the list `a`.
   - This definition does not change within the loop.

4. **Booleans `check_all_new` and `new_all`:**
   - These booleans retain their values unless explicitly changed within the loop body.
   - Since no information is provided about changes to these booleans within the loop, they remain the same.

### Conclusion:
- The only variable that changes within the loop head is `i`.
- `i` will be incremented to `2` at the start of the next iteration.
- `n` remains at least 2.
- `new` remains the same.
- `check_all_new` and `new_all` retain their previous values.

### Updated State:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `new` is a list starting from `a[1]` to the end of the list `a`, `check_all_new` retains its previous value, `new_all` retains its previous value**
