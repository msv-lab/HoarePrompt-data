Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the input `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` until `i < n`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be able to reach 1, and `n` must be at least 2 (since `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`).

3. **Check the Given States**:
   - `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer.
   - `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether there exists at least one pair of consecutive elements in `a` from index 0 to n-2 such that the first element is greater than the second element.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, `i` must be set to 1.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 2.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` to 1 and `n` to be at least 2.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2**
