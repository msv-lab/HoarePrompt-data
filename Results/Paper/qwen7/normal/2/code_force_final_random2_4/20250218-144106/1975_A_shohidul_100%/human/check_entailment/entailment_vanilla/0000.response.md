### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check for Sorted Array:**
   - The program first checks if the entire array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order using `check_all = all([a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)])`.
   - If the array is already sorted, it prints 'YES'.

2. **Finding the First Discrepancy:**
   - If the array is not sorted, the program finds the first index `i` where `a[i-1] > a[i]`.

3. **Checking Possible Swaps:**
   - For this index `i`, the program considers the subarray `new = a[i:]` and checks two conditions:
     - `check_all_new = all([a[0] >= new[i] for i in range(len(new))])`: This condition ensures that the first element of the original array `a[0]` is greater than or equal to every element in the subarray `new`.
     - `new_all = all([new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, len(new))])`: This condition ensures that the subarray `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If both conditions are met, it means that swapping the prefix `a[:i]` with the suffix `a[i:]` would result in a sorted array, and thus the program prints 'YES'.
   - If either condition fails, it means that no such swap can make the array sorted, and the program prints 'NO'.

4. **Loop Structure:**
   - The loop structure ensures that the program only performs the necessary checks and breaks out of the loop once a decision is made.

Given the above steps, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if the array can be sorted by splitting and swapping parts of the array.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if the array can be sorted by the specified operations.

**Correctness: True**
