Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `palka`.

2. **Understand the postcondition**: 
   - `d.get(i)` is either incremented by 1 or set to 1 if it was `None`.
   - `pl` includes `i` if it was not already in `pl`.
   - `i` is the next element in `palka` after `i_val`.

3. **Determine the state changes**:
   - Since `i` is the next element in `palka` after `i_val`, `i` will be the next value in `palka` that hasn't been processed yet.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that there are more elements in `palka` to process.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be the next element in `palka` after `i_val`.
   - `palka` will be the same as before, but without the current `i` since it has been processed.
   - `d.get(i)` might have been incremented or set to 1.
   - `pl` might include `i` if it was not already in `pl`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `i` is the next element in `palka` after `i_val`, and the other conditions remain the same.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`d.get(i)` is either 1 (if `d.get(i)` was initially `None`) or incremented by 1 (if `d.get(i)` was not `None`), `pl` includes `i` if it was not already in `pl`, and `i` is the next element in `palka` after `i_val`. If `i` was not in `pl` before the execution of the if statement, then `pl` now includes `i`.**
