Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `pl` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `pl`. The values of `t`, `w`, `ln`, and `palka` remain unchanged from their initial states.
