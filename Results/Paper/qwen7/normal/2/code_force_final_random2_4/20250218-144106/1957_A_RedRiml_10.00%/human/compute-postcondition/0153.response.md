Based on the initial state provided:

- `shapes` is equal to the number of elements in `pl`.
- `pl` must contain only indices where the corresponding value in `d` is greater than or equal to 3.

To determine what will be printed, we need to understand the relationship between `shapes` and `pl`.

Since `shapes` is defined as the number of elements in `pl`, and `pl` contains only indices where the corresponding value in `d` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` will be the count of such indices in `d`.

However, without the actual content of `d`, we cannot determine the exact number of elements in `pl` and thus the exact value of `shapes`. Therefore, we can only describe `shapes` as the count of indices in `d` that meet the condition.

Output: **shapes (where shapes is the count of indices in d that have a value greater than or equal to 3)**
