Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the list of stick lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n consists of integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        pl = []
        
        d = {}
        
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        
        shapes = 0
        
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += 1
        
        print(shapes)
        
    #State: Output State: `shapes` is equal to the number of unique elements in `palka` whose count in `d` is greater than or equal to 3, `d` is a dictionary where each key from the list `palka` is mapped to its count in `palka`, and `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they appeared.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `shapes` will be equal to the number of unique elements in `palka` whose count in the dictionary `d` is greater than or equal to 3. The dictionary `d` will hold the counts of each key from the list `palka`, and the list `pl` will contain all unique elements from `palka` in the order they appeared, as no modifications are made to `pl` within the loop body other than appending new unique elements.
