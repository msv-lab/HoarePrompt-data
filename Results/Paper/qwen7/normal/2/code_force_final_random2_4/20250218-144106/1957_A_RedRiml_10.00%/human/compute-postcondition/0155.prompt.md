Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, w is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(w):
    ln = int(input())
    palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
    pl = []
    d = {}
    for i in palka:
        if d.get(i) == None:
            d[i] = 1
        else:
            d[i] += 1
        if i not in pl:
            pl.append(i)
    shapes = 0
    for j in pl:
        if d[j] >= 3:
            shapes += 1
    print(shapes)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `shapes` is 3, `j` is 3, and every element `j` in the list `pl` satisfies `d[j] >= 3`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `shapes` is 3, `d` is a dictionary where each key from the list `palka` is mapped to its count in `palka`, and `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they appeared.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `shapes` will be 3 because the loop increments `shapes` by 1 for each iteration where the condition `d[j] >= 3` is met. The dictionary `d` will still hold the counts of each key from the list `palka`, as no changes are made to it within the loop body other than the condition check. The list `pl` will contain all unique elements from `palka` in the order they appeared, as no modifications are made to `pl` within the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `shapes` is equal to the number of elements in `pl`, `pl` must contain only indices where the corresponding value in `d` is greater than or equal to 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
