Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is a list with at least one element, `d` is a dictionary, and `pl` now contains the first element of `palka` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `pl.append(i)` appends the first element of `palka` (denoted as `i`) to the list `pl`. Since `i` is the first element of `palka`, `pl` now includes this element. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
