Output State: **`shapes` is 0**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `shapes` to 0. The initial state of `d` (a dictionary) and `pl` (a list) remains unchanged because the code does not modify these variables. Therefore, the only variable affected by the given code is `shapes`, which is set to 0.
