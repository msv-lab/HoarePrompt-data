Output State: **`i` is an input integer, `n` is the first input integer, `m` is the second input integer, `k` is the third input integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `s` is 0, `c` is `k * k / 2`**.

This means that the value of `c` is calculated as `k * k / 2`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
