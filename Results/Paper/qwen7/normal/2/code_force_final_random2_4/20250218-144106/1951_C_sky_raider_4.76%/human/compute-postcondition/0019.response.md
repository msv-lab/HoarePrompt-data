Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `c` is the sum of `c + l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `k` is `k - n * s`, `s` is `min(m, k - n * s)`.

In this final state, the variable `i` will have reached the end of the range defined by `n`, meaning the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `c` will hold the cumulative value of `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for each iteration, where `s` is updated at the start of each iteration as the minimum of `m` and the remaining value of `k`. The variable `k` will be reduced by `n * s` over the course of the loop, and `s` will be adjusted accordingly at the beginning of each iteration based on the current value of `k`.
