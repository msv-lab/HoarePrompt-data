Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `s` is 0, `c` is `k * k / 2`**.

The value of `c` is calculated as `k * k / 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
