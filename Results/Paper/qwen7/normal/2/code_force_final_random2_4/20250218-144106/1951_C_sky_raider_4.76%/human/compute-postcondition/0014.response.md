Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `c` is `c + l[1] * s - s * s / 2`
   - `k` is `k - 2 * s`
   - `s` is `min(m, k - s)`

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged because the problem does not specify any change to `n` within the loop body.
   - The values of `c`, `k`, and `s` are derived from the loop body but are not directly modified by the loop itself. Therefore, they remain the same.

5. **Final state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` is 3
   - `n` must still be greater than 1 (unchanged)
   - `c` remains `c + l[1] * s - s * s / 2`
   - `k` remains `k - 2 * s`
   - `s` remains `min(m, k - s)`

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `c` is `c + l[1] * s - s * s / 2`, `k` is `k - 2 * s`, `s` is `min(m, k - s)`**
