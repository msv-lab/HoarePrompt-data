Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is equal to `n`
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 3
   - `c` is the sum of `c + l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`
   - `k` is `k - n * s`
   - `s` is `min(m, k - n * s)`

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range defined by `n`.
   - Since `i` is equal to `n` at the end of the previous iteration, the loop condition `i < n` is no longer true.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - The only variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
   - Since the loop has completed all its iterations, `i` should now be equal to `n`.

Given these points, we need to adjust the states of `i` and `n` to reflect the fact that the loop has completed.

**Final State**:
- `i` is equal to `n`
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 (unchanged)
- `c` remains the same as it is already computed
- `k` remains the same as it is already computed
- `s` remains the same as it is already computed

So, the adjusted state is:

**State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `c` is the sum of `c + l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `k` is `k - n * s`, `s` is `min(m, k - n * s)**.
