Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The variable `i` was initially set to 0 and remains unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 0, while `n`, `m`, and `k` are now integers obtained from the user input.
