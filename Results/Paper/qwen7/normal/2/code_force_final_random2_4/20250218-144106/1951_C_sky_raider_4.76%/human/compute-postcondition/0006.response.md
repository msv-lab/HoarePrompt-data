Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(n)`. This means the loop will iterate based on the value of `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The initial value of `i` is given as `0`.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, the value of `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

4. **List the variables that need adjustment**: The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we need to adjust these values.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` is already set to `0`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
