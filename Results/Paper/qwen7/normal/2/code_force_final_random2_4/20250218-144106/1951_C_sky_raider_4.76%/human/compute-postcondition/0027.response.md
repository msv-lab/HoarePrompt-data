Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - `i` should start at 0 (the default value for the `range` function).
   - `n` should be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

3. **Consider the other variables**:
   - `m`, `k`, `c`, `s`, and `l` are not directly involved in the loop condition and their values do not affect whether the loop will execute or not. They are part of the loop body and will be updated inside the loop.

4. **Formulate the required state**:
   - `i` should be 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**State:**
**`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
