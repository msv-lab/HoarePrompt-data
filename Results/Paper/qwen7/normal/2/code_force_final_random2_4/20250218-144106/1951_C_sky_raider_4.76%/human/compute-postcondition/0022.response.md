Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `c` is the sum of `c + l[i] * s - s * s / 2` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `k` is updated to `k - n * s`, `s` is `min(m, k - n * s)`**

Explanation: The code reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that `n`, `m`, and `k` are now input integers. The values of `i`, `c`, `l`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial state, except that `k` is updated to `k - n * s`. Additionally, `s` is recalculated as `min(m, k - n * s)`. The initial value of `i` is still equal to `n`, and the expression for `c` remains the same but hasn't been evaluated yet.
