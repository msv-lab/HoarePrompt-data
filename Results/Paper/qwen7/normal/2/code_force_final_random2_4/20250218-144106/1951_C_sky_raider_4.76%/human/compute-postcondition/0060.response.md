Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `c` is `c + l[2] * s - s * s / 2`**.

Explanation: The variable `c` is updated by adding the expression `l[i] * s - s * s / 2` to its current value. Here, `i` is 2, so `l[i]` becomes `l[2]`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
