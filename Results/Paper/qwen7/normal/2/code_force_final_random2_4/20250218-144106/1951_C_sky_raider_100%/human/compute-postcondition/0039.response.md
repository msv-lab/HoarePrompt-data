Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`.**

Explanation: The line `s = min(m, k)` assigns the minimum value between `m` and `k` to the variable `s`. Since `m` and `k` are not defined in the initial state, `s` will take the minimum value between them. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
