Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `t` is `s * (l[0] + 1)`, `s` is `min(m, k - 3 * s)`, `c` is `c + s * (l[3] + t)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `c` by adding `s * (l[i] + t)` to it. Given that `i` is 3, `c` is updated to `c + s * (l[3] + t)`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `t`, `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
