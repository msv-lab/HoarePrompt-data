Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `t` is `s * (l[0] + 0)`
   - `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`
   - `c` is `s * (l[0] + 0)`
   - `k` is `k - s`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and increases by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 0.

5. **Update the other variables**:
   - `t` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the loop.
   - `s` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the loop.
   - `c` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the loop.
   - `k` is updated to `k - s`, so at the start of the next iteration, `k` will be `k - s - s = k - 2s`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `t` is `s * (l[0] + 0)`, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, `c` is `s * (l[0] + 0)`, `k` is `k - 2s`**
