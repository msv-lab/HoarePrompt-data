### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the list of ticket prices `a`.

2. **Sorting the List**: The list `l` (which is the same as `a`) is sorted. This step is unnecessary because the algorithm does not rely on the order of the prices but rather on the cumulative effect of purchasing tickets.

3. **Initialization**: Variables `t`, `s`, and `c` are initialized to 0. `t` will store the cumulative sum of tickets purchased, `s` will store the number of tickets to be purchased on the current day, and `c` will store the cumulative cost.

4. **Main Loop**: The main loop iterates through each day:
   - `s` is set to the minimum of `m` and `k`. This ensures that no more than `m` tickets are purchased on any single day.
   - `c` is updated by adding the cost of the tickets purchased on the current day plus the cumulative increase in price due to previous purchases (`t`).
   - `t` is incremented by `s`, representing the cumulative number of tickets purchased.
   - `k` is decremented by `s`, representing the remaining tickets to be purchased.

5. **Output**: The final value of `c` is printed, which represents the minimum amount of money needed to purchase exactly `k` tickets.

### Analysis:

The logic in the program is sound and follows the problem statement correctly. The sorting step is unnecessary since the algorithm does not depend on the order of the ticket prices. The main loop correctly handles the constraints and updates the cumulative cost and ticket count appropriately.

### Conclusion:

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

### Correctness:
**True**
