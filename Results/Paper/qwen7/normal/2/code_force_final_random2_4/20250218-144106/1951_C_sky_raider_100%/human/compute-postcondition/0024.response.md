Based on the initial state provided, let's break down the variables and their values:

1. **`i`**: It is explicitly stated that `i` is equal to `n`.
2. **`n`**: It is explicitly stated that `n` is greater than 0.
3. **`t`**: It is defined as `s * (l[0] + n - 1)`. Here, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k - (n-1) * s`.
4. **`s`**: It is defined as the minimum value between `m` and `k - (n-1) * s`.
5. **`c`**: It is defined as the sum of `c + s * (l[j] + t - s * j)` for all `j` from 0 to `n-1`. This means `c` accumulates the sum of the expression for each `j` in the range.
6. **`k`**: It is defined as `k - n * s`.

Given these definitions, the `print(int(c))` statement will print the integer value of `c`, which is the cumulative sum of the expression `s * (l[j] + t - s * j)` for all `j` from 0 to `n-1`.

Output: **c (where c is the cumulative sum of the expression s * (l[j] + t - s * j) for all j from 0 to n-1)**
