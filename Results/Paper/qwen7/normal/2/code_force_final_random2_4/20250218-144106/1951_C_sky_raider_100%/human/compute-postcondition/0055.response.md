Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the input value, `m` is the second input value, `k` is the third input value, `l` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `t` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `t` to 0. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, or `l`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
