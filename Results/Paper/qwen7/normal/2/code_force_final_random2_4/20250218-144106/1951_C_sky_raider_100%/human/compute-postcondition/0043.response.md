Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`.
   - `k` is decreased by `s`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 0.

5. **Consider the effect of the loop body (omitted)**:
   - The loop body does not directly affect `i` or `n`, but it might affect other variables like `s`, `m`, and `k`. However, since we are only adjusting the states of objects in the loop head, we do not need to consider these changes here.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0**
