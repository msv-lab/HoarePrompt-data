Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `c` will be the sum of `s * (l[i] + t)` for each iteration where `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, `t` will be the cumulative sum of `s` from all iterations, and `k` will be the remaining value after subtracting `s` for each iteration.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations:
- The variable `i` will be equal to the input integer `n`.
- The variable `c` will hold the total accumulated value, which is the sum of `s * (l[i] + t)` for each iteration, where `s` is the smaller of `m` and `k`.
- The variable `t` will be the sum of all `s` values used in the iterations.
- The variable `k` will be reduced by the total amount of `s` used in the iterations, starting from its initial value down to whatever remains after the last iteration.
