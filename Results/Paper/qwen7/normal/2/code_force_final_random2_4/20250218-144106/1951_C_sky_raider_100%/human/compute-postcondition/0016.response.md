Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `t` is `s * (l[0] + 1)`, `s` is `min(m, k)`, `c` is `c + s * (l[1] + t)`, `k` is `k - 3s`**

Explanation: The code `k -= s` subtracts the value of `s` from `k`. Given that `s` is `min(m, k)`, the new value of `k` is `k - 3s`. All other variables remain unchanged.
