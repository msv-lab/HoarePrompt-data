Output State: **`c` is increased by `s * (l[i] + t)`, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, `n` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `c` by adding `s * (l[i] + t)` to its current value. Here, `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k`, and `l[i] + t` is a calculated value. The initial conditions that `n` must be greater than 0 and `s` is the minimum value between `m` and `k` remain unchanged.
