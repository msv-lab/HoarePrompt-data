Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine the number of possible initial arrays `a` of size `n` consisting of only `1` and `-1` such that the sorted prefix sum array `p` matches the given sorted prefix sum array.
   - The prefix sum array `p` is obtained by sorting the prefix sums of `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function aims to compute the number of ways to form the prefix sums leading to the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.
   - It uses dynamic programming with a DP array `dp` where `dp[j]` represents the number of ways to achieve a prefix sum `j - offset`.
   - The function iterates through each element of `p` and updates the DP array accordingly.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input from stdin and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`, the size of the array `n`, and the sorted prefix sum array `p` for each test case.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the result.

### Detailed Analysis of `func_1`

- **Initialization**:
  - `dp` is initialized to `[0] * (2 * n + 1)` with `offset = n`. This means `dp[j]` will store the number of ways to achieve a prefix sum `j - n`.
  - `dp[n]` is set to `1` because starting with an empty array has one way to achieve a prefix sum of `0`.

- **DP Transition**:
  - For each position `i` in the prefix sum array `p`, the function updates the DP array.
  - For each valid `j` in the DP array, it considers moving to `j + 1` and `j - 1` with appropriate modulo operations to handle large numbers.

- **Final Calculation**:
  - The final prefix sum `final_sum` is calculated as `p[-1] + offset`.
  - The function returns `dp[final_sum]`, which should give the number of ways to achieve the given sorted prefix sum array.

### Verification

To verify the correctness, let's consider the examples provided in the problem statement:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `n = 1`, `p = [0]`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - Explanation: There is no way to get a sorted prefix sum of `[0]` from an array of `1` and `-1`.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `n = 1`, `p = [1]`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Explanation: The only possible array is `[1]`.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: `n = 3`, `p = [-1, 1, 2]`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - Explanation: There is no way to get a sorted prefix sum of `[-1, 1, 2]`.

4. **Example 4**:
   - Input: `n = 5`, `p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - Explanation: The possible arrays are `[1, -1, 1, -1, -1]`, `[1, -1, -1, 1, 1]`, and `[-1, 1, 1, -1, 1]`.

5. **Example 5**:
   - Input: `n = 5`, `p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1]`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Explanation: The only possible array is `[-1, -1, -1, -1, 1]`.
