Output State: **`dp` remains equal to `new_dp`, `i` remains 2, `n` remains at least 1, and `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` if `j + 1 <= 2 * n`. If the condition `j + 1 > 2 * n` does not apply, `new_dp` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates `new_dp[j - 1]` to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` only if `j + 1 <= 2 * n`. Since the initial conditions state that `new_dp[3]` is updated under this condition, the same logic applies here. If `j + 1 > 2 * n`, `new_dp` remains unchanged. All other variables (`dp`, `i`, `n`) remain as per the initial conditions.
