Output State: **`index` is 5 + `data[index]`, `n` is `data[index]`, `t` is `t - 1`, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the elements in `data` starting from `index` to `index + data[index] - 1` into integers, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(data[index], p)` appended with `result`, `index` is increased by `data[index]`.**

Explanation:
- `index` is initially set to `5 + n`, where `n` is an integer from `data[2]`. After the code, `index` is updated to `5 + data[index]`.
- `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[index]`.
- `p` remains unchanged as it is a list of integers obtained by converting the elements in `data` starting from `index` to `index + n` into integers.
- `data` remains unchanged as it is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace.
- `results` is updated to include the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.
- `index` is increased by `n`, which is now `data[index]`.

All other variables remain in their initial state except for those explicitly updated.
