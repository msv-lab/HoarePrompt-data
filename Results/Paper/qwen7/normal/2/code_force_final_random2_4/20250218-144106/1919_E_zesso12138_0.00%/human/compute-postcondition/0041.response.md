Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n + 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `dp` is equal to `new_dp`
   - `i` is 1

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - The loop starts from `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 each time until `i` reaches `n + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.
   - The value of `n` does not change within the loop head; it remains as it was at the start of the loop.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `dp` remains unchanged as there is no mention of `dp` being updated in the loop head.
   - `i` changes from 1 to 2.
   - `n` remains as it was at the start of the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`dp` is equal to `new_dp`, `i` is 2, `n` must be the same as before**
