Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
   - `dp` is equal to `new_dp`
   - `i` is still 2
   - `n` remains at least 1
   - `new_dp` is a list of 0s with a length of `2 * n + 1`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented to 3 (since the loop starts from 1).
   - `n` remains at least 1, so it does not change.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `n` remains at least 1.
   - The other variables (`dp`, `new_dp`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`dp` is equal to `new_dp`, `i` is 3, `n` remains at least 1, and `new_dp` is a list of 0s with a length of `2 * n + 1`**.
