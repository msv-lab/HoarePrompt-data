Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution attempts to solve the problem using dynamic programming but has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Initialization and Transition:**
   - The `dp` array is initialized with an offset of `n`, which is not appropriate for the problem's requirements.
   - The transitions in the DP function (`func_1`) do not correctly simulate the generation of prefix sums from the array `a`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Final Sum:**
   - The final sum calculation `final_sum = p[-1] + offset` is incorrect. The offset should be adjusted based on the actual values in `p` rather than a fixed value.

3. **Dynamic Programming Logic:**
   - The logic inside the nested loops for updating the `dp` array is flawed. It does not correctly model the generation of prefix sums from the array `a`.

4. **Input Handling:**
   - The `func_2` function reads input from stdin, but the way it processes the data is not aligned with the problem's requirements. Specifically, the indices used to read the input are not correctly managing the data split.

To correctly solve this problem, one would need to use combinatorial methods to count the number of valid arrays `a` that can produce the given sorted prefix sums `p`. This involves understanding the constraints and properties of the prefix sums and using combinatorial techniques to count the valid configurations.
