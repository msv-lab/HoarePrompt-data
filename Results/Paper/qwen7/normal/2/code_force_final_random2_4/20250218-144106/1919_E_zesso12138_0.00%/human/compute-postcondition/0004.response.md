Output State: **`index` is 2, `t` is an integer obtained from `data[1]`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000 representing the size of the hidden array `a`, `p` is a list of n integers where |p_i| <= n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `index` by 1. Initially, `index` was 1, so after executing `index += 1`, `index` becomes 2. The values of `t`, `n`, `p`, and `data` remain unchanged.
