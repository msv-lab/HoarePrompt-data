Output State: **The program returns the value of `dp` at index `final_sum`, where `final_sum` is `p[-1] + offset` and `dp` reflects the cumulative effect of adding adjacent values from the previous state, taken modulo `MOD`.**

This means the program returns the element in the `dp` list at the position specified by `final_sum`, which is calculated as `p[-1] + offset`, considering the `dp` list has undergone all necessary iterations reflecting the cumulative addition of adjacent values modulo `MOD`.
