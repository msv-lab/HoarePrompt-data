Reasoning:
1. The problem requires us to determine the number of possible initial arrays \(a\) that can produce a given sorted prefix sum array \(p\).
2. The provided code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
3. `func_2` reads the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
4. `func_1` uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to form the prefix sum array \(a\) that would result in the given sorted prefix sum array \(p\).
5. The key steps in `func_1` involve initializing a DP array, updating it iteratively based on the current and next values, and finally returning the value at the position corresponding to the last element of \(p\).

To verify correctness, we need to ensure:
- `func_1` correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid arrays \(a\).
- `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results.

Given the problem constraints and the execution summary, both functions appear to be designed to solve the problem correctly. The dynamic programming approach in `func_1` seems appropriate for counting the number of valid arrays, and `func_2` correctly handles reading input and calling `func_1` for each test case.

Therefore, based on the provided information and the logical structure of the code, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
