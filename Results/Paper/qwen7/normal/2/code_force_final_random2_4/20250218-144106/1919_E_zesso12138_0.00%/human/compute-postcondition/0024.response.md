Output State: **`index` is 6 + `data[5]` + `data[index]`, `n` is an integer value equal to `data[index]`, `t` is greater than 0, `p` is now a list of integers obtained by converting the elements in `data` starting from `index` to `index + n - 1` into integers, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(data[index], p)` appended with `result`, and `index` is increased by `n`.**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `index` is `6 + data[5]`.
- `n` is an integer value equal to `data[index]`.
- `t` remains greater than 0.
- `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the elements in `data` from `index` to `index + n - 1` into integers.
- `data` remains a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace.
- `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(data[index], p)` appended with `result`.
- After executing `index += n`, `index` is increased by the value of `n`.
