Output State: **`dp` is equal to `new_dp`, `i` is 2, `n` is unchanged, `new_dp` is a list of 0s with length 2 * n + 1.**

Explanation: The code initializes `new_dp` as a list containing 0s, with a length of `2 * n + 1`. Since `n` is unchanged from its previous value, `new_dp` is a list of 0s with a specific length. The values of `dp`, `i`, and `n` remain as they were in the initial state.
