Output State: **`index` is 1, `t` is an integer obtained from `data[index]`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000 representing the size of the hidden array `a`, `p` is a list of n integers where |p_i| <= n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[index]` to `t`. Since `index` was initially 0, after the assignment, `index` is incremented to 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `p`, and `data` are updated based on the input, but their descriptions remain as per the initial state with the new value of `t` being the integer obtained from `data[1]`.
