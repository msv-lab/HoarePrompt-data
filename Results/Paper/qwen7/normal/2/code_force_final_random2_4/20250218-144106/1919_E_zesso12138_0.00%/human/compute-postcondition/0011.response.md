Output State: **`index` is 4 + n, `n` is an integer from `data[2]`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000 representing the size of the hidden array `a`, `p` is a list of n integers where |p_i| <= n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `p` is now a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`**.

Explanation: The code `result = func_1(n, p)` calls the function `func_1` with arguments `n` and `p`, and assigns the return value of this function call to the variable `result`. The values of `index`, `t`, `n`, `p`, and `data` remain unchanged from their initial states. The `results` list is updated to include the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.
