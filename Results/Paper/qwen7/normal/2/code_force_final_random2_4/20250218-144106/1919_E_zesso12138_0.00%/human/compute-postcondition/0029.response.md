Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable in this case is `res`, which comes from the `results` list.
   - The loop body is omitted, but we need to consider what `res` represents. Since `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, `res` will be one of these return values.

2. **Understand the Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list.
   - For each iteration, `res` takes on the value of an element from `results`.

3. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - `index` is increased by the sum of all `n` values encountered during the loop iterations.
   - `t` is 0.
   - `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the elements in `data` starting from the initial `index` up to the last `index + n - 1` into integers.
   - `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace.
   - `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `res` is derived from `results`, and `results` is populated by the loop, we need to ensure that `results` is properly initialized and contains the correct values.
   - `index` will be updated during the loop based on the sum of all `n` values.
   - `t` will be decremented to 0.
   - `p` will be constructed based on the segments of `data` specified by `index` and `n`.
   - `data` remains unchanged.

### Conclusion:

To ensure the loop can execute correctly, we need to initialize `results` such that it contains the expected return values from `func_1(n, p)`. We also need to ensure that `index` is set to the correct initial value and that `p` is constructed appropriately.

### Final Answer:

State: **`results` is a list of return values from `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, `index` is set to the initial value, `t` is 0, `p` is a list of integers obtained by converting the elements in `data` starting from the initial `index` up to the last `index + n - 1` into integers, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace.**

This ensures that the loop can execute and produce the desired results.
