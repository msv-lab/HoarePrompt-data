Postcondition: `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `D[out_aa]` is greater than or equal to -8, `E[out_aa]` is either decreased by 1 or less than or equal to 0, `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1 if `E[out_aa]` is not greater than 0, `m` is `m + 1`, `in_aa` is the next element in the slice `aa[m+1:]`, `out_aa` is the corresponding element in the slice `aa[:n - (m + 1)]`.
