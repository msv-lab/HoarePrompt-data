Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `D` is a Counter object containing the intersection of elements in `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `E` is updated to be the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`, `m` is `m + 1`, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` (which is the sum of the values in `D`) is greater than or equal to `k` else 0, `n` is the integer input, `in_aa` and `out_aa` are indices processed in the loop, `aa` is a list of indices starting from index `m` to the end of the list, `bb` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `cnt_aa` is updated to be a Counter object of the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object of the list `bb`, `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`, `C` is the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`.
Code of the loop:
for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
    if D[out_aa] > 0:
        if E[out_aa] > 0:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        else:
            D[out_aa] -= 1
            pairs_in_D -= 1
            C[out_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[out_aa] -= 1
    if C[in_aa] > 0:
        D[in_aa] += 1
        pairs_in_D += 1
        C[in_aa] -= 1
    else:
        E[in_aa] += 1
    fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 and is now greater than or equal to -7, `E[out_aa]` remains unchanged and is less than or equal to 0, `m` is incremented by 1, `fnd` is now `fnd + 1` if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k` else `fnd`, `n` remains unchanged, `in_aa` and `out_aa` remain unchanged, `aa` remains unchanged, `bb` remains unchanged, `cnt_aa` remains unchanged, `cnt_bb` remains unchanged, `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D` plus 1, `C` is the difference between `cnt_bb` and `D`, `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1 if `C[in_aa]` was greater than 0, otherwise `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1 and is now greater than 2, `C[in_aa]` is decremented by 1 and is now at least -2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `D[out_aa]` is greater than or equal to -7, `E[out_aa]` is less than or equal to 0, `m` is incremented by 1, `fnd` is updated based on the condition involving `pairs_in_D`, `n` remains unchanged, `in_aa` is the next element in the slice `aa[m+1:]`, `out_aa` is the corresponding element in the slice `aa[:n - (m + 1)]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`; `D[out_aa]` is either greater than or equal to -8 or -10, `E[out_aa]` is either decreased by 1 and less than or equal to 0, or decreased by 13 and less than or equal to 0, `m` is `m + 1`, `in_aa` is the next element in the slice `aa[m+1:]`, `out_aa` is the corresponding element in the slice `aa[:n - (m + 1)]`, `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1 if `E[out_aa]` was originally greater than 0, `C[in_aa]` is decremented by 1, and `pairs_in_D` is incremented by 1 if `C[in_aa]` was originally greater than 0; `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1; `fnd` is either incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, else it remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
