Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `D` is a Counter object counting the intersection of elements in `aa` and `bb`, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object counting the first `m` elements of `aa`, `E` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`, `C` is `cnt_bb - D`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from the input split by spaces, `aa` is a list of strings where each string is an element from the input split by spaces, `bb` is a list of strings from the new input split by spaces, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object counting the elements of `bb`, `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D >= k` else 0.
Code of the loop:
for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
    if D[out_aa] > 0:
        if E[out_aa] > 0:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        else:
            D[out_aa] -= 1
            pairs_in_D -= 1
            C[out_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[out_aa] -= 1
    if C[in_aa] > 0:
        D[in_aa] += 1
        pairs_in_D += 1
        C[in_aa] -= 1
    else:
        E[in_aa] += 1
    fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `D` is a Counter object counting the intersection of elements in `aa` and `bb`, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object counting the first `m` elements of `aa`, `E` is a Counter object representing the difference between `cnt_aa` and `D`, `C` is `cnt_bb - D`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from the input split by spaces, `aa` is a list of strings where each string is an element from the input split by spaces, `bb` is a list of strings from the new input split by spaces, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object counting the elements of `bb`, `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`, `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D >= k` else 0, `fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D >= k` else 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1; `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1; `pairs_in_D` is adjusted based on the condition (increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D` >= `k`, otherwise decreased by 1); `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1; `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1; `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `fnd` is increased by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged; `pairs_in_D` is adjusted by 1; the other variables (`in_aa`, `out_aa`, `C`, `D`, `E`) remain in their original conditions.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
