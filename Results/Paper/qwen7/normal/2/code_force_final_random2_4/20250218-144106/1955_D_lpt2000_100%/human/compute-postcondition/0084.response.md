Output State: **`D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 and is now greater than or equal to -3, `E[out_aa]` remains unchanged and is less than or equal to 0, `m` remains unchanged, `fnd` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `in_aa` remains unchanged, `out_aa` remains unchanged, `aa` remains unchanged, `bb` remains unchanged, `cnt_aa` remains unchanged, `cnt_bb` remains unchanged, `pairs_in_D` remains unchanged, `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `C[out_aa] += 1` increases the value of `C[out_aa]` by 1. Since `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 and is now greater than or equal to -2, after executing the code, `D[out_aa]` will be decreased by another 1, making it greater than or equal to -3. All other variables remain unchanged.
