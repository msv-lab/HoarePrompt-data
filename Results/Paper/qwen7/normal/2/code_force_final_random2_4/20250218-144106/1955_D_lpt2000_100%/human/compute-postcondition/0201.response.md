Postcondition: `in_aa` and `out_aa` will take on new values from the `zip` function. `pairs_in_D` will be adjusted by 1 in either case. If `C[in_aa]` is greater than 0, then `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1, `C[in_aa]` is decreased by 1, and either `out_aa` is decreased by 1 if `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0, or `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1 if `E[out_aa]` is not greater than 0. If `C[in_aa]` is not greater than 0, then `E[in_aa]` is increased by 1, and `out_aa` is decreased by 1 if `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0, or `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decreased by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1 if `E[out_aa]` is not greater than 0.
