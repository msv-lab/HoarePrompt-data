Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` must be greater than or equal to 2; `u` is an input integer; `v` is an input integer; and `v` is not equal to `tree[-1]`; `tree` is now `[v, u]`**.

Explanation: The code `tree.appendleft(v)` appends the value of `v` to the left end of the list `tree`. Given the initial state, `u` is the first element of `tree`, which means before appending `v`, `tree` is `[u]`. After appending `v` to the left, `tree` becomes `[v, u]`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
