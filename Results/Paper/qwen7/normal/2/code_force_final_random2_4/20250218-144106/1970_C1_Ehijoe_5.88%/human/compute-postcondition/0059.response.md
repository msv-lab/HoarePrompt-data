Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `tree` is a deque with the first element as `u`.**

Explanation: The code `tree.appendleft(u)` appends the value of `u` to the left end of the deque `tree`. Since `u` is an input integer, the deque `tree` now has its first element as `u`. All other variables remain unchanged.
