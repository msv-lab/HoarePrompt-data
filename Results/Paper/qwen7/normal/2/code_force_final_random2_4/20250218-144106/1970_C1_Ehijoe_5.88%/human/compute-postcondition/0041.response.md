Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `u` is an integer obtained from the input, `v` is an integer obtained from the input, `tree` contains the element `u`**.

Explanation: The code `tree.append(u)` appends the integer `u` to the list `tree`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `v` remain unchanged. `u` is an integer obtained from the input, and `v` is also an integer obtained from the input. Therefore, the updated state includes the new element `u` in the list `tree`.
