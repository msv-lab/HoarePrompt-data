Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `u` is appended to the list `tree`, `v` is appended to the list `tree`**.

The code `tree.append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `tree`. Since `u` was already appended to the list `tree` in the initial state, and `v` is an input integer, both `u` and `v` are now elements of the list `tree`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
