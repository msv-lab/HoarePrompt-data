Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values at the start of the loop**:
   - `i` is 0 (as given in the postcondition).
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 (as given in the postcondition).

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i` to `n-1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the state based on the loop condition**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1.
   - `n` must still be greater than or equal to 2.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` becomes 1.
   - `n` must still be greater than or equal to 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
