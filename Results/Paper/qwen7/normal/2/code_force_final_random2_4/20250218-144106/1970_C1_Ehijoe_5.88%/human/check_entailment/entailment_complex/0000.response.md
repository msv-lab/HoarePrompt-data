### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Representation**: The program correctly constructs the tree using a deque. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the tree is essentially a path (since it has exactly two leaves), and the deque is used to maintain the order of nodes as they are added.

2. **Starting Node and Index Calculation**: The starting node is correctly identified, and its index within the deque is calculated. This index helps in determining the distance of the starting node from the beginning and end of the deque.

3. **Move Calculation**: The program calculates the minimum possible moves to the left (`idx`) and to the right (`n - idx - 1`). This is correct since the tree is linear, and the moves are limited by the number of rounds `t`.

4. **Winning Condition**: The program checks if any of the calculated moves are odd. If so, it concludes that Ron wins (since Ron makes the first move and odd-numbered moves would allow him to make the last move). Otherwise, Hermione wins.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the case where `t` is less than the required moves by taking the minimum of `t` and the actual number of moves needed. This ensures that the game is played optimally up to `t` moves.

6. **Input and Output**: The program reads the necessary inputs and outputs the correct winner based on the calculations.

Given these points, the program logic aligns with the problem statement and the provided examples. There are no logical errors or inconsistencies in the code.
