Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `u` is an input integer, and `v` is an input integer. If `v` equals the first element of `tree`, then `v` is appended to the right end of `tree`. Otherwise, `v` is appended to the left end of `tree` if the first element of `tree` equals the last element of `tree`. If neither condition is met, `v` is appended to the right end of `tree`. Additionally, `u` is appended to the list `tree`.
