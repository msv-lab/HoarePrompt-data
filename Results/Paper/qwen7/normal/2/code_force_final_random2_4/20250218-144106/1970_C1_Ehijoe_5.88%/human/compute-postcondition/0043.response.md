Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `u` is an integer obtained from input, `v` is an integer obtained from input, `tree` is a list with one element `v`.**

Explanation: The code `tree.append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `tree`. Since `v` is an integer obtained from input, it is added to the list. The values of `i`, `n`, `u`, and the condition on `n` remain unchanged.
