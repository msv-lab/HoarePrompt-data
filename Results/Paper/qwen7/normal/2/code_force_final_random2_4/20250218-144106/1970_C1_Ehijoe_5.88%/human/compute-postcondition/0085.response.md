Postcondition: `start` is an input integer, `i` is `start-1`, the deque `tree` is empty, `idx` is an error because `tree` is empty, `moves` is `[min(start-1, idx), min(start-1, n - idx - 1)]`. If there exists at least one move in `moves` that is odd, then the postcondition remains as specified in the if part. Otherwise, both elements in `moves` are even numbers.
