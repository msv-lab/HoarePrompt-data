Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `tree` has `v` appended to its left end.**

The code `tree.appendleft(v)` appends the integer `v` to the left end of the `tree` list. The values of `i`, `n`, `u`, and the condition on `n` remain unchanged.
