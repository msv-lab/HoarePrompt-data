#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, t is an integer such that t = 1, u and v are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n.
def func_1():
    n, t = map(int, input().split())
    tree = deque()
    empty = True
    for i in range(n - 1):
        u, v = map(int, input().split())
        
        if empty:
            tree.append(u)
            tree.append(v)
            empty = False
        elif v == tree[0]:
            tree.appendleft(u)
        elif v == tree[-1]:
            tree.append(u)
        elif u == tree[0]:

    #State: Output State: The deque `tree` will contain all the integers from 1 to `n` in some order, and the value of `i` will be `n-1`.
    #
    #Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations (from `i=0` to `i=n-2`), the variable `i` will have the value `n-1`. The deque `tree` will contain all the integers from 1 to `n` that were input during the loop's iterations, possibly in a different order due to the conditions under which elements are appended to the deque. The initial conditions for `u` and `v` will have been updated according to the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop.
    start = int(input())
    idx = tree.index(start)
    moves = [min(t, idx), min(t, n - idx - 1)]
    if any([(move % 2 == 1) for move in moves]) :
        print('Ron')
        #This is printed: Ron
    else :
        print('Hermione')
        #This is printed: Hermione
    #State: Postcondition: `start` is an input integer, `i` is `start-1`, the deque `tree` is empty, `idx` is an error because `tree` is empty, `moves` is `[min(start-1, idx), min(start-1, n - idx - 1)]`. If there exists at least one move in `moves` that is odd, then the postcondition remains as specified in the if part. Otherwise, both elements in `moves` are even numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a tree structure represented by a series of edges and determines whether a certain number of moves (specified by `t`) will result in an odd or even position for a given starting node (`start`). If any of the calculated moves are odd, it prints 'Ron'; otherwise, it prints 'Hermione'. The function reads the number of nodes (`n`), the number of moves (`t`), and the edges of the tree, then finds the starting node and calculates the moves based on its position within the tree.
