Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `u, v = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them to integers, assigning them to `u` and `v` respectively. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. The condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 is still valid. The values of `u` and `v` are specific inputs, hence they are described as "an input integer" each.
