Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `empty` is True, `t` is 1, `u` is an input integer between 1 and `n`, `v` is an input integer between 1 and `n`, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2×10^5; `tree` is an empty deque.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    u, v = map(int, input().split())
    if empty:
        tree.append(u)
        tree.append(v)
        empty = False
    elif v == tree[0]:
        tree.appendleft(u)
    elif v == tree[-1]:
        tree.append(u)
    elif u == tree[0]:
        tree.appendleft(v)
    elif u == tree[-1]:
        tree.append(v)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, and the list `tree` is updated as follows:
- If `v` is equal to the first element of `tree`, then `tree` now has the first element as `u` and the second element as the original first element of `tree`.
- Otherwise, if the last element of `tree` is `u`, then the last element of `tree` remains `u`.
- Otherwise, if `u` is equal to `tree[0]`, then `tree` is now `[v, u]`.
- Otherwise, `tree` now has one additional element which is `v`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `u` and `v` are integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers. If `v` is equal to the first element of the list `tree`, then `u` is appended to the left end of `tree`. If `v` is not equal to the first element of the list `tree`, then `v` is appended to the left end of `tree` if `v` is not already the last element of `tree`. Otherwise, `tree` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `u` is an input integer, and `v` is an input integer. If `v` equals the first element of `tree`, then `v` is appended to the right end of `tree`. Otherwise, `v` is appended to the left end of `tree` if the first element of `tree` equals the last element of `tree`. If neither condition is met, `v` is appended to the right end of `tree`. `u` and `v` are added to the list `tree`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
