Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `u` is an integer from input, `v` is an integer from input, `tree` contains the integer `u`**.

Explanation: The code appends the integer `u` to the list `tree`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `v` remain unchanged. `u` is specifically mentioned as an integer obtained from input, so it is included in the output state.
