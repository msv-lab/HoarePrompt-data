### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves a game where Alice and Bob take turns exchanging wallets and removing one coin from their current wallet until one of them cannot make a valid move.
   - The key observation is that the game's outcome depends on the parity (odd or even nature) of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.

2. **Game Dynamics**:
   - If `abs(a - b)` is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves. This means that whenever Alice removes a coin and chooses whether to swap wallets or not, Bob can do the opposite and maintain the same parity of the difference. Eventually, Alice will be forced to make a move when her wallet is empty, and Bob can continue until Alice cannot make a move.
   - If `abs(a - b)` is odd, Alice can always make a move that changes the parity, forcing Bob into a losing position eventually.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates the absolute difference between `a` and `b` using `abs(a - b)`.
   - It then checks if this difference is even or odd using the condition `if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`. If true, it prints 'Bob', otherwise it prints 'Alice'.
   - However, there is a critical flaw in the logic. The program assumes that the game will always end with the player whose turn it is being forced to lose, but it does not account for the fact that the game can end in a way where the player whose turn it is still has a valid move. Specifically, if `a` and `b` are such that `abs(a - b)` is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, but if Alice has more coins than Bob, she can always force Bob into a losing position by ensuring the difference remains even.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles all edge cases where `a` and `b` are within the specified range (1 to \(10^9\)).
   - However, the logic provided in the program does not correctly handle the scenario where the game ends with a player having a valid move. For example, if `a = 3` and `b = 1`, Alice can force Bob into a losing position by ensuring the difference remains even.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the winner based on the game rules and the parity of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. The program incorrectly assumes that the player whose turn it is will always lose if the difference is even, which is not always the case.

**Correctness: False**

### Final:
Final: **False**
