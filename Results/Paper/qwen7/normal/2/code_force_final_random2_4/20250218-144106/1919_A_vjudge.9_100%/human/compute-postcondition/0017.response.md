Output State: **`t` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `a, b = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them into integers, assigning them to `a` and `b` respectively. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
