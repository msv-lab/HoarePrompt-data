Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `a` and `b` are assigned the values of two integers input by the user separated by a space.**

Explanation: The code takes two integers as input from the user, splits them by a space, and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. The values of `t`, `i`, and the precondition that `i` is 1 remain unchanged.
