### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics:**
   - Each player starts with `a` and `b` coins respectively.
   - Players take turns, with Alice starting first.
   - On each turn, a player can either swap wallets with the opponent or keep them.
   - After choosing, the player removes one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The key insight here is that the game essentially boils down to parity (even or odd) of the difference between the number of coins Alice and Bob have.
   - If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, Bob wins because he can always mirror Alice's moves.
   - If the absolute difference is odd, Alice wins because she can force the difference to become even eventually, giving Bob no choice but to make the difference even again, and so on until Bob runs out of moves.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`.
   - It checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even using `abs(a - b) % 2 == 0`.
   - If true, it prints 'Bob', otherwise it prints 'Alice'.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic correctly identifies the winning condition based on the parity of the difference.
   - The implementation accurately reflects the game's rules and the derived strategy.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution based on the game's rules and the derived strategy.

**Correctness: True**
