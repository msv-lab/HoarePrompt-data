Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(t)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < t`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` must be at least 1.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is an input integer.

4. **Update the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, the condition `i < t` will be true if `t > 0`. Given that `t` must be at least 1, it is safe to assume `t > 0`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1.
   - The value of `t` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be updated to 1.
   - `t` remains the same (at least 1).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`t` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**.
