Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each case includes a positive integer t such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, two positive integers a and b such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9. The function returns a result based on the values of a, b, and t for each test case.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing values for t, a, and b. For each set of these values, the function performs some operation (not specified here) and returns a result corresponding to the input values of a, b, and t.
