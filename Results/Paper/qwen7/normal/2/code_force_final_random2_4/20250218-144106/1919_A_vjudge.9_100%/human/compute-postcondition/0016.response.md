Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < t`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be at least 1.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `a` and `b` are input integers.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - For `i` to be incremented to 2, `t` must be at least 2 (since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is 2 and `t` is at least 2.

**Final State**:
State: **`t` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are input integers**
