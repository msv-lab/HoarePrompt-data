The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 1000) followed by \( t \) pairs of positive integers \( a \) and \( b \) (1 ≤ \( a, b \) ≤ 10^9). For each pair, it checks if the absolute difference between \( a \) and \( b \) is even or odd. If the difference is even, it prints 'Bob'; if odd, it prints 'Alice'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results for each case.
