Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the winner based on the game rules. The program checks whether the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd and decides the winner based on that condition. However, this approach is incorrect because the actual winning strategy depends on the parity (odd or even nature) of the initial number of coins each player has, rather than just the difference.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the following:

- If either `a` or `b` is odd, the player with the odd number of coins will always win if both players play optimally.
- If both `a` and `b` are even, the player who goes second (Bob) will win.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if a % 2 != 0 or b % 2 != 0:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')
```

This version correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the initial number of coins each player has.
