Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct as per the problem statement.

2. **Game Logic**: For each test case, the program takes two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. It then checks whether the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd:
   - If the absolute difference is even, it prints 'Bob'.
   - If the absolute difference is odd, it prints 'Alice'.

3. **Optimal Play**: The logic implemented is consistent with the optimal strategy described in the problem statement. The key observation here is that the game essentially boils down to the parity (even or odd nature) of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. If the difference is even, Bob can always force the game into a state where the difference becomes odd, ensuring he wins. Conversely, if the difference is odd, Alice can force the game into a state where the difference becomes even, ensuring she wins.

4. **Output**: The program correctly outputs 'Bob' or 'Alice' for each test case based on the parity of the difference between `a` and `b`.

Given that the program correctly implements the logic and produces the expected output based on the problem description, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
