### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code.

#### Problem Description:
- Alice and Bob take turns removing one coin from their respective wallets until one of them cannot make a move.
- The player who cannot make a move loses.
- The winner is determined based on the parity (even or odd) of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets after all moves.

#### Provided Code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

#### Annotated Code:
- The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`.
- It then checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd.
- If the difference is even, it prints 'Bob'.
- If the difference is odd, it prints 'Alice'.

#### Analysis:
1. **Initial Assumption**: The initial assessment claims that the program is incorrect because it does not consider the optimal strategy of both players. However, the problem description states that both players play optimally, which means they will always make the best possible move to avoid losing.

2. **Key Insight**: When both players play optimally, the game will end when both wallets are empty. The key observation here is that the game will always end in a draw if both players play optimally, meaning no one wins. However, the problem asks us to determine who would win if both play optimally, and the logic provided in the code seems to align with the problem's expected outcome.

3. **Game Logic**:
   - If `abs(a - b)` is even, it implies that the number of moves required to empty both wallets will be even.
   - If `abs(a - b)` is odd, it implies that the number of moves required to empty both wallets will be odd.
   - Since both players play optimally, the player who makes the last move (odd number of moves) will lose, and the other player will win.

Given this, the logic in the provided code is actually correct. The program correctly identifies the winner based on the parity of the absolute difference between `a` and `b`.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate. The provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the optimal strategy of both players.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
