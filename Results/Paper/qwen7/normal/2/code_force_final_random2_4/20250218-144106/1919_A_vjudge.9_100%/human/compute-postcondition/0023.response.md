Output State: `t` must be equal to the total number of iterations the loop has executed, `i` is `t-1`, `a` and `b` are input integers assigned the values of two integers input by the user separated by a space during the last iteration of the loop. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even, the loop prints 'Bob'. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd, the loop prints 'Alice'. The values of `a` and `b` from the last iteration are retained as they are.
