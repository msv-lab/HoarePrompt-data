Output State: **`t` is a non-empty value decreased by 1, `r()` has been called, `a` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `b` is `[0, 0, v]`, `v` is `y - x`**.

This means that the value of `v` is calculated as the difference between `y` and `x`. The other variables retain their previous states as described in the initial state.
