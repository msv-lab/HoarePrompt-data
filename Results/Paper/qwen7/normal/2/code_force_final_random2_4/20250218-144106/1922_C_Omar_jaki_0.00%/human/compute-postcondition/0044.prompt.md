Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a non-empty value decreased by the total number of iterations of the loop, `r()` has been called, `a` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `b` is `[0, 0, v, 2v, 4v], u` is the return value of `r()`
Code of the loop:
while u:
    u -= 1
    c, d = r()
    if c < d:
        print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
    else:
        print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is a non-empty value decreased by the total number of iterations of the loop, `r()` has been called twice, `a` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `b` is `[0, 0, v, 2v, 4v]`, `u` is the return value of `r()` and is now `u - 1`, `c` is the first return value of `r()`, `d` is the second return value of `r()`. If the first return value of `r()` is less than the second return value of `r()`, `c` remains less than `d`. Otherwise, the first return value of `r()` is greater than or equal to the second return value of `r()`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is a non-empty value decreased by the total number of iterations of the loop, `r()` has been called twice, `a` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `b` is `[0, 0, v, 2v, 4v]`, `u` is the return value of `r()` and is now `u - 2`, `c` is the first return value of `r()`, `d` is the second return value of `r()` and is at least 1, `u` is decreased by 1, `c` is updated with the first return value of `r()`, `d` is updated with the second return value of `r()`
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is a non-empty value decreased by the total number of iterations of the loop, `r()` has been called twice, `a` is [0, 0, 0, 0], `b` is [0, 0, v, 2v, 4v], `u` is at least 1 and decreased by 1, `c` and `d` are updated to the return values of `r()`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
