Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is reduced to the first element of the input split by spaces, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of n non-negative integers in strictly increasing order, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and the function `r` is defined as a lambda function that maps integers from input split by spaces.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    r()
    a = -1000000000.0, *r(), 2000000000.0
    b = [0, 0]
    for w, x, y, z in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
        v = y - x
        b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
    print(b, 'B')
    u, = r()
    while u:
        u -= 1
        c, d = r()
        if c < d:
            print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
        else:
            print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `t` is a non-empty value decreased by the total number of iterations of the loop, `r()` has been called three times, `a` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `b` is `[0, 0, v, 2v, 4v]`, `u` is the return value of `r()` and is now `u - 3`, `c` is the first return value of `r()`, `d` is the second return value of `r()`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `t` will be the initial non-empty value decreased by the total number of iterations (which is the number of times the loop executed). The function `r()` is called three times during these iterations. The list `a` remains unchanged as it was initialized to `[0, 0, 0, 0]` and is not modified within the loop. The list `b` also remains unchanged as it is only used for printing calculations and is not modified. The variable `u` is the return value of `r()` and is decreased by the number of iterations, which is 3 in this case. The variables `c` and `d` are updated to the return values of `r()` at each iteration but their final values are not specified without knowing the exact return values from `r()`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Output State: `total` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `a` is a list with at least 4 elements, the first element of `a` is -1000000000.0, the second, third, and fourth elements of `a` are any values, `b` is a list where each element is the sum of the previous two elements plus `v` if certain conditions are met during each iteration of the loop, `u` is `False`, `c` and `d` are the results of the function `r()` after the loop has executed all its iterations. If `c` is less than `d`, no further changes are made; otherwise, no further changes are made.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `u` will be `False` as it gets decremented to zero in each iteration. The lists `a` and `b` will retain their values from the last iteration of the loop, and `c` and `d` will hold the most recent values returned by the function `r()`. No further updates will be made to these variables outside the loop.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Output State: `total` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `a` is a list with at least 4 elements, `v` is `y - x` for each iteration, the first element of `b` is `b[0] + v + v` from the previous iteration, `b` now includes the second last element updated to `b[-2] + v` for each iteration, `c` and `d` are the return values of function `r()`, `u` is `False`.

**Explanation:**
- The loop continues to run as long as `u` is `True`. After the loop executes 3 times, `u` becomes `False`.
- Since the loop stops when `u` is `False`, it will not execute any further iterations.
- Therefore, the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished is the same as the state after the loop executes 3 times, where `u` is `False`.

The other variables (`total`, `a`, `v`, `b`, `c`, and `d`) remain unchanged from their state after the third iteration because the loop does not modify them further once `u` becomes `False`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
