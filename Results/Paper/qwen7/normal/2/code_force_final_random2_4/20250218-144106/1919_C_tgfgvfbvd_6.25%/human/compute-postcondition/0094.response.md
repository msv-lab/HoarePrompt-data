Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `y` is equal to `n-1`, `x` is equal to `n`, `c` is a non-negative integer, `a` is the maximum value among `l[1]` to `l[n-1]` that satisfies `l[y] > l[y-1]`, and if no such values exist, `a` remains 0, `b` is the second maximum value among `l[1]` to `l[n-1]` that satisfies `l[y] > l[y-1]`, and if no such values exist, `b` remains 0.**

Explanation: The line `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The values of `y`, `x`, `c`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the input operation. The precondition that `n` is greater than 3 is preserved, and the conditions for `a` and `b` remain the same.
