Output State: **`y` is 0, `x` is `n + 1`, `b` is 0, `c` is 0, `a` is `l[0]`, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `y` is explicitly assigned the value `0`. All other variables (`x`, `b`, `c`, `a`, `l`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
