Postcondition: `y` is a value such that after the loop runs, `y` will be `n - 1`, `x` is `y + 1`, and `l` is a list of elements where:
- If `l[x] - a` is greater than or equal to `l[x] - b`, then `a` is set to `l[x]`.
- Otherwise, `b` is set to `l[x]`.
Additionally, the current value of `l[x]` remains greater than `a` and `b`.
