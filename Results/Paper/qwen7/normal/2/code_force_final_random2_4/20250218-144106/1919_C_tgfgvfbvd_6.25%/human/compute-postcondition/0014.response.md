Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `y` is 2; `b` is the value at index 2 of list `l`.**

Explanation: The code `b = l[y]` assigns the value at index `y` (which is 2) of the list `l` to the variable `b`. Since `y` is 2, `b` will be the third element of the list `l`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged, and `y` is still 2.
