Output State: **Postcondition: y is n-1, x is n, n is greater than 1, a is the minimum value among l[0] to l[n-2], b is the maximum value among l[0] to l[n-2], c is the count of elements in l[0] to l[n-2] that are neither equal to a nor b but satisfy certain conditions, and c is also the count of times the condition `l[x] > a and l[x] > b` is met during the loop execution.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `y` will still be `n-1` because the loop increments `x` from `y+1` to `n-1`. The variable `x` will be `n` after the last iteration since the loop stops when `x` reaches `n`. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. The variables `a` and `b` are updated based on the conditions inside the loop to ensure `a` is the minimum value and `b` is the maximum value among `l[0] to l[n-2]`. The variable `c` counts how many times the element `l[x]` is neither equal to `a` nor `b` but satisfies specific conditions within the loop.
