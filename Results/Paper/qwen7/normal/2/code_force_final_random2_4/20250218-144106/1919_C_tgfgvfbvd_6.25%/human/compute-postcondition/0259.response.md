Postcondition: **`y` is `n - 1`, `x` is `n`, `a` is updated based on the following conditions: if `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, then `c` is increased by 1 if `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, otherwise `a` remains unchanged if `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b` and `a - l[x]` is less than or equal to `b - l[x]`, and if `l[x]` is less than both `a` and `b` and `a` is less than `l[x]`, then `b` is set to the value of `l[x]`. If the condition `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b` is not met, then `b` is set to the value of `l[x]`.**
