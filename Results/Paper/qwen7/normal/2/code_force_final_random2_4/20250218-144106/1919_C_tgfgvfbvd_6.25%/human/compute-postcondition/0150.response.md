Output State: **`y` is `n - 1`, `x` is `n`, `a` is the element at index `n` in list `l`, `l` is a list of elements.**

Explanation: The code `a = l[x]` assigns the element at index `x` (which is `n`) in the list `l` to the variable `a`. The values of `y` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
