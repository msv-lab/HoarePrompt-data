Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is an empty list.
   - `ans` is either -1 or 0.
   - `i` is 29.
   - `u` is not 0.
   - `v` is 0.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates from 29 down to -1 with a step of -1.

3. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` is being decremented in each iteration.

4. **Determine the New Value of `i`:**
   - Since the loop starts at `i = 29` and decreases by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `28`.

5. **Check Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to -1.
   - `u` is not 0, so it does not affect the loop continuation.
   - `v` is 0, but it does not affect the loop continuation either.

6. **Adjust the State:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that changes is `i`.
   - Therefore, we need to update `i` to `28`.

7. **Post-Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - `t` remains an empty list.
   - `ans` remains either -1 or 0.
   - `u` remains not 0.
   - `v` remains 0.

Based on the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`t` is an empty list, `ans` is either -1 or 0, `i` is 28, `u` is not 0, `v` is 0**.
