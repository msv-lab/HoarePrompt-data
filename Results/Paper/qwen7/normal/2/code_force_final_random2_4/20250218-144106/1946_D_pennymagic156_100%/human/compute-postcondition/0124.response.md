Output State: **`t` is an empty list, `ans` is either -1 or 0, `i` is 28, `u` is `a[0] >> 28 & 1`, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> 27 & 1) for val in a]` updated with the new value of `a[28] >> 27 & 1` and it is even and non-zero, `op` is 1, `cnt` is 3, `val` is `a[28]`, `op` is `op ^ (val >> i & 1)` which evaluates to 1 since `val >> i & 1` is 1.**

Explanation: The operation `op ^= val >> i & 1` updates `op` by performing a bitwise XOR operation between `op` and the result of `val >> i & 1`. Given that `i` is 28 and `val` is `a[28]`, the expression `val >> i & 1` evaluates to 1 because shifting `a[28]` right by 28 bits and then performing a bitwise AND with 1 will give the least significant bit of `a[28]`, which is 1 in this case. Since `op` was initially 0, `op ^= 1` changes `op` to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
