Output State: **`a` is a list that must have at least one element; `op` is updated by performing `op ^= val >> i & 1`.**

Explanation: The code `op ^= val >> i & 1` updates the value of `op` using the bitwise XOR (`^=`) operator. It first performs a bitwise right shift (`>>`) on `val` by `i` positions, then applies a bitwise AND (`&`) with 1 to get the `i`-th bit of `val`, and finally XORs the result with `op`. Since the initial values of `val`, `i`, and `op` are not provided, the only thing we can say for certain is that `op` is updated according to the given operation. The list `a` remains unchanged.
