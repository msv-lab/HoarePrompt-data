Output State: **`a` is not an empty iterable, `cnt` is increased by 1, `op` is the result of `op ^= next_val >> i & 1 ^ val >> i & 1`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `op` by performing a bitwise XOR operation (`^=`) between the current value of `op`, the result of shifting the next element in `a` (`next_val`) right by `i` positions and masking it with `1`, and the result of shifting `val` right by `i` positions and masking it with `1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `a` remains an iterable, `cnt` is increased by 1, and `op` is updated according to the new bitwise operation.
