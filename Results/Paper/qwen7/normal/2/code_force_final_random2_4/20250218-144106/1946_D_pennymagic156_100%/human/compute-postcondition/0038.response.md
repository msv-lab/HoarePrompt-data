Output State: **`t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 0, `u` is 0, `v` is 0, `op` is False, `ai` is 0**.

Explanation: The line `a, t = t, []` swaps the values of `t` and `[]`. Since `t` initially contains the result of `ai ^ val` for each `val` in `a`, after the swap, `t` becomes an empty list. The values of `ans`, `i`, `u`, `v`, `op`, and `ai` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment.
