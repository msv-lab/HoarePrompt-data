Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

    2 2
    
    2 3
    
    5 0
    
    0 1 2 2 1

Output

    2
    2
    1
    2
    3
    -1
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

# Functions with Execution Summary:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline
for _ in range(int(input())):
    print(func_5())

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function processes input from the user for multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer t indicating the number of cases, followed by t pairs of integers n and x, and then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. It returns a list containing t lists, where each inner list consists of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function accepts no parameters and returns an integer input by the user.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function reads input from standard input, including an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and x (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ x < 2^30), and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < 2^30). After processing the input, the function returns two integers n and x from the first test case, separated by a space.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    return input().strip()
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function reads the first line of input, strips any trailing whitespace, and returns it as the number of test cases 't'.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    (n, x) = func_3()
    a = func_1()
    (t, ans) = ([], -1)
    for i in range(29, -1, -1):
        (u, v) = (x >> i & 1, sum([val >> i & 1 for val in a]))
        if u == v == 0:
            continue
        if u == 0:
            if v % 2:
                return ans
            else:
                op = ai = 0
                for val in a:
                    op ^= val >> i & 1
                    ai ^= val
                    if not op:
                        t.append(ai)
                        ai = 0
                (a, t) = (t, [])
        elif v % 2:
            continue
        elif v:
            op = cnt = 0
            for val in a:
                op ^= val >> i & 1
                if not op:
                    cnt += 1
            ans = max(ans, cnt)
        else:
            break
    return max(ans, len(a))
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function processes a list of integers `a` and an integer `x` to find the maximum count of consecutive zeros in the binary representation of the elements in `a`. If certain conditions are met, it returns -1 or 0, otherwise, it returns the maximum value between -1 or 0 and the length of the list `a`.
