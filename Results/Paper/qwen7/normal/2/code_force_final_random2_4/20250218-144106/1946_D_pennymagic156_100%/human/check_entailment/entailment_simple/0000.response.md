Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input as specified by the problem statement.
2. The function `func_5` processes each test case as follows:
   - It first extracts `n` and `x` using `func_3()`.
   - It then reads the array `a` using `func_1()`.
   - It iterates over the bits from 29 down to 0, checking conditions based on the value of `x` and the array `a`.
   - For each bit position, it calculates the required conditions and updates the result accordingly.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value found, which is the desired output.
3. The logic within `func_5` seems to correctly implement the solution to the problem, ensuring that the constraints and requirements are met.
4. The program structure and the functions defined seem to align with the problem requirements and the expected behavior.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct based on the provided information and the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
