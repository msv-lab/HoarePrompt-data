Output State: **`a` is not an empty iterable, `cnt` is increased by 2, `op` is the result of `op ^= next_val >> i & 1 ^ val >> i & 1`**.

Explanation: The variable `cnt` was already increased by 1 in the initial state. The code `cnt += 1` increases `cnt` by another 1, making it increased by 2 in total. The value of `op` remains unchanged as no operation directly affecting `op` is performed in the given code snippet.
