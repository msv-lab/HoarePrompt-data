Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, n and x are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ x < 2^30. Additionally, the subsequent line for each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30.
def func_1():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers entered by the user for each test case, where each list contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes input from the user for multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer t indicating the number of cases, followed by t pairs of integers n and x, and then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. It returns a list containing t lists, where each inner list consists of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains two integers n and x such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ x < 2^30; the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30; and the third line is empty or contains additional input which should be ignored.
def func_2():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer input by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns an integer input by the user.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains two integers n and x separated by a space, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ x < 2^30; the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n separated by spaces, where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30; and the function does not return anything for the current function signature, implying that the main logic for solving each test case is implemented elsewhere.
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns two integers n and x separated by a space, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ x < 2^30.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from standard input, including an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and x (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ x < 2^30), and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < 2^30). After processing the input, the function returns two integers n and x from the first test case, separated by a space.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, n and x are integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^5 and 0 <= x < 2^30. Additionally, the subsequent input contains n integers representing the array a for each test case.
def func_4():
    return input().strip()
    #The program returns the first line of input after stripping any trailing whitespace, which represents the number of test cases 't'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads the first line of input, strips any trailing whitespace, and returns it as the number of test cases 't'.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, x is an integer such that 0 ≤ x < 2^30, and a is a list of n integers such that 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30 for all i from 1 to n.

    #State: Output State: `t` is an empty list, `ans` is the maximum value found during the loop execution, `i` is 0, `u` is `a[0] >> 0 & 1`, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> 0 & 1) for val in a]`.
    #
    #In this final state, after all iterations of the loop (from 29 down to 0), the list `t` remains empty because no elements were appended to it throughout the loop's execution. The variable `ans` holds the highest value among all counts of consecutive zeros found in the binary representation of the elements in `a`, as determined by the loop. The variable `i` reaches 0 after the last iteration. The variable `u` is the least significant bit of the first element in `a`, and `v` is the sum of the least significant bits of all elements in `a`.
    return max(ans, len(a))
    #The program returns the maximum value between ans and the length of list a.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list of integers `a` and an integer `x` to find the maximum count of consecutive zeros in the binary representation of the elements in `a`. If certain conditions are met, it returns -1 or 0, otherwise, it returns the maximum value between -1 or 0 and the length of the list `a`.
