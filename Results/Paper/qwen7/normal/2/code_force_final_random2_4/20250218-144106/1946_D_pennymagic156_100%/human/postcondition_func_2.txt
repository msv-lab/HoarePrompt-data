The function reads input from standard input, including an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and x (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ x < 2^30), and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < 2^30). After processing the input, the function returns two integers n and x from the first test case, separated by a space.
