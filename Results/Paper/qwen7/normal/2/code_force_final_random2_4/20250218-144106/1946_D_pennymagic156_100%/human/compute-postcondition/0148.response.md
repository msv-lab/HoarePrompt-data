Output State: **`a` is a list that must have at least one element; `ai` is updated by performing `ai ^= val`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ai ^= val` updates the value of `ai` by performing a bitwise XOR operation between `ai` and `val`. The initial state of `a` and `op` remains unchanged, but `ai` is modified according to the given operation.
