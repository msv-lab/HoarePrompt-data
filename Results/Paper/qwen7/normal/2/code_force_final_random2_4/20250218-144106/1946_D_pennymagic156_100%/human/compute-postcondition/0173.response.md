Output State: **`t` is an empty list, `ans` is either -1 or 0, `i` is 27, `u` is `(a[0] >> 27 & 1)`, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> 27 & 1) for val in a]`, at least one of `u` or `v` is not 0, and the current value of `v` is odd.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, their values remain unchanged from the initial state. The conditions involving `u` and `v` also remain valid as they are not altered by the `continue` statement.
