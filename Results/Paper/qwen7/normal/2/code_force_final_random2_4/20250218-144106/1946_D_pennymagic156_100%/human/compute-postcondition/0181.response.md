Output State: **`op` is updated by performing the bitwise XOR operation between its current value and the result of `val` right-shifted by `i` bits and then ANDed with 1, and the current value of `op` is false; `cnt` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Since `cnt` was previously false (or 0 in integer context), after this operation, `cnt` becomes 1. The value of `op` remains unchanged from its previous state, which is described as being updated by performing the bitwise XOR operation between its current value and the result of `val` right-shifted by `i` bits and then ANDed with 1.
