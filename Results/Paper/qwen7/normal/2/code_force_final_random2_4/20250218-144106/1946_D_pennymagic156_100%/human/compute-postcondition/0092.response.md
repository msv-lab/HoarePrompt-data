Output State: **`t` is a list containing `[ai, ai]`, `ans` is either -1 or 0, `i` is 28, `op` is 1, `ai` is `val ^ a[0]`, `u` is `a[0] >> 28 & 1`, `v` is the sum of `[(val >> 28 & 1) for val in a]`, `val` is the next element in the list `a`**

Explanation: The line `t.append(ai)` appends the value of `ai` to the list `t`. Since `ai` was already in the list `t` before this operation, now `t` contains two elements, both of which are `ai`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
