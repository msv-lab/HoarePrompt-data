Output State: **`t` is an empty list, `ans` is -1, `i` is 29, `u` is not 0, `v` is 0, and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are updated or affected by the `continue` statement, their previous values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged values of all variables and the indication that the loop continues.
