Output State: **`op` is False, `ai` is 0, `val` is the next element in `a` after `val_next`, `t` is a list containing ['ai ^ val_next', 'ai ^ val_next'], `ans` is -1, `i` is 28, `u` is 0, `v` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `op ^= val >> i & 1` modifies the value of `op`. Initially, `op` is `True`. The expression `val >> i & 1` shifts the bits of `val` to the right by `i` (which is 28) positions and then performs a bitwise AND with 1. Since `val` is the next element in `a` after `val_next`, shifting its bits 28 positions to the right and then ANDing with 1 will result in 0 because the lower 28 bits of any integer are 0 after such a shift. Thus, `val >> 28 & 1` evaluates to 0. The XOR operation `^=` between `op` (which is `True`) and 0 results in `False`. All other variables remain unchanged.
