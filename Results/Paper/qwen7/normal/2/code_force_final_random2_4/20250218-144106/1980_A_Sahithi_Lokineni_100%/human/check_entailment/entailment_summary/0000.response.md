Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The main issue lies in how the frequency of each difficulty level is counted and how the minimum number of additional problems needed is calculated.

1. The program initializes `d` using `defaultdict(default_value)`, but `default_value` is not defined. This will cause a `NameError`.
2. The program sets the initial counts for each difficulty level (`A` to `G`) manually, which is unnecessary because `defaultdict` should handle this.
3. The logic to calculate the minimum number of additional problems needed is flawed. It checks if the count of each difficulty level is less than or equal to `m` and then adds `m - d[val]` to `ans`. However, it should only add the difference if the current count is less than `m / n * total_difficulties`, ensuring that each round gets at least one problem of each difficulty level.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
