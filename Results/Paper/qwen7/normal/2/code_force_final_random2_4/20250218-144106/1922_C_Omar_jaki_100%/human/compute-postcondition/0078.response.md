Output State: **`u` is False, `c` is the return value of `r()`, `d` is the second return value of `r()`**

The code `c, d = r()` assigns the return values of the function `r()` to the variables `c` and `d`. Since the function `r()` has not been defined with specific return values, the values of `c` and `d` remain as the return values of `r()`. The variable `u` remains unchanged and is still `False`.
