Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 2 and 500, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `max` is updated to the minimum value between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`, and this minimum value is greater than the original `max`.
