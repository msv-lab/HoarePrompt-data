State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 500, and `t` must be greater than 0**.

Explanation:
- The loop `for _ in range(t):` will execute `t` times.
- For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer.
- Since `t` is given as an input integer between 1 and 500, it already satisfies being an integer and being within the specified range.
- However, to ensure the loop executes at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `t` must be an integer between 1 and 500 and must be greater than 0.
