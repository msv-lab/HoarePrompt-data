Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, and `max` is the minimum value between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`. If `min(a[i], a[i - 1]) > max`, then the condition holds true. Otherwise, the condition does not change.
