Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes input through multiple lines. It first reads an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and then reads n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function returns a value based on the processed data.**

Given the constraints, the function likely processes each test case defined by the integer n and the following n integers, performing some operation or returning a specific result based on the input data. However, without knowing the exact operation or return value, we can only describe the input processing and expected behavior in terms of handling test cases with specific n and a_i values.
