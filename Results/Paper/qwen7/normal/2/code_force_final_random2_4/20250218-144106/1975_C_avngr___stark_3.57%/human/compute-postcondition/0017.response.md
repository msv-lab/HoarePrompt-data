Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, and `max` remains the minimum value between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` if `min(a[i], a[i - 1]) > max`, otherwise `max` does not change.**
