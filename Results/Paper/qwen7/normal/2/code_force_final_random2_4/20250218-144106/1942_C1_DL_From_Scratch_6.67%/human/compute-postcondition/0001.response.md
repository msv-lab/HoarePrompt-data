Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (a common placeholder for an unused variable) and `T`. Since `_` is typically used as a throwaway variable in loops, we focus on `T`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `T` is greater than 0. Given that `T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 10^4\), the loop will definitely execute at least once.

3. **Adjust the State**: We need to ensure that `T` is set to a value that satisfies the condition for the loop to execute. Since `T` is obtained from `int(input())` and is guaranteed to be a positive integer within the specified range, we don't need to change its value explicitly. However, we need to reflect the fact that the loop will execute based on this value.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is simply ensuring that `T` is a positive integer as given.

**State:**
**`T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 10^4\)**

This ensures that the loop will execute at least once, given the constraints provided.
