Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user, `x` is an integer input from the user, `y` is an integer input from the user, `list0` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a single line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list called `list0`. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
