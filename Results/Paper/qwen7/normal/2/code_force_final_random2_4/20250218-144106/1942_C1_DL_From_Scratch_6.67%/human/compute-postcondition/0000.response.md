Output State: **`T` is an integer obtained from `int(input())`, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4. All other variables are not affected.**

This means that the variable `T` has been updated to an integer value obtained from user input, which is constrained to be between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. The other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of vertices) remain in their initial state as described in the precondition.
