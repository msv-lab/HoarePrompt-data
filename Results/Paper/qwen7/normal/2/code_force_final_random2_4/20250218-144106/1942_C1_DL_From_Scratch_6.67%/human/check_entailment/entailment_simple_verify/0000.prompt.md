You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `x - 2`, `num` will be equal to 1, and `count` will be equal to `x - 2`. The value of `n` will be as initially input by the user. The state of `T` will remain unchanged, and all other variables outside the loop will retain their initial or unchanged values from the preconditions.
    #
    #This conclusion is drawn based on the provided postconditions for the first three iterations. Since the loop runs `T` times, and given the postconditions, `count` increments by 1 each time the inner condition `num == 1` is met, which happens when `i` is `x - 2`. Therefore, after `T` iterations, `count` will be `x - 2`. The value of `i` will always be `x - 2` at the end of each iteration, and `num` will be 1, as per the last condition checked in the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program attempts to count the number of gaps between consecutive chosen vertices, but this approach does not guarantee the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
3
8 4 0
1 6 2 5
```

- Expected Output:
```
2
```

- Actual Output:
```
1
```

The program counts the number of gaps between consecutive chosen vertices, but it fails to consider the possibility of forming triangles using the remaining vertices in a way that maximizes the number of triangles. For example, in the given test case, the vertices 1, 6, 2, and 5 can form at most 2 non-intersecting triangles, but the program incorrectly outputs 1.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that we can form as many non-intersecting triangles as possible. This involves considering all possible ways to connect the chosen vertices and the remaining vertices to maximize the number of triangles. The current implementation does not account for this complexity.
