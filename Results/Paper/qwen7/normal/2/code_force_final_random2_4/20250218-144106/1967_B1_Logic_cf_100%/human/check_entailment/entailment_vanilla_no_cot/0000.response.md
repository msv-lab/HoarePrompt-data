Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. Let's analyze why:

1. **Condition Check**: The problem requires checking pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the provided code does not properly check this condition.

2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The current implementation calculates `ans = n` initially and then adds some values without properly iterating through all possible pairs \((a, b)\).

3. **Loop Logic**: The loop from `2` to `min(n, m)` is not sufficient to cover all valid pairs. It only checks a subset of possible values for \(b\), and even then, it does not correctly compute the number of valid pairs.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if they satisfy the given condition. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    return math.gcd(a, b)

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    ans = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                ans += 1
    return ans

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

func()
```

This corrected version iterates through all pairs \((a, b)\) and checks if they satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This ensures that all valid pairs are counted correctly.
