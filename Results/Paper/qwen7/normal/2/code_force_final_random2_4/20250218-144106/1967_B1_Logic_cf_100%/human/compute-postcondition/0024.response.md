Output State: `b` is any integer greater than or equal to 5, `n` is an integer such that `min(n, m)` is at least 5, `m` is an integer such that `min(n, m)` is at least 5, `ans` is the sum of the initial value of `ans` plus the sum of `(n + b) // (b * b)` for each `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `b` will be the next integer greater than or equal to 5, `n` and `m` will both be at least as large as the maximum value they reached during the loop's execution, and `ans` will be the initial value of `ans` plus the sum of the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` for each `b` starting from 2 up to the smaller of `n` and `m`.
