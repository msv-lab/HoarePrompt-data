Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is a string from input, `m` is a string from input**

Explanation: The code splits the input into two strings and assigns them to `n` and `m`. The value of `t` remains unchanged and is still 0. Therefore, `t` is 0, `n` is a string from the first part of the input, and `m` is a string from the second part of the input.
