Output State: **`ans` is updated to `ans + (n + b) // (b * b)`, `b` is updated to `b + 1`, `min(n, m)` remains the same**.

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding the integer division of `(n + b)` by `b * b` to the current value of `ans`.
- The value of `b` is incremented by 1.
- The value of `min(n, m)` remains unchanged as the loop does not modify `m`.
