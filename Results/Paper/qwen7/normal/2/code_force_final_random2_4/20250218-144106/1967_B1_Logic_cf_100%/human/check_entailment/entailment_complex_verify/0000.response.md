### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided program.

#### Problem Description:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)
```

#### Annotated Code:
- The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
- For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\).
- It initializes `ans` to \(n\).
- It iterates over \(b\) from 2 to the minimum of \(n\) and \(m\), and for each \(b\), it increments `ans` by \((n + b) // (b * b)\).
- Finally, it prints `ans`.

#### Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: `ans` is initialized to \(n\). This part seems fine as it starts with the trivial case where \(a = n\) and \(b = 1\).

2. **Loop Over \(b\)**: The loop iterates over \(b\) from 2 to the minimum of \(n\) and \(m\). For each \(b\), it increments `ans` by \((n + b) // (b * b)\).

   - The expression \((n + b) // (b * b)\) does not check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it simply adds a value based on \(n\) and \(b\), which is incorrect.

3. **Example Test Case**:
   - Consider \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\).
   - The valid pairs should be checked as per the problem statement.
   - Valid pairs include:
     - \((1, 1)\): \(1 + 1 = 2\), and \(\gcd(1, 1) = 1\), so \(2\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot 1\).
     - \((2, 1)\): \(2 + 1 = 3\), and \(\gcd(2, 1) = 1\), so \(3\) is not a multiple of \(1 \cdot 1\).
     - \((2, 2)\): \(2 + 2 = 4\), and \(\gcd(2, 2) = 2\), so \(4\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot 2\).

   - The program incorrectly adds \((n + b) // (b * b)\) to `ans` without checking the actual condition.

#### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It fails to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for each pair \((a, b)\).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not properly check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
