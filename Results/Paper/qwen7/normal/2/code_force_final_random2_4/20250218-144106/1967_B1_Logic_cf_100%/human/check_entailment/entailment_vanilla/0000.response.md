Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\).
2. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Given Program Analysis
The provided program is as follows:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)
```

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown
1. **Reading Input**:
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two space-separated integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `ans` is initialized to `n`. This initialization seems incorrect because it doesn't account for the condition involving `b`.

3. **Loop Over Possible Values of `b`**:
   - The loop iterates from `2` to `min(n, m)`.
   - For each `b`, it adds `(n + b) // (b * b)` to `ans`.

4. **Output**:
   - It prints the value of `ans` after processing all values of `b`.

### Issues Identified
1. **Incorrect Initialization**:
   - The variable `ans` should be initialized to `0` instead of `n` because we need to count valid pairs, not just the initial value of `n`.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not correctly implemented in the loop. The current implementation does not check this condition at all.

3. **Calculation**:
   - The expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` does not correctly represent the number of valid pairs for the given condition.

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if they satisfy the given condition. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def gcd(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
    return x

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        print(ans)

func()
```

### Conclusion
The original program is incorrect because it does not properly implement the required logic to count valid pairs. Therefore, the given program is **incorrect**.

Correctness: **False**
