You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 \cdot 10^6. It is also guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        
        ans = n
        
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: `ans` is the sum of `(n + b) // (b * b)` for all `b` in the range from 2 to the minimum of `n` and `m`, inclusive, and `b` equals the minimum of `n` and `m`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each containing two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \). For each test case, it calculates the sum of \((n + b) // (b * b)\) for all \( b \) in the range from 2 to the minimum of \( n \) and \( m \), and prints the result. If the input constraints are not satisfied, the function will not execute correctly.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Specifically, the program calculates `ans` using `(n + b) // (b * b)` which does not align with the problem statement's requirement that `a + b` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

To illustrate this, consider the test case `n = 10` and `m = 8`. According to the problem description, we need to count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that `1 ≤ a ≤ n`, `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

Let's manually check a few pairs:
- For (1, 1): `1 + 1 = 2`, and `gcd(1, 1) = 1`, so `2` is a multiple of `1 * 1`.
- For (2, 1): `2 + 1 = 3`, and `gcd(2, 1) = 1`, so `3` is not a multiple of `1 * 1`.
- For (2, 2): `2 + 2 = 4`, and `gcd(2, 2) = 2`, so `4` is a multiple of `2 * 2`.

The program incorrectly adds `(n + b) // (b * b)` to `ans` without checking if the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` holds true for each pair. This leads to an incorrect count of valid pairs.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is thus incorrect.
