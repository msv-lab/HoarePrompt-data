Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `ans` is the sum of `n` and the expression \((n + b) // (b * b)\) for all `b` in the range from 2 to `min(n, m)` inclusive.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(ans)
   ```

Given the initial state, the value of `ans` is determined by the formula:
\[ ans = n + \sum_{b=2}^{\text{min}(n, m)} \left( \frac{n + b}{b \cdot b} \right) \]

When the `print(ans)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `ans`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of n and the expression (n + b) // (b * b) for all b in the range from 2 to min(n, m) inclusive)**
