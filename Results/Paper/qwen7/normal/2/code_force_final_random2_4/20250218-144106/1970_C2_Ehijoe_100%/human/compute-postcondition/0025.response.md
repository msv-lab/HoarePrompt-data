Output State: **`nodes` is a dictionary, `key` is the next key in the `nodes` dictionary, `leaves` is a list with an additional element `key`.**

Explanation: The code appends the `key` to the `leaves` list. Since `key` is the next key in the `nodes` dictionary, it gets added to the `leaves` list, making the `leaves` list contain one more element, which is `key`. The `nodes` dictionary and the value of `key` remain unchanged.
