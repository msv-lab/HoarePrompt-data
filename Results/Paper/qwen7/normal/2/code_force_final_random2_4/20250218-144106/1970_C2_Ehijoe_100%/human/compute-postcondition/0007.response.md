Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `nodes[v]` now contains the value `[u]`**.

Explanation: The code `nodes[v].append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the list stored in `nodes[v]`. Initially, `nodes[v]` contains the value `v`. After executing the code, `nodes[v]` will contain the list `[v, u]`. However, since the initial state only mentions that `nodes[v]` contains `v`, we update it to say that `nodes[v]` now contains `[u]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
