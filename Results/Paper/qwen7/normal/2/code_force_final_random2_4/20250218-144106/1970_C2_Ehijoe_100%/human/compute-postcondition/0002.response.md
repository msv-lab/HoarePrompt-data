Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, and `empty` is True.**

The variable `empty` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The values of `n`, `t`, `edges`, and `start` remain unchanged from their initial states.
