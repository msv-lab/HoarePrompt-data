Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is greater than 1
   - `u` is an input integer (not needed for the loop condition)
   - `v` is an input integer (not needed for the loop condition)
   - `nodes[v]` now contains the value `[u]` (not needed for the loop condition)

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 1.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1**
