nodes is a list of integers representing the number of nodes in the tree, start is an integer representing the starting node for the round, and parent is an optional integer representing the parent node of the current node (used in the DFS traversal). Additionally, n (the number of nodes) satisfies 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, t = 1, and the edges and starting nodes are provided as specified in the problem description.
