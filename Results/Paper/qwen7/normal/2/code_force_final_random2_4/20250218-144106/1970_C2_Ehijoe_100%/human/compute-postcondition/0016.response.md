Output State: `i` is equal to `n - 2`; `n` is greater than 1; `u` is an integer that has been input at least once during the loop; `v` is an integer that has been input at least once during the loop; for every node `v` in `nodes`, the list `nodes[v]` contains all nodes `u` that are connected to `v` through an edge.

Explanation: The loop runs `n - 1` times because it increments `i` from 0 to `n - 2`. During each iteration, two integers `u` and `v` are read from input and added to the adjacency lists of both `u` and `v`. After all iterations, the variable `i` will be `n - 2`, and the `nodes` dictionary will represent the complete graph structure with all edges added based on the inputs provided.
