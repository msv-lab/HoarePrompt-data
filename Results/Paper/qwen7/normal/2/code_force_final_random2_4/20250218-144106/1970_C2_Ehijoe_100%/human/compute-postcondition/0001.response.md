Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, `edges` is an empty list, and `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n.**

The code initializes an empty list named `edges`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, `edges`, or `start`. The values of `n` and `t` are updated from their initial state to the integer inputs provided, but the code snippet only assigns an empty list to `edges`. Therefore, the output state retains the values of `n` and `start` as integers within their respective ranges and sets `t` to 1, while `edges` is now an empty list.
