Postcondition: **The `nodes` dictionary remains unchanged, the `leaves` deque is populated with all keys from the `nodes` dictionary that have a length of 1 in their associated list, `i` is now `n-2`, `u` and `v` hold the last pair of integers input during the final iteration, `empty` remains `True`, and `t` remains 1; `moves` is the result of the function `func_1(nodes, start)`. Additionally, `moves` is `False`.**
