Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, t, edges, and start. n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, t is an integer such that t = 1, edges is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree, where each tuple (u, v) indicates an undirected edge between nodes u and v, and start is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, representing the initial node where the stone is placed. The function returns a value based on the given conditions.**

This means the function `func_2` takes four parameters: `n`, `t`, `edges`, and `start`. `n` is the number of nodes in the tree, constrained between 2 and \(2 \times 10^5\). `t` is always 1, `edges` is a list of tuples indicating the tree's structure, and `start` is the initial node index where the stone is placed, constrained between 1 and `n`. The function returns a value determined by the input parameters but does not specify the exact nature of the return value from the given information.
