Output State: **`nodes` is a dictionary where the key is associated with a list having exactly one element; `leaves` is a list containing the key.**

Explanation: The code appends the key from the dictionary `nodes` to the list `leaves`. Since the initial state specifies that the key is associated with a list having exactly one element, the key itself is added to the `leaves` list. No other changes are made to the variables or the dictionary `nodes`.
