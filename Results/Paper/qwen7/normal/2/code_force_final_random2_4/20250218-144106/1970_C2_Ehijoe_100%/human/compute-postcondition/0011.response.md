Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` is greater than 1; `u` is an input integer; `v` is an input integer; `nodes[v]` now contains the value `[u]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `u` to the list `nodes[v]`. Initially, `nodes[u]` contained the value `[v]`. After executing the line `nodes[v].append(u)`, the list `nodes[v]` will now contain `[u]` because the append operation adds `u` to the existing list. The values of `i`, `n`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged.
