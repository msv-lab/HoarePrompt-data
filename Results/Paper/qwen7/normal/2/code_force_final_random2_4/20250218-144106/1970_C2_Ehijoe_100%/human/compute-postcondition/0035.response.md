Based on the initial state provided:

- The `nodes` dictionary remains unchanged.
- The `leaves` deque is populated with all keys from the `nodes` dictionary that have a length of 1 in their associated list.
- `i` is now `n-2`.
- `u` and `v` hold the last pair of integers input during the final iteration.
- `empty` remains `True`.
- `t` remains 1.
- `moves` is the result of the function `func_1(nodes, start)` and is truthy.

The print statement is:
```python
print('Ron')
```

This statement will simply print the string 'Ron'.

Output: **Ron**
