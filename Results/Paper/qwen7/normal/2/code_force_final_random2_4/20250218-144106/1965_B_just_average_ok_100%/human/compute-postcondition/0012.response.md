Output State: **`idx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing integers from 2^0 to 2^20, `i` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `idx` was originally `-2`. After executing `idx = i - 1`, since `i` is `1`, `idx` becomes `0`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `nums`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
