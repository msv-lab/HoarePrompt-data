Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not ensure that there is no subsequence with a sum of `k`. Instead, it constructs a sequence that includes `k-2^idx`, `k+1`, and `k+2^idx+1`, which might still allow for a subsequence summing to `k`.

For example, consider the case where `n = 8` and `k = 8`. The program generates the sequence `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 15]`. However, this sequence still allows for a subsequence that sums to `8`, such as `[8]` itself, or `[7, 1]`.

To meet the problem's requirements, the sequence should avoid having any subsequence that sums to `k`. The current approach does not guarantee this.
