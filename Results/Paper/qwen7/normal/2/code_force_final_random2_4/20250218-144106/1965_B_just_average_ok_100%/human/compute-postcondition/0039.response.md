Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given code are `i` and `len(nums)`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(nums)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `len(nums)` is 21
   - `idx` is either -1 (if `nums[i] > k` is true) or remains unchanged (if `nums[i] > k` is false)

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0 and `len(nums)` is 21, the loop condition `i < len(nums)` is satisfied (0 < 21). Therefore, the loop can execute again.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1.
   - The value of `len(nums)` remains unchanged at 21.
   - The value of `idx` can either remain -1 or remain unchanged, but since we are starting a new iteration, we cannot determine its exact value without further information from the loop body. However, we know it will not be affected by the loop condition itself.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `len(nums)` is 21, and `idx` is either -1 or remains unchanged**
