Output State: **`i` is 21, `idx` is 17, `nums` contains elements such that one of them is `k - nums[idx]`, another is `k + 1`, and now includes `k + nums[idx] + 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends `k + nums[idx] + 1` to the list `nums`. Given that `idx` is 17, the new element added to `nums` is `k + nums[17] + 1`. The other conditions about `nums` (one element being `k - nums[idx]` and another being `k + 1`) remain unchanged.
