Output State: **`nums` is the same list, `i` is `i + 2`, `idx` is `i - 1`**

Explanation: The variable `idx` is assigned the value of `i - 1`. Since `i` was previously `i + 2`, the new value of `idx` is `(i + 2) - 1`, which simplifies to `i + 1`. The list `nums` remains unchanged, and the value of `i` is updated to `i + 2`.
