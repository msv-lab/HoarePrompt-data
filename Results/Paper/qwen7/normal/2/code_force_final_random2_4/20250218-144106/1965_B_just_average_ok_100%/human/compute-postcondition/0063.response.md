Output State: **`nums[i]` is greater than `k`; `idx` is `i - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `nums[i]` and `idx`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the code snippet, we assume it breaks out of the context it was provided in. Therefore, the values of `nums[i]` being greater than `k` and `idx` being `i - 1` remain unchanged.
