Output State: **`i` is 21, `idx` is 16, `nums` contains elements such that one of them is `k - nums[idx]`, another is `k + 1`, and now includes `k + nums[idx] + 1`.**

Explanation: The code removes the element `1 << idx` from the list `nums`. Given that `idx` is initially 17, `1 << idx` evaluates to `1 << 17`, which is 131072. After removing 131072 from `nums`, the value of `idx` is automatically decremented by 1 due to the way the operation is performed in the code, making it 16. All other variables and their relationships remain unchanged.
