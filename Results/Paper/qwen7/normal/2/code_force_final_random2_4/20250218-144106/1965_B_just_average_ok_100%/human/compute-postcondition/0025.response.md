Output State: **`idx` is 20, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\) with an additional element `k - nums[20]` and `k + 1` appended to it, and `i` is 22; `nums` now does not contain the element `1 << idx`.**

Explanation: The code removes the element `1 << idx` from the list `nums`. Given that `idx` is 20, `1 << idx` is equivalent to `1 << 20`, which is `1048576`. This value is present in the list `nums` because it is one of the integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\). After removing this element, the list `nums` no longer contains `1048576`. All other variables remain unchanged.
