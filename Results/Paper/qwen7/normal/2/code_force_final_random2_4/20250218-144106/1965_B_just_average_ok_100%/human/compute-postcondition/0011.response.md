Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(len(nums))`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `len(nums)`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `idx` is -2
   - `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `k` is an input integer
   - `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)
   - `i` is 0
   - We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

3. **Determine the next state for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(nums)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - Therefore, the next value of `i` would be 1.
   - Since `nums` is a list with a length of 21 (from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)), `i` can indeed be incremented to 1 without breaking the loop condition.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be updated to 1.
   - All other variables (`idx`, `t`, `n`, `k`, and `nums`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`idx` is -2, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing integers from 2^0 to 2^20, `i` is 1**
