Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `len(nums)`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as `i < len(nums)`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `len(nums)` is 21
   - `idx` is either -1 (if `nums[i] > k` is true) or remains unchanged (if `nums[i] > k` is false)

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, the loop will continue if `i < len(nums)`.
   - After the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1.
   - `len(nums)` remains unchanged at 21.
   - `idx` will remain in its current state unless `nums[1] > k` is true, but since we don't know the value of `k` or `nums[1]`, we cannot determine the exact value of `idx` without additional information. However, we know it will either be -1 or unchanged.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `i` will be 1.
- `len(nums)` will remain 21.
- `idx` will either be -1 or unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `i` is 1, `len(nums)` is 21, and `idx` is either -1 (if `nums[1] > k` is true) or remains unchanged (if `nums[1] > k` is false)**.
