Output State: **`idx` is -1, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `nums` is a list containing the first 21 powers of 2 starting from 2^0.**

The code simply assigns `-1` to the variable `idx`. The values of `n`, `k`, and the list `nums` remain unchanged from their initial states.
