Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `nums`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is within the range of `len(nums)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `idx` is 0
   - `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `k` is an input integer
   - `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)
   - `i` is 1
   - If `nums[i]` is greater than `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1, after the first iteration, `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(nums)`.
   - We need to ensure that `i` is set to 2 for the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `idx` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `k` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `nums` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` is incremented to 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`idx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), `i` is 2**
