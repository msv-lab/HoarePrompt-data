Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state provides us with the following information:
   - `i` is 20.
   - `len(nums)` is 23, meaning the list `nums` has 23 elements.
   - `idx` is either -1 or a value between 0 and 19.
   - `nums[-1]` is `k + nums[idx] + 1`.

2. The `print(len(nums))` statement will print the length of the list `nums`.

3. According to the initial state, the length of `nums` is explicitly given as 23.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **23**
