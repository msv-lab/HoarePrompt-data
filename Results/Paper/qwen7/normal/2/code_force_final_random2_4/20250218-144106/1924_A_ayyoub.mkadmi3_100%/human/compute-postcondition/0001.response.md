Output State: **`s1` is an empty string, `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that `1 <= n <= 26` and `1 <= k <= 26`, and `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 1000`; `s2` is an empty string.**

The code `s2 = ''` initializes `s2` to an empty string. Since `s1`, `s`, `n`, `k`, and `m` were not affected by this line of code, their states remain unchanged.
