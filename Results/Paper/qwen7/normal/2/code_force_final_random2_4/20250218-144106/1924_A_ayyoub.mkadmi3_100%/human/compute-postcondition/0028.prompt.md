Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s1` is an empty string, `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that `1 <= n <= 26` and `1 <= k <= 26`, and `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 1000`; `s2` is an empty string; `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i in alphabet:
        if len(alphabet) != 1:
            alphabet.remove(i)
        else:
            s2 += i
            alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
        s1 += i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is added to `s1` if it is in the alphabet, making `s1` equal to the first character of `s`. `s` remains a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. If the length of the alphabet is not 1, then `i` is not in the alphabet and the length of the alphabet is `k-1`; otherwise, `s2` is a string containing the character `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is the next character in `s`, `s1` contains characters from `s` that are in the `alphabet` plus the character `i`, `s` remains a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k-1` lowercase English alphabets if `len(alphabet) != 1`, otherwise `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `s2` is `s2` plus the character `i` if `len(alphabet) == 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is the next character in `s`, `s1` contains characters from `s` that are in the `alphabet` plus the character `i` added to `s1`, `s` remains a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k-1` or `k` lowercase English alphabets depending on the condition, and `s2` is `s2` plus the character `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
