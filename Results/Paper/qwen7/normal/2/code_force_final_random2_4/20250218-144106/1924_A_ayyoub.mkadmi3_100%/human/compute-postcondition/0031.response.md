Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: a string `s`, an integer `k`, and an integer `n`. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the length of a substring of `s` starting from index `r * k` (where `r * k` is less than or equal to the length of `s`) is greater than or equal to `n * k`, and also returns the substring itself and the original string `s2` as it is.**
