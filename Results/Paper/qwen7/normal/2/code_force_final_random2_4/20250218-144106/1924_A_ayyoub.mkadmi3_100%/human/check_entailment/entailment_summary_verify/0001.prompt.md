You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

- Program:
t = int(input())
OUT = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    (b, s1, s2) = func_1(s, k, n)
    if not b:
        OUT.append('No')
        i = 97
        while i <= k + 97:
            if chr(i) not in s1:
                break
            i += 1
        be9i = chr(i) * (n - len(s2))
        OUT.append(s2 + be9i)
    else:
        OUT.append('Yes')
for i in OUT:
    print(i)

def func_1(s, k, n):
    s1 = ''
    s2 = ''
    alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
    for i in s:
        if i in alphabet:
            if len(alphabet) != 1:
                alphabet.remove(i)
            else:
                s2 += i
                alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
            s1 += i
    r = len(s1) // k
    return (len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a string `s`, an integer `k`, and an integer `n`. It filters `s` to keep only characters from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, constructs two new strings `s1` and `s2` based on this filter, and calculates a value `r`. Finally, it returns a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end, and the original string `s2` unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function processes the string `s` to check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - It initializes an empty string `s1` and `s2`.
   - It creates a set `alphabet` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and checks if each character is in the `alphabet`:
     - If the character is in `alphabet`, it removes the character from `alphabet` if `alphabet` has more than one character.
     - Otherwise, it appends the character to `s2` and resets `alphabet` to the full set of the first `k` alphabets.
     - It appends the character to `s1`.
   - It calculates the remainder `r` of the length of `s1` divided by `k`.
   - It returns a tuple `(len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2)`:
     - The first element checks if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`.
     - The second element is a substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k`.
     - The third element is `s2`.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The main loop processes each test case.
   - It calls `func_1` and checks the result.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, it appends 'No' to `OUT` and constructs a string `s2 + be9i` where `be9i` is a string of length `n - len(s2)` using the first `k` alphabets that are not in `s1`.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it appends 'Yes' to `OUT`.

4. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints each element in `OUT`.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Subsequence Check:**
   - The logic in `func_1` does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`. Instead, it checks if a specific sequence of characters exists in `s` and ignores the order and frequency of characters.
   
2. **Construction of Non-Subsequence String:**
   - The construction of the non-subsequence string `s2 + be9i` assumes that `s1` contains all necessary characters but does not ensure that the constructed string is indeed a valid non-subsequence of `s`.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: **False**
