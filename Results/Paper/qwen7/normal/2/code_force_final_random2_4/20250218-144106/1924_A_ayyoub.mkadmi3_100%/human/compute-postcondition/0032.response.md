Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `s`, an integer `k`, and an integer `n`. It filters `s` to keep only characters from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, constructs two new strings `s1` and `s2` based on this filter, and calculates a value `r`. Finally, it returns a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end, and the original string `s2` unchanged.**
