Output State: **The program returns a new list where each element is one less than the corresponding element in the original list 'a'**

This means that for every integer in the list `a`, the program subtracts 1 from it and returns the resulting list. Since the initial state specifies that `a` is a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), the returned list will contain integers ranging from 0 to 99.
