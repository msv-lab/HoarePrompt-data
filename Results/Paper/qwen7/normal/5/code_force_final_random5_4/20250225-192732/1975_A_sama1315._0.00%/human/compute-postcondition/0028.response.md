Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `index` is defined as `9 + 3*n`.
   - `t` is 0.
   - `results` is a list with three additional elements, but their values are not explicitly given.
   - `arr` is a list of integers obtained by converting elements from `data` using `map(int, data[index - n:index])`.
   - `n` is the integer value of `data[index - n]`.
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`.

2. **Code Snippet Analysis:**
   - The code snippet is `print('\n'.join(results))`.

Given the initial state, let's determine the values of the relevant variables:

- `index = 9 + 3*n`. Since `n` is the integer value of `data[index - n]`, and `index` itself depends on `n`, we need to find a consistent value for `n` to proceed. However, without the exact value of `data`, we cannot determine `n` precisely. But we know `results` is a list with three additional elements, and we need to join these elements with newline characters and print them.

Since the exact values of `results` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the structure of the list.

Output: **result\narr\n[elements of arr]** (where `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`, and `arr` is the list of integers obtained from `data[index - n:index]`).
