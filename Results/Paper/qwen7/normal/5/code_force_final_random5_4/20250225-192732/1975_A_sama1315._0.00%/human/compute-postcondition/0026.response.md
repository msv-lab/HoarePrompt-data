Output State: **`index` is 9 + n + 2 * n, `t` is greater than 0, `results` is a list with three additional elements which are `result`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by converting elements from `data` using `map(int, data[index - n:index])`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index - n]`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`**.

Explanation: The line `results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. Initially, `results` had two additional elements (`result` and `arr`). After appending `result`, `results` now has three additional elements. All other variables remain unchanged.
