Output State: **`index` is 1, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string received from stdin.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `t` by converting `data[index]` to an integer, where `index` is initially 0. After executing `t = int(data[index])`, `index` is incremented by 1 (though not explicitly shown in the code, this is the typical behavior when accessing elements in a list by index), and `t` is now an integer equal to `int(data[0])`. The original list `data` and its state remain unchanged except for the fact that `index` has moved to the next element.
