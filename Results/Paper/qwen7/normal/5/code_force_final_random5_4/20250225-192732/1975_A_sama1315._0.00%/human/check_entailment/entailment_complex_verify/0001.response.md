### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to check if an array can be made non-decreasing by splitting it into two parts and swapping them.
   - `func_1` should determine if the array is already non-decreasing.
   - `func_2` reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function checks if the array is already non-decreasing using `all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`.
     - If true, it returns 'Yes'.
     - Otherwise, it uses `any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))` to check if there is at least one pair where the current element is greater than the next element.
       - If such a pair exists, it returns 'No'.
       - If no such pair exists, it implicitly returns 'Yes'.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - It reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The logic seems correct for reading and processing multiple test cases.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The core logic in `func_1` is correct. It correctly identifies if an array is non-decreasing or if there is exactly one pair where the current element is greater than the next element.
   - However, the function `func_1` does not actually check if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts. Instead, it only checks if the array is already non-decreasing or if there is exactly one pair where the current element is greater than the next element. This does not guarantee that the array can be made non-decreasing by the described operation.

5. **Example Analysis:**
   - Consider the array `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5]`. According to the problem statement, we can split it into `[3, 1]` and `[4, 1, 5]` and swap them to get `[4, 1, 5, 3, 1]`, which is not non-decreasing.
   - However, `func_1` would return 'No' because there is more than one pair where the current element is greater than the next element (`3 > 1` and `4 > 1`).

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts. It only checks if the array is already non-decreasing or if there is exactly one pair where the current element is greater than the next element.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
