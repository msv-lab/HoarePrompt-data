### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code step-by-step.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by repeatedly splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix and swapping them. The key point is that the array can be split and swapped in any way, not just adjacent elements.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is sorted, it returns `'Yes'`.
   - Otherwise, it checks if there is any pair of consecutive elements where the first is greater than the second. If such a pair exists, it returns `'No'`.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It constructs the array `arr` from the input data and passes it to `func_1`.

#### Annotations and State Analysis:
- **Initial State:** `arr` is a list of integers where the length is between 2 and 50, and each element is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^6\).
- **After `func_1` call:** If the array is already sorted, it returns `'Yes'`. Otherwise, it checks for any pair of consecutive elements where the first is greater than the second and returns `'No'` if found, otherwise `'Yes'`.

#### Test Case Analysis:
- **Test Case 1:** `[1, 3, 2]`
  - `func_1` will return `'No'` because the array is not sorted.
  - However, this array can be sorted by the described operation:
    - Split into `[1]` and `[3, 2]`, swap to get `[3, 2, 1]`.
    - Split `[3, 2]` into `[3]` and `[2]`, swap to get `[2, 3, 1]`.
    - Split `[2, 3]` into `[2]` and `[3]`, swap to get `[2, 3, 1]`, which is sorted.
  - Therefore, the function should return `'Yes'`.

- **Test Case 2:** `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`
  - `func_1` will return `'No'` because the array is not sorted.
  - However, this array can be sorted by the described operation:
    - Split into `[7]` and `[9, 2, 2, 3]`, swap to get `[9, 2, 2, 3, 7]`.
    - Split `[9, 2, 2, 3]` into `[9]` and `[2, 2, 3]`, swap to get `[2, 2, 3, 9]`.
    - Split `[2, 2, 3]` into `[2]` and `[2, 3]`, swap to get `[2, 2, 3]`.
    - Split `[2, 2, 3]` into `[2]` and `[2, 3]`, swap to get `[2, 2, 3]`, which is sorted.
  - Therefore, the function should return `'Yes'`.

- **Test Case 3:** `[1, 2, 3]`
  - The array is already sorted, so `func_1` will return `'Yes'`.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is incorrect because `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted and does not consider the possibility of rearranging the array through the described operation. The provided code fails to handle cases where the array can be sorted through the described operation.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
