### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to check if an array can be made non-decreasing by splitting it into two parts and swapping them.
   - `func_1` should determine if the array is already non-decreasing.
   - `func_2` reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function checks if the array is already non-decreasing using `all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`.
     - If true, it returns 'Yes'.
     - Otherwise, it uses `any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))` to check if there is at least one pair where the current element is greater than the next element.
       - If such a pair exists, it returns 'No'.
       - If no such pair exists, it implicitly returns 'Yes'.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - It reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The logic seems correct for reading and processing multiple test cases.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The core logic in `func_1` is correct. It correctly identifies if an array is non-decreasing or if there is exactly one pair where the current element is greater than the next element.
   - However, there is a flaw in the implementation of `func_1`. The function does not account for the possibility of making the array non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts. The current implementation only checks if the array is already non-decreasing or has exactly one inversion. This is not sufficient to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts.

### Example to Illustrate the Flaw:
Consider the array `[1, 3, 2]`. According to `func_1`, this array would return 'No' because there is an inversion (`3 > 2`). However, we can split the array into `[1]` and `[3, 2]`, swap them, and get `[3, 2, 1]`, which is not non-decreasing. But we can further split `[3, 2]` into `[3]` and `[2]`, swap them, and get `[2, 3, 1]`, which is still not non-decreasing. Finally, we can split `[2, 3, 1]` into `[2, 3]` and `[1]`, swap them, and get `[1, 2, 3]`, which is non-decreasing.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if an array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts. The current implementation only checks for non-decreasing order and single inversions, which is insufficient.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
