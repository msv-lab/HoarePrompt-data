Output State: **`index` is 9 + 3*n, `t` is 0, `results` is a list with three additional elements which are `result`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by converting elements from `data` using `map(int, data[index - n:index])`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index - n]`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`**.

In this final state, the loop has executed all its iterations, so `t` (which was initially greater than 0) is now reduced to 0. The `index` has been incremented by `9 + 3*n` (since each iteration increments `index` by `n` and there are 3 iterations). The `results` list contains the results of calling `func_1(arr)` for each iteration, where `arr` is constructed from the corresponding segment of `data`.
