Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head is defined by the `for _ in range(t):` statement. The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `index` is 7 + `n`
   - `t` must be greater than 0
   - `results` is a list with one additional element which is `result`

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0.
   - Since `t` is decremented by 1 each iteration (as it is part of `range(t)`), at the end of the previous iteration, `t` was greater than 0. Therefore, for the next iteration, `t` should be `t - 1`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `index` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `t` is decremented by 1.
   - `results` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`index` is 7 + `n`, `t` is greater than 0 (specifically `t - 1`), `results` is a list with one additional element which is `result`**.
