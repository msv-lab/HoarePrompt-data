Output State: **`index` is 8 + `n` + `n`, `t` is greater than 0, `results` is a list with one additional element which is `result`, `n` is an integer value from `data[index-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by converting elements from `data` using `map(int, data[index:index + n]), `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `result` to the return value of the function `func_1(arr)`. The function `func_1` is called with `arr` as its argument, which is a list of integers obtained by converting elements from `data` within the range `data[index:index + n]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
