Output State: **`index` is 8 + `n`, `t` is greater than 0, `results` is a list with one additional element which is `result`, `n` is an integer value from `data[index-1]`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by converting elements from `data` using `map(int, data[index:index + n])`**.

Explanation: The code creates a list `arr` by mapping the `int` function over a slice of the `data` list starting from `index` and ending at `index + n`. The values of `index`, `t`, `results`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new variable `arr` is created and populated with integer values from the specified slice of `data`.
