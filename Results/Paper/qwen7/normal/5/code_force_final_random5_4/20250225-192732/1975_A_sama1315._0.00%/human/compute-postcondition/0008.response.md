Output State: **`index` is 4, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer value from `data[2]`**

Explanation: The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. Initially, `index` is 3, so after executing the code, `index` becomes 4. The other variables (`t`, `results`, and `n`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
