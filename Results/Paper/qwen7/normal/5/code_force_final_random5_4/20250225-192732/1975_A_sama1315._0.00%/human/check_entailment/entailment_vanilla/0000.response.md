### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to check if an array can be made non-decreasing by splitting it into two parts and swapping them.
   - `func_1` should determine if the array is already non-decreasing.
   - `func_2` reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function checks if the array is already non-decreasing using `all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`.
     - If true, it returns 'Yes'.
     - Otherwise, it uses `any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))` to check if there is at least one pair where the current element is greater than the next element.
       - If such a pair exists, it returns 'No'.
       - If no such pair exists, it implicitly returns 'Yes'.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - It reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The logic seems correct for reading and processing multiple test cases.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The core logic in `func_1` is correct. It correctly identifies if an array is non-decreasing or if there is exactly one pair where the current element is greater than the next element.
   - `func_2` correctly handles reading input and calling `func_1` for each test case.

Given this analysis, the functions appear to be correct based on the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if an array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts.
