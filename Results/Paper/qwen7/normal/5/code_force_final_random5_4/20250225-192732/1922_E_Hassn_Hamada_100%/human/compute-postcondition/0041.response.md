Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is the maximum value in the sequence.
- `size` is `i + 9`.
- `value` is `(1 << (i + 7)) - (1 << i)`.
- `number` must be at least \((1 << i) \cdot 7\).
- `size_overlap` is a tuple containing `size` and `i`.

### Loop Head
The loop head is:
```python
for i in range(max(sequence, default=0), -1, -1):
```

### Analysis
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts from `max(sequence, default=0)` and decrements `i` until it reaches `-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the maximum value in the sequence.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be greater than `-1`.

2. **Other Variables:**
   - `size`, `value`, `number`, and `size_overlap` are not directly controlled by the loop itself but are derived from `i` and other conditions. These variables do not change within the loop unless explicitly modified inside the loop body, which is not provided here.

### Conclusion
Since the loop continues as long as `i` is greater than `-1`, the only variable that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `i`.

### New State
- `i` must be greater than `-1` (i.e., `i` should be decremented by 1 from its previous value).

Given that `i` was the maximum value in the sequence at the end of the previous iteration, decrementing `i` by 1 gives us the new value of `i`.

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is the maximum value in the sequence minus 1, `size` is `i + 9`, `value` is `(1 << (i + 7)) - (1 << i)`, `number` must be at least \((1 << i) \cdot 7\), and `size_overlap` is a tuple containing `size` and `i`.**

In a more concise form:
State: **`i` is the maximum value in the sequence - 1, `size` is `i + 9`, `value` is `(1 << (i + 7)) - (1 << i)`, `number` must be at least \((1 << i) \cdot 7\), and `size_overlap` is a tuple containing `size` and `i`.**
