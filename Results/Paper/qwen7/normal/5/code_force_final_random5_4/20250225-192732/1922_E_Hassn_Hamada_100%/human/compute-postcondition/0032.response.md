Output State: **`i` is the maximum value in the sequence, `size` is `i + 7`, `value` is \((1 << (i + 5)) - (1 << i)\), `number` must be at least \((1 << i) \cdot 7\)**

Explanation: The line `size += 1` increments the value of `size` by 1. Initially, `size` was `i + 6`, so after the increment, `size` becomes `i + 7`. The values of `i`, `value`, and `number` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.
