Output State: `i` is the maximum value in the sequence - 1; `size` is `i + 5`; `value` is \((1 << (i + 4)) - (1 << i)\); `number` must be at least \(31 \cdot (1 << i)\); `size_overlap` is a tuple containing `i + 1` and `i`.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` remains the same as it was initially. The `size` increases by 1 with each iteration, so after 4 iterations (including the initial state given), `size` becomes `i + 4 + 1 = i + 5`. The `value` doubles with each iteration, starting from \((1 << (i + 1)) - (1 << i)\), so after 4 iterations, it becomes \((1 << (i + 4)) - (1 << i)\). The condition `number` must be at least \((1 << i) \cdot 7\) changes to \((1 << i) \cdot 15\) after 2 iterations and further to \((1 << i) \cdot 31\) after 4 iterations. The `size_overlap` remains a tuple containing `i + 1` and `i` throughout the iterations.
