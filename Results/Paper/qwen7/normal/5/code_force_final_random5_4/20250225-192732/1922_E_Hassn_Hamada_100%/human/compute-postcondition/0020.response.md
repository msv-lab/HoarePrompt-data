Output State: **`i` is the maximum value in the sequence, `size` is `i + 4`, `value` is `(1 << (i + 4)) - (1 << i)`, and `size_overlap` is `size, i`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `size`, `value`, and `size_overlap`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged, and we simply note that we break out of the loop or conditional statement.
