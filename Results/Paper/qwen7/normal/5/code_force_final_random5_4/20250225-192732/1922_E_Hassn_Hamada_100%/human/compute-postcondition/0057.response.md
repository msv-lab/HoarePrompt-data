Postcondition: `i` is the maximum value in the sequence - 1; `size` is `i + 5`; `value` is \((1 << (i + 4)) - (1 << i)\); `number` must be at least \(31 \cdot (1 << i)\); `size_overlap` is a tuple containing `i + 5` and `i`. If the `value` is less than or equal to `number`, then `size` remains `i + 5`, `value` remains \((1 << (i + 4)) - (1 << i)\), and `number` remains at least \(31 \cdot (1 << i)\).
