Output State: `i` is the maximum value in the sequence, `size` is `i + 9`, `value` is `(1 << (i + 7)) - (1 << i)`, `number` must be at least \((1 << i) \cdot 7\).

Explanation: After each iteration of the loop, `size` increases by 2 and `value` is updated to `(1 << (size - 1)) - (1 << i)`. The loop continues as long as \((1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i) \leq number\). Given that the loop executes 3 times, we can deduce that it will execute until `size` reaches `i + 8` (since it starts from `i + 3` and increments by 2 each time). Therefore, after all iterations, `size` will be `i + 9`, and `value` will be \((1 << (i + 7)) - (1 << i)\). The condition on `number` remains the same, as it is not modified within the loop.
