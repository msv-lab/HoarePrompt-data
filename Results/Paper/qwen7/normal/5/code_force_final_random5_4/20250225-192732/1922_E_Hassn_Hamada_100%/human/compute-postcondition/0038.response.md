Output State: **`i` is the maximum value in the sequence, `size` is `i + 9`, `value` is `(1 << (i + 7)) - (1 << i)`, `number` must be at least \((1 << i) \cdot 7\), and `size_overlap` is a tuple containing `size` and `i`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables; it only exits the current loop or conditional block. Since no variables are reassigned or modified within the given code snippet, the values of `i`, `size`, `value`, `number`, and `size_overlap` remain unchanged. The `break` statement indicates that we exit the most internal loop or if statement we were inside.
