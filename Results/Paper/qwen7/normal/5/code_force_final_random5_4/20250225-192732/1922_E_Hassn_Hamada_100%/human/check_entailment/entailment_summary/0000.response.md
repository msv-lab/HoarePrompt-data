Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to generate an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The provided solution attempts to solve this by recursively constructing sequences using binary representation concepts.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of numbers based on the input `number`.
   - It uses a loop to determine the appropriate size and value for the current level of recursion.
   - The function appends values to the `sequence` list and recursively calls itself with updated parameters until `number` becomes 0.

3. **Recursive Construction**:
   - The recursive approach uses binary representation to construct the sequence. For each level, it determines the next value to append based on the binary representation of the remaining `number`.
   - This ensures that the generated sequence will have the desired number of increasing subsequences.

4. **Output Generation**:
   - After the recursive construction, the length of the generated sequence is printed.
   - The sequence itself is printed on the next line.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the base case where `number` is 0 by returning `(0, 0)`.
   - The function correctly constructs the sequence for various values of `X` within the specified range.

6. **Validation**:
   - The provided examples in the execution summary demonstrate that the function works correctly for different values of `X`.
   - The generated sequences match the expected number of increasing subsequences.

Given the analysis, the provided program appears to correctly implement the logic to generate an array with the desired number of increasing subsequences.

Correctness: **True**
