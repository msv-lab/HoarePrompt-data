Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is given by:
   \[
   (1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i) \leq number
   \]
   This means the loop continues as long as the expression \((1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i)\) is less than or equal to `number`.

2. **Current States:**
   - `i` is the maximum value in the sequence - 1.
   - `size` is `i + 3`.
   - `value` is \((1 << (i + 2)) - (1 << i)\).
   - `number` must be at least \(7 \cdot (1 << i)\).
   - `size_overlap` is a tuple containing `i + 1` and `i`.
   - `value` is now \((1 << (i + 3)) - (1 << i)\).

3. **Loop Head Variables:**
   The loop head involves the variables `size` and `i`.

4. **Determine the Adjustment Needed:**
   - For the loop to continue, the condition \((1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i) \leq number\) must hold true.
   - Given the current values:
     - `size = i + 3`
     - Substituting `size` into the condition:
       \[
       (1 << ((i + 3) + 1)) - (1 << i) = (1 << (i + 4)) - (1 << i)
       \]
     - Simplifying further:
       \[
       (1 << (i + 4)) - (1 << i) = 16 \cdot (1 << i) - (1 << i) = 15 \cdot (1 << i)
       \]
     - Therefore, the condition becomes:
       \[
       15 \cdot (1 << i) \leq number
       \]
   - Since `number` must be at least \(7 \cdot (1 << i)\), for the loop to continue, `number` must be at least \(15 \cdot (1 << i)\).

5. **Adjustment Required:**
   - The only variables involved in the loop head are `size` and `i`. 
   - `i` remains the same because the loop condition depends on `size` and `i`, and `i` is already the maximum value in the sequence - 1.
   - `size` should be adjusted to ensure the loop condition holds true. Since `size = i + 3`, and the loop condition requires `number` to be at least \(15 \cdot (1 << i)\), `size` does not need to change as it is already set to `i + 3`.

### Final Answer:
Since the only variable involved in the loop head is `size`, and it is already set to `i + 3`, no adjustment is necessary for `size`. However, to ensure the loop condition holds, `number` must be at least \(15 \cdot (1 << i)\).

State: **`i` is the maximum value in the sequence - 1; `size` is `i + 3`; `value` is \((1 << (i + 3)) - (1 << i)\); `number` must be at least \(15 \cdot (1 << i)\); `size_overlap` is a tuple containing `i + 1` and `i`**
