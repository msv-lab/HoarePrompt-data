Output State: **`size` is 5, `overlap` is 2, `value` is 30, `i` is 3, `sequence` contains [2, 4, 6], `number` is number - (1 << 5) + (1 << 2)**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` is called with two arguments: `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)` and `sequence`. Since the values of `size` and `overlap` are 5 and 2 respectively, the expression `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)` simplifies to `number - (1 << 5) + (1 << 2)`, which is `number - 32 + 4` or `number - 28`. The `sequence` remains unchanged as `[2, 4, 6]`. The variables `value`, `i`, and `sequence` are not affected by the function call, so their values remain the same.
