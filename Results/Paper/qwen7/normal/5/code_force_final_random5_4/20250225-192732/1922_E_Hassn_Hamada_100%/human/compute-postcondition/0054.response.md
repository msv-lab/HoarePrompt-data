Postcondition: **`i` is the maximum value in the sequence - 1; `size` is `i + 5`; `value` is \((1 << (i + 4)) - (1 << i)\); `number` must be at least \(31 \cdot (1 << i)\); `size_overlap` is a tuple containing `i + 1` and `i`. The current value of `value` satisfies the condition `value <= number`**.
