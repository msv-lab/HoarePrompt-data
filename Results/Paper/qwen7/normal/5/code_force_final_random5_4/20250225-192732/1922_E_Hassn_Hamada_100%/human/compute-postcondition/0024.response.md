Output State: **`i` is the maximum value in the sequence minus 1; `size` is `i + 2`; `value` is `(1 << (i + 2)) - (1 << i)`**

Explanation: Initially, `size` is defined as `i + 4` and `value` is defined as `(1 << (i + 4)) - (1 << i)`. After executing the code snippet, `size` and `value` are updated to `i + 1` and `(1 << (i + 1)) - (1 << i)` respectively. The variable `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, the new value of `size` is `i + 2` and the new value of `value` is `(1 << (i + 2)) - (1 << i)`.
