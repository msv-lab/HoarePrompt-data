Output State: **`i` must be set such that (1 << (i + 3)) - (1 << i) <= number and `size` is `i + 3`, `value` is (1 << size) - (1 << i)**

Explanation: The code calculates `value` as `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`. Given that `size` is `i + 3`, `value` becomes `(1 << (i + 3)) - (1 << i)`, which is the same condition that `i` must satisfy. Therefore, the updated state includes the new variable `value` with its calculated value, while the conditions for `i` and `size` remain unchanged.
