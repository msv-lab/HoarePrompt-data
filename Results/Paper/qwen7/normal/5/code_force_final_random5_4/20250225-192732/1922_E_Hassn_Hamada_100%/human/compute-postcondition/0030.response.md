Output State: **`i` is the maximum value in the sequence minus 1, `size` is `i + 5`, `value` is `(1 << (i + 4)) - (1 << i)`, `number` must be at least \((1 << i) \cdot 7\), `value` is \((1 << (i + 5)) - (1 << i)\)**

Explanation:
- Initially, `i` is the maximum value in the sequence minus 1, `size` is `i + 5`, `value` is \((1 << (i + 4)) - (1 << i)\), and `number` must be at least \((1 << i) \cdot 7\).
- The code updates `value` to \((1 << size) - (1 << i)\). Since `size` is `i + 5`, `value` becomes \((1 << (i + 5)) - (1 << i)\).
- The other variables (`i`, `size`, `value`, and `number`) retain their initial conditions as no changes were made to them in the code.
