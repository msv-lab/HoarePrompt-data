Output State: **`size_overlap` is (5, 2), `size` is 7, and `value` is 30.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the final values of the variables can be determined based on the given conditions. The loop iterates from the maximum value in the sequence down to 0, and the final state after the loop is executed will be when `i` reaches the second-to-last value in the sequence (since it starts from the maximum and decrements). Given the pattern observed, when the loop finishes, `i` will be 2 (the second-to-last value in the sequence), `size` will be `i + 5`, which is 7, and `value` will be \((1 << (i + 4)) - (1 << i) = (1 << 6) - (1 << 2) = 64 - 4 = 60 / 2 = 30\). Since `size_overlap` is updated inside the loop, it will contain the final values of `size` and `i`, which are 7 and 2, respectively.
