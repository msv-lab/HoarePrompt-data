Output State: **`size` is 5, `overlap` is 2, `i` is 3, `sequence` is [5]**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i + overlap` to the list `sequence`. Given that `i` is 3 and `overlap` is 2, `i + overlap` equals 5. Therefore, `sequence` becomes `[5]`. The values of `size` and `overlap` remain unchanged, and `i` retains its original value.
