Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop condition is given by:
   \[
   (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) \leq number
   \]
   The variables involved in this condition are `size` and `i`.

2. **Current States Before the Loop:**
   - `i` is the maximum value in the sequence minus 1.
   - `size` is `i + 2`.
   - `value` is `(1 << (i + 2)) - (1 << i)`.

3. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   We need to ensure that the expression \((1 << size + 1) - (1 << i)\) is less than or equal to `number` for the loop to execute the first time.

4. **Substitute the Current Values:**
   - Given `i` is the maximum value in the sequence minus 1.
   - Given `size` is `i + 2`.

5. **Calculate the Expression:**
   Substitute `size` into the expression:
   \[
   (1 << (i + 2 + 1)) - (1 << i) = (1 << (i + 3)) - (1 << i)
   \]

6. **Simplify the Expression:**
   Simplify the expression:
   \[
   (1 << (i + 3)) - (1 << i) = (1 << i) \cdot 2^3 - (1 << i) = (1 << i) \cdot (8 - 1) = (1 << i) \cdot 7
   \]

7. **Ensure the Condition is Met:**
   For the loop to execute the first time, the condition \((1 << i) \cdot 7 \leq number\) must hold true.

8. **Adjust the State:**
   Since `i` is fixed based on the sequence, we need to ensure that `number` is at least \((1 << i) \cdot 7\).

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that `number` is at least \((1 << i) \cdot 7\).

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is the maximum value in the sequence minus 1; `size` is `i + 2`; `value` is `(1 << (i + 2)) - (1 << i)`; `number` must be at least \((1 << i) \cdot 7\)**
