Output State: **`size_overlap` is (0, 0)**

Explanation: The code initializes `size_overlap` to a tuple `(0, 0)`. This means both elements of the tuple `size_overlap` are set to 0. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the only change is the initialization of `size_overlap`.
