Output State: **`size` is 5, `overlap` is 2, `value` is 30, `i` is 1, `sequence` contains [2]**.

The code appends the value of `i + overlap` (which is `0 + 2`) to the `sequence` list. Since `i` was initially 0, after the operation `i` is incremented by 1 (though not explicitly shown in the code, it's implied by the sequence appending operation). The `sequence` list now contains the value `[2]`. All other variables retain their initial values.
