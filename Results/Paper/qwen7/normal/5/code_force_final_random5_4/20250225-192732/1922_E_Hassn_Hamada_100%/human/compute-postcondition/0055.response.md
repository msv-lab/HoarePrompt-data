Output State: **`i` is the maximum value in the sequence - 1; `size` is `i + 5`; `value` is \((1 << (i + 4)) - (1 << i)\); `number` must be at least \(31 \cdot (1 << i)\); `size_overlap` is a tuple containing `i + 5` and `i`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `size_overlap` to be a tuple containing `size` and `i`. The other variables (`i`, `size`, `value`, `number`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new tuple value for `size_overlap`.
