Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `qi` is 2, `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, `m` is the third integer input, `ans` is `m // a + m // b + 2`, `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, `m` is the third integer input.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. These values replace the placeholders for `a`, `b`, and `m` in the initial state. The value of `ans` remains unchanged as the calculation for `ans` is done after these assignments. The variable `t` and `qi` remain unaffected.
