Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `qi` is 1, `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, `m` is the third integer input, `ans` is `m // a + m // b + 2`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` to `m // a + m // b + 2`. The values of `t`, `qi`, `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes these unchanged variables along with the updated value of `ans`.
