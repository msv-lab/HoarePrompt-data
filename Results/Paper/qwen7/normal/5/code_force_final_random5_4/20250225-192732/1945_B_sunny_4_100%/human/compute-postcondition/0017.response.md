Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(m\). For each test case, it calculates the value of \(ans\) as \(m // a + m // b + 2\) and prints the result. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the calculated \(ans\) values for each case.**
