Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `qi` is 0, `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, `m` is the third integer input, `ans` is `m // a + m // b + 2`**.

This means that `ans` is calculated as the integer division of `m` by `a`, plus the integer division of `m` by `b`, plus 2. All other variables retain their initial states.
