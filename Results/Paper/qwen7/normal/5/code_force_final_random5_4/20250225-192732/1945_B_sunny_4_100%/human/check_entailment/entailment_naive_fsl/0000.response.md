Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in its calculation of the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously. According to the problem description, the formula `A + B` should be used to calculate the number of fireworks from each installation that are visible at the same time, but the program incorrectly calculates `A + B + 2`.

The correct approach is to calculate the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period `m`. Specifically, the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within `m` minutes is `m // a + 1`, and similarly for the second installation, which is `m // b + 1`. However, the program incorrectly adds 2 to the sum of these values.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:
- Input: `1 1 1000000000000000000`
- Expected Output: `2000000000000000002`
- Program Output: `2000000000000000000`

The program's output is incorrect because it adds 2 to the sum, whereas the correct calculation should be:
\[ \text{ans} = \left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor + 1 + \left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor + 1 - \left\lfloor \frac{m}{\text{lcm}(a, b)} \right\rfloor \]

Since the program does not handle the least common multiple (lcm) correctly and adds an extra 2, it fails to provide the accurate result for many cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
