### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate an array \(a\) of length \(n\) such that exactly \(k\) out of the \(n\) cyclic shifts of the array are sorted.
   - If no such array exists, we should output `-1`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The function `func()` processes input from standard input.
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(k\) from the input.
   - It checks if \(k \geq 2\):
     - If \(k = n\), it prints an array where each element is equal to \(k\).
     - Otherwise, it prints `-1`.
   - If \(k < 2\), it prints an array where each element is its index plus one.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - **Case \(k = n\):**
     - If \(k = n\), the array must be such that every cyclic shift is sorted. This can only happen if all elements in the array are the same. Hence, printing an array where each element is \(k\) is correct.
   - **Case \(k < n\):**
     - The current implementation always prints `-1`, which is incorrect. However, we can construct a valid array for some cases where \(k < n\). For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`. In this array, only the first cyclic shift is sorted. By reversing the array, we get `[n, n-1, n-2, ..., 1]`, where again only the first cyclic shift is sorted. We can interleave these two arrays to achieve exactly \(k\) sorted cyclic shifts. For instance, if \(n = 4\) and \(k = 2\), we can use the array `[1, 4, 2, 3]`. Its cyclic shifts are:
       - `[1, 4, 2, 3]` (not sorted)
       - `[4, 2, 3, 1]` (sorted)
       - `[2, 3, 1, 4]` (not sorted)
       - `[3, 1, 4, 2]` (not sorted)
     - This array has exactly 1 sorted cyclic shift, but we can modify it to have exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts by adjusting the values.
   - **Case \(k = 1\):**
     - The example in the problem statement shows that it's possible to have exactly one sorted cyclic shift. The program fails to handle this correctly since it prints `-1` instead of generating a valid array.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The program does not correctly handle cases where \(k < n\). Specifically, it incorrectly prints `-1` when \(k < n\). However, the provided solution does not fully address how to generate a valid array for \(k < n\).

### Correctness:
**False**

The program is incorrect because it does not generate valid arrays for cases where \(k < n\).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
