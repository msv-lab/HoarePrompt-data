Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces.
- `k` is the second integer from the input split by spaces.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as there are lines left in the input file (or standard input) beyond the first line.

The code snippet to be analyzed is:
```python
print(*[k for j in range(k)])
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The expression `[k for j in range(k)]` generates a list with `k` elements, where each element is `k`.
2. The `*` operator unpacks this list into separate arguments for the `print` function.
3. Therefore, the `print` function will print `k` occurrences of `k`.

Given that `k` is the second integer from the input split by spaces, the output will consist of `k` repetitions of the integer `k`.

Output: **k k ... k (k times)**
