Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of integers \(n\) and \(k\). It prints either a sequence of integers from 1 to \(n\) or \(-1\) based on the values of \(n\) and \(k\). Specifically, if \(k \geq 2\), it prints a sequence of \(k\) repeated \(k\) times only if \(n = k\); otherwise, it prints \(-1\). If \(k < 2\), it prints a sequence of integers from 1 to \(n\). After processing all test cases, the function terminates.**
