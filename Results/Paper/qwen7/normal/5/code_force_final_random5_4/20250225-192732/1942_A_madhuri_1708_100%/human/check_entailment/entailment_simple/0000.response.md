Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - For `t` test cases, we need to handle each one individually.
   - The program reads `n` and `k` for each test case.
   - The logic in the function needs to correctly generate an array or return `-1` based on the conditions provided.

2. **Condition Analysis**:
   - If `k >= 2`, the program checks if `n == k`. If so, it prints `[k, k, ..., k]` (an array of `k` repeated `k` times), which is always sorted.
   - If `n != k`, it prints `-1`, indicating no valid array can be formed.
   - If `k == 1`, it prints `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`, which ensures only the original array is sorted (no other cyclic shift will be sorted).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `k == 1`, the solution is correct because the only sorted cyclic shift is the original array itself.
   - When `k == 2` and `n == k`, the solution is also correct because repeating `k` twice results in an array where every cyclic shift is sorted.
   - For other values of `k` and `n`, the logic correctly identifies when no valid array exists.

4. **Validation**:
   - The program handles all given examples correctly:
     - For `2 2`, it prints `[2, 2]`.
     - For `3 1`, it prints `[1, 2, 3]`.
     - For `3 2`, it prints `-1` since no array of length 3 can have exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic for generating the required arrays or returning `-1` based on the conditions.

Correctness: **True**
