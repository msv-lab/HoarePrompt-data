Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `k` is the second integer from the input split by spaces, and the loop will continue to execute as long as there are lines left in the input file (or standard input) beyond the first line.**

This postcondition remains the same because the if and else parts do not change the values of `t`, `n`, or `k`, nor do they alter the condition under which the loop continues to execute.
