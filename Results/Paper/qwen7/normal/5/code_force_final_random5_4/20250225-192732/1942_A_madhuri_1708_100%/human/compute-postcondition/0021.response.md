Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces.
   - `k` is the second integer from the input split by spaces.
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as there are lines left in the input file (or standard input) beyond the first line.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(*[(j + 1) for j in range(n)])
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - The expression `range(n)` generates a sequence of numbers from `0` to `n-1`.
   - For each `j` in this range, `j + 1` is computed, resulting in a sequence of numbers from `1` to `n`.
   - The `*` operator is used to unpack the list into separate arguments for the `print` function.
   - Therefore, the `print` statement will output the numbers from `1` to `n` separated by spaces.

Given the initial state, the value of `n` is the first integer from the input. Let's denote this integer as `input_n`.

4. **Output**:
   - The output will be the numbers from `1` to `input_n` separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 3 ... (input_n - 1) input_n**
