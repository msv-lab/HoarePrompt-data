Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\),
- `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces,
- `k` is the second integer from the input split by spaces, and
- the current value of `k` is equal to `n`.

We need to evaluate the expression inside the `print` statement:
```python
print(*[k for j in range(k)])
```

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **List Comprehension**: `[k for j in range(k)]` creates a list with `k` elements, where each element is `k`. Since `k` is equal to `n`, this list will contain `n` elements, each being `k`.

2. **Unpacking with `*`**: The `*` operator unpacks the list into separate arguments for the `print` function. So, the `print` function will receive `n` arguments, each of which is `k`.

3. **Output**: When these arguments are printed, they will be separated by spaces by default. Therefore, the output will be `k` repeated `n` times, separated by spaces.

So, the output will be:
Output: **k k ... k (n times)**
