### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate an array \(a\) of length \(n\) such that exactly \(k\) out of the \(n\) cyclic shifts of the array are sorted.
   - If no such array exists, we should output `-1`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The function `func()` processes input from standard input.
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(k\) from the input.
   - It checks if \(k \geq 2\):
     - If \(k = n\), it prints an array where each element is equal to \(k\).
     - Otherwise, it prints `-1`.
   - If \(k < 2\), it prints an array where each element is its index plus one.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - **Case \(k = n\):**
     - If \(k = n\), the array must be such that every cyclic shift is sorted. This can only happen if all elements in the array are the same. Hence, printing an array where each element is \(k\) is correct.
   - **Case \(k < n\):**
     - If \(k < n\), the logic in the given program is incorrect because it always prints `-1`, which is not necessarily true. There could be arrays with fewer than \(n\) sorted cyclic shifts.
   - **Case \(k = 1\):**
     - The example in the problem statement shows that it's possible to have exactly one sorted cyclic shift. The program fails to handle this correctly since it prints `-1` instead of generating a valid array.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The program does not correctly handle cases where \(k < n\). Specifically, it incorrectly prints `-1` when \(k < n\).

### Correctness:
**False**

The program is incorrect because it does not generate valid arrays for cases where \(k < n\).
