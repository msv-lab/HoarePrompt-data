Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, `k` is the second integer from the input split by spaces, and the current value of `k` remains greater than or equal to 2. If `n` equals `k`, then `k` is unchanged. If `n` does not equal `k`, then `k` remains greater than or equal to 2.
