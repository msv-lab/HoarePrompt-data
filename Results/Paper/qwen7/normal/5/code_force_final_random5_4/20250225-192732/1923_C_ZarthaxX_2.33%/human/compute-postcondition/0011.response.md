Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5, `c` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `ones` is a list of length n+1 where each element is 0, `sum` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is 0, `i` is 8, `ones[8]` is `ones[7]` plus 1 if `nums[7]` equals 1, otherwise `ones[8]` is `ones[7]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ones[i]` based on the value of `nums[i-1]`. Specifically, `ones[i]` is set to `ones[i-1]` plus 1 if `nums[i-1]` is 1, or `ones[i-1]` if `nums[i-1]` is not 1. Initially, `i` is 7, so after executing the code, `i` becomes 8. The value of `ones[8]` is updated to reflect whether `nums[7]` is 1 or not.
