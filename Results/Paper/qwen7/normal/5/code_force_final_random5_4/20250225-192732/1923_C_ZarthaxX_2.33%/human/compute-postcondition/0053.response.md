Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two positive integers `n` and `q`, a list `c` of `n` positive integers, and `q` pairs of positive integers `l_i` and `r_i`. It returns the results of processing these queries based on the given conditions.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a list of integers `c` and a set of query ranges defined by `l_i` and `r_i`. The function processes each query to determine the result based on the specified conditions and returns the outcomes.
