Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `onesInRange` is defined as `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`.
   - `sumInRange` is defined as `sum[r] - sum[l]`.
   - `q` must be greater than 1.
   - `l` equals `r`.

2. **Substitute `l` with `r`:**
   - Since `l` equals `r`, we can substitute `l` with `r` in the expressions for `onesInRange` and `sumInRange`.
   - This means `onesInRange` becomes `ones[r] - ones[r - 1]`.
   - And `sumInRange` becomes `sum[r] - sum[r]`, which simplifies to `0`.

3. **Expression Simplification:**
   - The expression `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` simplifies to `2 * (ones[r] - ones[r - 1]) + (r - r + 1) - (ones[r] - ones[r - 1])`.
   - This further simplifies to `2 * (ones[r] - ones[r - 1]) + 1 - (ones[r] - ones[r - 1]) = ones[r] - ones[r - 1] + 1`.

4. **Comparison with `sumInRange`:**
   - We need to compare `ones[r] - ones[r - 1] + 1` with `sumInRange`, which is `0`.
   - So, we are comparing `ones[r] - ones[r - 1] + 1` with `0`.

5. **Determine the Outcome:**
   - Since `ones[r] - ones[r - 1]` is a non-negative integer (as it represents the count of 1s between two indices), adding `1` to it will always result in a positive number.
   - Therefore, `ones[r] - ones[r - 1] + 1` will always be greater than `0`.

6. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('YES')`.

Given this analysis, the print statement will always output `'YES'` because the comparison `ones[r] - ones[r - 1] + 1 > 0` is always true.

Output: **YES**
