Output State: **t is a positive integer, n and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5, c is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, the values of n and q are input integers.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers, `n` and `q`, from the input using `map(int, input().split(' '))`. This means that `n` and `q` are now assigned the values of the first two integers entered by the user, but their specific values are not known yet. The other variables remain unchanged.
