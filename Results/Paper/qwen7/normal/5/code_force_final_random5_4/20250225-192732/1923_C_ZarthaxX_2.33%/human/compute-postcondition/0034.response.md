The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. The conditions and values of the variables remain the same.

Output State: **`onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, `q` must be greater than 1, `l` and `r` are integers from input, and the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange` is compared with `sumInRange`.**
