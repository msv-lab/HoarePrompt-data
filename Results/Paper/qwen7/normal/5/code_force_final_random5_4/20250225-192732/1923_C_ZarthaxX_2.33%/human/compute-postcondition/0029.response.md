Based on the initial state provided:

- `onesInRange` is calculated as `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`
- `sumInRange` is calculated as `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`
- `q` is greater than 0 (though `q` is not used in the print statement)
- `l` and `r` are integers from input
- There is a condition that `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange > sumInRange`

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement will print the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `onesInRange`, `sumInRange`, `l`, `r`, or any other variables. The condition given does not affect the execution of the print statement itself; it only provides additional context about the state of the program.

Output: **NO**
