Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine whether a subarray is "good" according to the given problem description. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `onesInRange` and `sumInRange`:**
   - The variable `onesInRange` counts the number of 1s in the subarray from `l` to `r`.
   - The variable `sumInRange` calculates the sum of the elements in the subarray from `l` to `r`, adjusted by subtracting 1 for each element.
   
2. **Condition Check for "Good" Subarray:**
   - The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is not correct. This condition checks if it's possible to transform the subarray into another array `b` where the sum of elements is equal, but no element is the same as in the original subarray, and all elements in `b` are positive.

3. **Missing Key Checks:**
   - The program does not check if the subarray can be transformed into another array `b` such that the sum of elements is equal, but no element is the same as in the original subarray, and all elements in `b` are positive. Specifically, the transformation logic is missing.

### Correct Approach:
To determine if a subarray is "good," you need to check if it's possible to create another array `b` that satisfies the conditions. Here’s a corrected approach:

1. **Check if the subarray can be split into two parts with different sums:**
   - If the subarray has at least three distinct elements, it can always be transformed into another array `b` that meets the conditions.
   - If the subarray has only one or two distinct elements, it cannot be transformed into a "good" subarray.

2. **Implement the logic:**
   - Use a set to track distinct elements in the subarray.
   - Check if the subarray has at least three distinct elements.

Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

testCases = int(input())
for i in range(testCases):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, q) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    for _ in range(q):
        (l, r) = map(int, input().split(' '))
        subarray = nums[l-1:r]
        distinct_elements = set(subarray)
        if len(distinct_elements) >= 3:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

```

This version correctly checks if the subarray can be transformed into a "good" subarray by ensuring it has at least three distinct elements.
