Based on the initial state provided:

- `sumInRange` is defined as `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.
- `onesInRange` is defined as `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`.
- `q` is stated to be greater than 0.
- `l` and `r` are integers input from the user.
- There is a condition that either `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` or `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange > sumInRange`.

The `print('NO')` statement does not depend on the values of `sumInRange`, `onesInRange`, `l`, `r`, or `q`. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **'NO'**
