The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the given code snippet, and the `continue` statement itself does not change any variable values or affect the conditions outside of a loop context, the variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`
- `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l]`
- `q` must be greater than 0
- `l` and `r` are integers input from the user
- The final condition is either `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` or `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange > sumInRange`

Since the `continue` statement does not alter these values or conditions, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l]`, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` and `r` are integers input from the user, and the final condition is either `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` or `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange > sumInRange`.**
