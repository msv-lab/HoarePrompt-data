Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n + 1)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i`.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `t` is a positive integer.
   - `n` and `q` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, q \leq 3 \times 10^5\).
   - `c` is a list of \(n\) positive integers where \(1 \leq c_i \leq 10^9\).
   - `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces.
   - `ones` is a list of length \(n+1\) where each element is 0.
   - `sum` is a list of \(n+1\) elements where each element is 0.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `sum[2]` is `sum[1] + nums[1] - 1`.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be 4.

4. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop condition is `i in range(1, n + 1)`. For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than or equal to `n + 1`. Since `i` is currently 3, it is within the range as long as `n >= 3`.

5. **Adjust the States**: We only need to adjust the state of `i` to reflect the next iteration. The other states (`t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, `nums`, `ones`, `sum`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5, `c` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `ones` is a list of length n+1 where each element is 0, `sum` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is 0, `i` is 4, `sum[2]` is `sum[1] + nums[1] - 1**
