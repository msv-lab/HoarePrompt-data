Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state of the boxes into the desired state. The logic in `func_1` accurately computes the number of cats that need to be added (`cats_to_add`) and removed (`cats_to_remove`). The result is the maximum of these two values, which ensures that all necessary operations are accounted for.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program works for all cases:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases, `t`, and iterates through each test case.
2. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, it reads the number of boxes, `n`, and the strings `s1` and `s2` representing the initial and desired states, respectively.
3. **Operation Calculation**:
   - `cats_to_add` counts the number of positions where the initial state has no cat (`s1[i] == '0'`) but the desired state requires a cat (`s2[i] == '1'`).
   - `cats_to_remove` counts the number of positions where the initial state has a cat (`s1[i] == '1'`) but the desired state does not require a cat (`s2[i] == '0'`).
4. **Result**: The function returns the maximum of `cats_to_add` and `cats_to_remove`, ensuring that all necessary operations are performed.

Since the logic handles all potential cases as described, the program is correct.
