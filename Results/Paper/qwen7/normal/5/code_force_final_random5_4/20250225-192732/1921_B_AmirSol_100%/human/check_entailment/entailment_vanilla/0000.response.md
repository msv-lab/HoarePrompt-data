Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of operations needed to transform the initial state of the boxes (represented by `s1`) to the desired state (represented by `s2`).
2. The operations allowed are:
   - Adding a cat to an empty box (`b_i = 0` to `b_i = 1`).
   - Removing a cat from a non-empty box (`b_i = 1` to `b_i = 0`).
   - Moving a cat from one box to another.
3. To achieve the desired state, we need to count the number of cats that need to be added and removed.
4. Cats that are present in the initial state but absent in the desired state (`s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0'`) need to be removed.
5. Cats that are absent in the initial state but present in the desired state (`s1[i] == '0' and s2[i] == '1'`) need to be added.
6. The total number of operations will be the maximum of these two counts because each addition or removal operation can be done in one day, and moving a cat from one box to another can be considered as one operation as well.
7. The given code correctly calculates the number of cats that need to be added (`cats_to_add`) and the number of cats that need to be removed (`cats_to_remove`).
8. The function returns the maximum of these two values, which is the minimum number of operations required.

Given this analysis, the provided code logic is correct.

Correctness: **True**
