The function accepts an integer `n` and two strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1'. It calculates the maximum value between the number of boxes where `s1[i]` is '0' and `s2[i]` is '1' (indicating cats need to be added) and the number of boxes where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0' (indicating cats need to be removed). The function then returns this maximum value.
