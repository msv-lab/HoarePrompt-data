Output State: **`cats_to_add` is the number of boxes where `s1[i]` is '0' and `s2[i]` is '1', `cats_to_remove` is the number of boxes where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1'.**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `cats_to_remove` by counting the number of indices `i` where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0'. This count is stored in `cats_to_remove`. The values of `cats_to_add`, `n`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged from their initial state.
