Output State: **`cats_to_add` is the number of boxes where `s1[i]` is '0' and `s2[i]` is '1', `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1'.**

Explanation: The code calculates the number of boxes where there is no cat initially (`s1[i] == '0'`) but should have a cat eventually (`s2[i] == '1'`). This count is stored in the variable `cats_to_add`. The values of `n`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged.
