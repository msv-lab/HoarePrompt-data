Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `t`.
2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop continues as long as `i < t`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 676.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `k` is 1 or greater than or equal to 195.
   - `s` is a string containing characters from 'ù' to 'ý'.
   - `j` is 195 at the start of each iteration but changes within the loop.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 2 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, `i` will be 3 at the start of the next iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `t`. Given that `i` is now 3, `t` must still be greater than 3.

Therefore, the only states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `t`.

**State: **`t` must be greater than 3 and less than or equal to 676, `i` is 3, `k` is 1 or greater than or equal to 195, `s` is a string containing characters from 'ù' to 'ý', `j` is 195 at the start of each iteration but changes within the loop, and `n` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the loop.**
