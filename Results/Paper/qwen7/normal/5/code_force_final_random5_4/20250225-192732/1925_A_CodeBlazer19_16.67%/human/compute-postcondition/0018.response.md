Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 676, `i` is 2, `k` is an input integer, `s` is a string consisting of 9 'a's, `j` is 195, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated inputs from the user, converts them to integers, and assigns the first input to `n` and the second input to `k`. The values of `t`, `i`, `s`, and `j` remain unchanged. The conditions and values of `t` and `j` are preserved, while `n` and `k` are updated based on the user's input.
