Output State: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 676, `i` is 2, `k` must be greater than or equal to 194 (since the loop runs from 97 to k + 97, and it executes 98 times if k is 194), `s` is a string containing characters from 'ù' to 'ý' (which are the characters corresponding to ASCII values from 128 to 255), `j` is 195, `n` is an input integer.

This output state describes the final conditions of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `t` remains within the specified range, `i` stays as 2, `k` must be large enough to allow 98 iterations of the loop, `s` accumulates characters from 'ù' to 'ý' inclusive, `j` is set to 195 at the start of each iteration but changes within the loop, and `n` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the loop.
