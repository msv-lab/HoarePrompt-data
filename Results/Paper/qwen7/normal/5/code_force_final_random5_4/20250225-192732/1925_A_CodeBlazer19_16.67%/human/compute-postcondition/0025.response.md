Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 676, `i` is 2, `k` must be at least 98, `s` is 'ùjv', `j` is 196, `n` is an input integer**

Explanation: The variable `s` is updated by adding the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `j` (which is 196) to the existing string `'ùj'`. The ASCII character for 196 is `'v'`. Therefore, `s` becomes `'ùjv'`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
