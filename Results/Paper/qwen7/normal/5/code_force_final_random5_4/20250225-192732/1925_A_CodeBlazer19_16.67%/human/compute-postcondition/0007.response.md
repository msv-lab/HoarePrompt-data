Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 676, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k + 97` is a valid upper bound, `s` is 'aa', `j` is 98**

The code `s += chr(j)` appends the character represented by `chr(98)`, which is 'b', to the string `s`. Since `s` was initially 'a', after the operation, `s` becomes 'aa'. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k + 97`, and `j` remain unchanged.
