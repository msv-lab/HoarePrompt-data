Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
2. The provided solution attempts to calculate the cost based on the positions of '1's and '0's in the string.
3. The logic in `func_1` seems flawed because:
   - It incorrectly calculates the cost by assuming that every '0' after a '1' contributes to the cost as `one + 1`.
   - It does not account for the actual minimum cost required to sort the string through cyclic shifts.
4. The provided example outputs do not match the expected behavior of the given code. For instance, for the string "101011", the output should be 3 (not 9), as the optimal strategy would be:
   - Shift "101011" to "010111" (cost = 3).
5. The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost of sorting the string through cyclic shifts.

Correctness: **False**
