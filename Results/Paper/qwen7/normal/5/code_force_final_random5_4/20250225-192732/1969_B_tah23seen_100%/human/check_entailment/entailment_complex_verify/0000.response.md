### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not accurately calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The annotated code and the provided explanation highlight several issues with the current implementation:

1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The current implementation adds `one + 1` for each '0' encountered after a sequence of '1's, which does not account for the optimal cost of cyclic shifts. For instance, in the string "101011", the cost should be calculated differently to reflect the minimum number of shifts needed.

2. **Lack of Optimal Strategy**: The current logic does not consider the optimal strategy for sorting the string, which involves identifying the longest prefix of '1's and then calculating the cost based on the positions of '0's relative to this prefix.

Given the corrected function provided in the original assessment, let's analyze it step-by-step:

```python
def func_1(s):
    cost = 0
    max_one_length = 0
    one_count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            one_count += 1
            max_one_length = max(max_one_length, one_count)
        else:
            one_count = 0
    # Calculate the cost based on the longest prefix of '1's
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '0':
            cost += len(s) - i
    return cost - max_one_length
```

- **First Loop**: This loop counts the length of the longest prefix of '1's and updates `max_one_length`.
- **Second Loop**: This loop calculates the cost by adding the distance from the current position to the end of the string for each '0'. This reflects the cost of moving the '0' to its correct position in the sorted string.

By following this approach, the function correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was accurate in identifying the issues with the provided program and providing a corrected version. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

**Final: True**
