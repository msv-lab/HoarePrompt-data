Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts of substrings.
2. The annotated program correctly implements a solution that calculates the cost based on the positions of '1's and '0's in the string.
3. The function `func_1` iterates through the string `s` and counts the number of '1's encountered until a '0' is found. For each '0', it adds `one + 1` to the cost, which represents the minimum cost to move all '1's before the current '0' to the beginning of the substring up to the current position.
4. Additionally, for each '1' in the string, it adds 2 to the cost, which seems to be an unnecessary part of the logic since the actual cost calculation should only depend on the positions of '0's relative to '1's.
5. However, the core logic of adding `one + 1` for each '0' after a sequence of '1's is correct and would give the right cost if the additional 2 per '1' was not included.
6. Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the function correctly computes the minimum cost as required.

Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The function `func_1` incorrectly adds 2 to the cost for each '1' in the string, which is not part of the correct logic for calculating the minimum cost. The correct approach should only add `one + 1` for each '0' encountered after a sequence of '1's. The additional 2 for each '1' is unnecessary and incorrect. Therefore, the function is not fully correct according to the problem statement.
