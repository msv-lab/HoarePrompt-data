Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. Specifically, the program fails to account for the correct cost calculation for cyclic shifts. The current implementation assumes that each time a '0' is encountered after a sequence of '1's, the cost is `one + 1`, which is not always correct.

For example, consider the string "101011":
- The program would incorrectly calculate the cost as follows:
  - First '0' after '11': cost = 3 (incorrect)
  - Second '0' after '1': cost = 2 (incorrect)

However, the correct approach involves finding the longest prefix of '1's and then calculating the cost based on the positions of '0's relative to this prefix. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    cost = 0
    max_one_length = 0
    one_count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            one_count += 1
            max_one_length = max(max_one_length, one_count)
        else:
            one_count = 0
    # Calculate the cost based on the longest prefix of '1's
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '0':
            cost += len(s) - i
    return cost - max_one_length
```

This corrected function properly calculates the minimum cost to sort the string by considering the longest prefix of '1's and the positions of '0's.
