### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding and Input/Output Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling the function `func_1(s)`.
   - The function `func_1(s)` is responsible for calculating the minimum total cost to make the binary string `s` sorted in non-descending order.

2. **Function `func_1(s)` Analysis:**
   - The function initializes `cost` to 0 and `one` to 0.
   - It iterates through each character in the string `s`.
     - If the character is '1', it increments the counter `one`.
     - If the character is '0' and there has been at least one '1' encountered (`one > 0`), it adds `one + 1` to the `cost`.

3. **Cost Calculation Logic:**
   - The logic for adding `one + 1` to the `cost` when encountering a '0' after at least one '1' is correct. This is because moving a '0' to the beginning of the sequence of '1's would indeed require a cost equal to the length of that sequence plus one.
   - However, the original assessment incorrectly states that the initial cost of 2 for each iteration where `i` is '1' is necessary. This is not required because the cost is already correctly calculated by the logic inside the loop.

4. **Example Cases Verification:**
   - For "10", the cost is 2 (shift the entire string). This is correct.
   - For "0000", no shifts are needed, so the cost is 0. This is correct.
   - For "11000", the cost is calculated as 3 + 3 + 3 = 9. This is correct.
   - For "101011", the cost is 5. This is correct.
   - For "01101001", the cost is 11. This is correct.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The function `func_1(s)` correctly calculates the minimum total cost to make the binary string `s` sorted in non-descending order.
   - The original assessment incorrectly includes an initial cost of 2 for each iteration where `i` is '1', which is not necessary and does not affect the correctness of the overall logic.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct as it accurately calculates the minimum total cost to make the binary string `s` sorted in non-descending order.
