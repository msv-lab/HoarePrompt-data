Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `s` is a non-empty binary string with its first character removed.
   - `i` is the second character of `s`.
   - `one` is either 2 or 3.
   - `cost` is either increased by 2 or increased by `one + 1` if `i` is '0' and `one` is greater than 0. Otherwise, `one` and `cost` remain unchanged.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
   - The variable `i` is set to the current character in each iteration.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over each character in `s`, the string `s` itself will change with each iteration.
   - Initially, `i` is the second character of `s`. After the first iteration, `i` becomes the third character of the new `s` (which is the original `s` minus its first two characters).
   - `one` and `cost` will be updated based on the value of `i` and the condition given.

Given these points, let's determine the state at the start of the next iteration:

- The string `s` will lose its first character, making it one character shorter.
- `i` will be the third character of the new `s` (since it was the second character before the removal of the first character).
- `one` and `cost` will be updated based on the value of `i` and the condition given.

Since `s` is a non-empty binary string, removing the first character still leaves us with a non-empty binary string. The value of `i` will be the third character of the new `s`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**State: **`s` is a non-empty binary string with its first two characters removed, `i` is the third character of `s`, `one` is either 2 or 3, `cost` is either increased by 2 or increased by `one + 1` if `i` is '0' and `one` is greater than 0. Otherwise, `one` and `cost` remain unchanged.**
