Reasoning:
1. The provided program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling the function `func_1(s)`.
2. The function `func_1(s)` calculates the minimum total cost to make the binary string `s` sorted in non-descending order.
3. The logic in `func_1(s)` works as follows:
   - It initializes `cost` to 0 and `one` to 0.
   - It iterates through each character in the string `s`.
   - If the character is '1', it increments the counter `one`.
   - If the character is '0' and there has been at least one '1' encountered (`one > 0`), it adds `one + 1` to the `cost`. This is because moving a '0' to the beginning of the sequence of '1's would require a cost equal to the length of that sequence plus one.
4. The provided example cases are correctly handled by this logic:
   - For "10", the cost is 2 (shift the entire string).
   - For "0000", no shifts are needed, so the cost is 0.
   - For "11000", the cost is calculated as 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 (as explained in the problem statement).
   - For "101011", the cost is 5 (explained similarly).
   - For "01101001", the cost is 11 (explained similarly).

Given that the logic in `func_1(s)` correctly calculates the minimum total cost according to the problem statement and handles the examples provided, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
