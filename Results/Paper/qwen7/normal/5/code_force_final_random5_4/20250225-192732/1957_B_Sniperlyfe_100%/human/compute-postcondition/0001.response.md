Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5; `nums` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros; `nums[0]` is equal to (1 << (`k`.bit_length() - 1)) - 1.**

Explanation: The code sets `nums[0]` to a specific value based on the bit length of `k`. Specifically, `1 << k.bit_length() - 1` shifts the number 1 left by `k.bit_length() - 1` positions, which effectively creates a binary number with `k.bit_length()` bits all set to 1. Subtracting 1 from this value flips all the bits to 0 except for the highest bit, which remains 1. This results in a number with `k.bit_length()` bits, all set to 1, except for the highest bit, which is 0. This value is assigned to `nums[0]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
