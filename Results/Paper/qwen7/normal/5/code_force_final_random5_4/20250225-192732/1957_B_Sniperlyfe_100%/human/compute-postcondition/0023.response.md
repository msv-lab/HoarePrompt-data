Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, and `k` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^9. The function returns a list `nums` containing `n` elements. The first element `nums[0]` is set to `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`. For each subsequent element `nums[i]` (where `i` ranges from 1 to `n-1`), the value is set to `0` if `k` is non-positive.**

This means the function creates a list of size `n` where the first element is calculated based on the bit length of `k` minus one, shifted left by one and then decremented by one. All other elements in the list are zero if `k` is less than or equal to zero.
