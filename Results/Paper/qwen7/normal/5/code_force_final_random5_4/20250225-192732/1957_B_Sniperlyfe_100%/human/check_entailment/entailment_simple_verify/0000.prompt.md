You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
    nums[0] += k
    return nums



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and k are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `k` will be less than or equal to 0, and `nums` will contain `n` elements where the first element `nums[0]` is `(1 << (`k`.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`, and each subsequent element `nums[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`) will be `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` if `k` was still positive after the previous iterations, otherwise `nums[i]` will be 0.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes, the index `i` will be equal to the length of the `nums` list (`n`), meaning the loop has processed all elements. The variable `k` will either be fully consumed (less than or equal to 0) or reduced to 0 during the last iteration if it couldn't be further decremented due to its value being smaller than `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`. The `nums` list will start with a specific value based on `k` and then each following element will be the minimum possible value `k` could take in each iteration, ensuring no further decrements are possible.
    nums[0] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list `nums` containing `n` elements. The first element `nums[0]` is `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`, and each subsequent element `nums[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`) is `0` since `k` is non-positive.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the bitwise OR of the sequence maximizes the number of 1s in its binary representation. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `2 5`
- Expected Output: A sequence like `[5, 0]` or `[4, 1]` because `5 | 0 = (101)_2` and `4 | 1 = (100) | (001) = (101)_2`, both having three 1s in their binary representation.

However, the current implementation sets `nums[0]` to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is the largest number with `k.bit_length()` bits set to 1. This approach does not guarantee that the bitwise OR of the entire sequence will maximize the number of 1s.

A correct approach would involve distributing the value of `k` across the sequence in a way that maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence. For example, setting `nums[0]` to `k - 1` and the rest to 1s could be a better strategy in some cases.

Here's an alternative correct solution:
```python
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    if k <= n:
        nums[:k] = [1] * k
    else:
        nums[0] = k - (n - 1)
        for i in range(1, n):
            nums[i] = 1
    return nums
```

This solution ensures that the bitwise OR of the sequence is maximized by setting the first few elements to 1s and the rest to 0s if `k` is less than or equal to `n`. If `k` is greater than `n`, it sets the first element to `k - (n - 1)` and the rest to 1s.
