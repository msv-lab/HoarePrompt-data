You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
    nums[0] += k
    return nums



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and k are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `k` will be less than or equal to 0, and `nums` will contain `n` elements where the first element `nums[0]` is `(1 << (`k`.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`, and each subsequent element `nums[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`) will be `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` if `k` was still positive after the previous iterations, otherwise `nums[i]` will be 0.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes, the index `i` will be equal to the length of the `nums` list (`n`), meaning the loop has processed all elements. The variable `k` will either be fully consumed (less than or equal to 0) or reduced to 0 during the last iteration if it couldn't be further decremented due to its value being smaller than `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`. The `nums` list will start with a specific value based on `k` and then each following element will be the minimum possible value `k` could take in each iteration, ensuring no further decrements are possible.
    nums[0] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list `nums` containing `n` elements. The first element `nums[0]` is `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`, and each subsequent element `nums[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`) is `0` since `k` is non-positive.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of elements in the list `nums` and `k` is an integer. It initializes a list `nums` of size `n` with all elements set to 0. The first element `nums[0]` is set to `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`. If `k` is greater than 0 after processing the first element, subsequent elements in `nums` are set to the minimum possible value of `k` that can be subtracted, ensuring `k` becomes non-positive. Finally, any remaining value of `k` is added to `nums[0]`. The function returns the list `nums` with these properties.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is supposed to generate a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that satisfy the given conditions.
   - The function initializes an array `nums` of size `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - It sets the first element `nums[0]` to `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`. This value is the largest number with a specific number of bits (equal to the bit length of `k` minus one).
   - It subtracts this value from `k`.
   - For each subsequent element in the array, it tries to add the minimum possible value that keeps the sum equal to `k` while maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence.
   - Finally, it adjusts the first element to ensure the total sum is `k`.

3. **Output Generation:**
   - The program collects the results of `func_1` for each test case.
   - It formats the results as strings and joins them with spaces.
   - It prints the formatted results for each test case.

### Verification of Correctness:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Setting `nums[0]` to `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1` ensures that the first element is the largest number with the required number of bits. This helps in maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR operation.

2. **Subsequent Elements:**
   - The loop for setting subsequent elements ensures that each element is as small as possible while still contributing to the sum `k`. This helps in maintaining the sum constraint and maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR operation.

3. **Final Adjustment:**
   - Adjusting `nums[0]` to ensure the total sum is `k` after setting the other elements ensures that the sum condition is met.

### Testing the Functionality:

Let's test the function with the provided examples:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `1 5`
  - Expected Output: `5`
  - Explanation: The only integer is 5, and it satisfies the sum condition.

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `2 3`
  - Expected Output: `1 2`
  - Explanation: `1 + 2 = 3` and `1 | 2 = 3` (binary: `11`), which has two 1s.

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `2 5`
  - Expected Output: `5 0`
  - Explanation: `5 + 0 = 5` and `5 | 0 = 5` (binary: `101`), which has three 1s.

- **Example 4:**
  - Input: `6 51`
  - Expected Output: `3 1 1 32 2 12`
  - Explanation: `3 + 1 + 1 + 32 + 2 + 12 = 51` and `3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = 101111` (binary: `101111`), which has five 1s.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to generate a sequence of integers that meet the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.
