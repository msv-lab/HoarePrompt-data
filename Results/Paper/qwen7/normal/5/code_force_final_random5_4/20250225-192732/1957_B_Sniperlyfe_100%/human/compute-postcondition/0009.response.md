Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `k` is updated to `k - nums[1]`
   - `nums[i]` is set to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`, the next value of `i` will be `2` (since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration).
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than `2` (because `i` will now be 2).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be updated to `2`.
   - `n` must still be greater than `2`.

6. **Consider other variables**:
   - The value of `k` and `nums` are not directly affected by the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted here.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**
