The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of elements in the list `nums` and `k` is an integer. It initializes a list `nums` of size `n` with all elements set to 0. The first element `nums[0]` is set to `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`. If `k` is greater than 0 after processing the first element, subsequent elements in `nums` are set to the minimum possible value of `k` that can be subtracted, ensuring `k` becomes non-positive. Finally, any remaining value of `k` is added to `nums[0]`. The function returns the list `nums` with these properties.
