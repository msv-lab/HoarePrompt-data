Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, the function `func_1` is called with `n` and `k` as arguments.
3. The function `func_1` constructs a list `nums` of length `n`:
   - The first element `nums[0]` is set to `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`, which is the largest number with at most `k` bits set to 1.
   - Subsequent elements are set to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` if `k` is still positive, otherwise they are set to 0.
   - Any remaining value of `k` is added to `nums[0]`.
4. This approach ensures that the sum of the elements in `nums` equals `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR.
5. The function returns the constructed list `nums`, and the main program prints the lists for each test case.

Based on the provided explanation and the logic of the function, the program appears to meet the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
