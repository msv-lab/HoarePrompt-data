Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range specified as `range(1, n)`. This means `i` will start from 1 and go up to `n-1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, we need to ensure that `i` is set to 1 at the beginning of the loop.

3. **Determine the value of `n`**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Check the other given variables**: The variables `t`, `k`, and `nums` are not directly involved in the loop condition or the loop body. They are provided as context but do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given these points, we can summarize the required adjustments:

- `i` should be set to 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the modified state before the loop starts is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
