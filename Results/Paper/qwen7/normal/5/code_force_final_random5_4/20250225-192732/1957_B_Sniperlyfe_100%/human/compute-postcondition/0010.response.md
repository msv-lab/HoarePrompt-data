Output State: **`i` is 2; `nums[i]` is `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` to `nums[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 2, `nums[i]` is updated to the minimum value between `nums[0] + 1` and `k`. The initial value of `i` remains unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be greater than 2 is still valid.
