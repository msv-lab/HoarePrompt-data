### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotated code to verify the correctness of the solution.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function initializes an array `nums` of size `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - It sets the first element `nums[0]` to `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`. This value is the largest number with a specific number of bits (equal to the bit length of `k` minus one).
   - It subtracts this value from `k`.
   - For each subsequent element in the array, it tries to add the minimum possible value that keeps the sum equal to `k` while maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence.
   - Finally, it adjusts the first element to ensure the total sum is `k`.

3. **Output Generation:**
   - The program collects the results of `func_1` for each test case.
   - It formats the results as strings and joins them with spaces.
   - It prints the formatted results for each test case.

#### Verification of Correctness:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Setting `nums[0]` to `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1` ensures that the first element is the largest number with the required number of bits. This helps in maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR operation.

2. **Subsequent Elements:**
   - The loop for setting subsequent elements ensures that each element is as small as possible while still contributing to the sum `k`. This helps in maintaining the sum constraint and maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR operation.

3. **Final Adjustment:**
   - Adjusting `nums[0]` to ensure the total sum is `k` after setting the other elements ensures that the sum condition is met.

#### Testing the Functionality:

Let's test the function with the provided examples:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `1 5`
  - Expected Output: `5`
  - Explanation: The only integer is 5, and it satisfies the sum condition.

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `2 3`
  - Expected Output: `1 2`
  - Explanation: `1 + 2 = 3` and `1 | 2 = 3` (binary: `11`), which has two 1s.

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `2 5`
  - Expected Output: `5 0`
  - Explanation: `5 + 0 = 5` and `5 | 0 = 5` (binary: `101`), which has three 1s.

- **Example 4:**
  - Input: `6 51`
  - Expected Output: `3 1 1 32 2 12`
  - Explanation: `3 + 1 + 1 + 32 + 2 + 12 = 51` and `3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = 101111` (binary: `101111`), which has five 1s.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to generate a sequence of integers that meet the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.
