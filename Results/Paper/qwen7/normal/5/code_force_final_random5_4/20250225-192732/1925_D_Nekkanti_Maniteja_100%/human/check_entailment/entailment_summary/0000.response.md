Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Combinatorial Factor Calculation**: The program calculates \( c \) as the modular multiplicative inverse of the total number of unique pairs (\( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \)) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \). This is necessary for the combinatorial calculations.
3. **Friendship Value Summation**: The program correctly sums the friendship values for all pairs of friends.
4. **Expected Value Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all \( k \) excursions. However, the formula used in the program is incorrect. Specifically, the formula `c * i * c * m + c * a` does not accurately represent the expected value calculation for the problem.

The correct approach to calculate the expected value involves considering the probability of selecting a friend pair and the expected increase in the friendship value due to the excursion.

Given the problem's requirements, the correct expected value for each excursion should be calculated as follows:
- For each pair of friends, the probability of being selected in an excursion is \( \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \).
- The expected increase in friendship value for each pair of friends per excursion is \( \frac{1}{n(n-1)} \).

Thus, the expected value for the sum of friendship values for all \( k \) excursions is:
\[ \text{Expected Value} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i \times k \]

However, the program incorrectly uses a different formula which does not reflect the actual expected value calculation.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it does not properly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all \( k \) excursions.

Correctness: **False**
