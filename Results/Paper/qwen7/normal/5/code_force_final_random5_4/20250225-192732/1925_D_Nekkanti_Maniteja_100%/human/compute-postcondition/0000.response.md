Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is initialized by the expression `range(int(input()))`.

2. **Understand the Range Function**: The `range(int(input()))` function will generate a sequence of numbers starting from 0 up to (but not including) the value of `int(input())`. This means that `i` will take on values from 0 to `t-1`, where `t` is the integer input.

3. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 0` and increments `i` until it reaches `t-1`, the initial value of `i` should be 0.

4. **Determine the Value of `t`**: The value of `t` is given as an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4`. Therefore, `t` must be set to this value for the loop to execute properly.

5. **Other States**: The other states mentioned in the problem (such as `n`, `m`, `k`, `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given these points, we can conclude that the only states that need to be adjusted are `t` and `i`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, `i` is 0**
