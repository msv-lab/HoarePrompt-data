The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \). For each test case, it reads pairs of friends and their associated values, calculates a weighted sum based on these values and combinatorial factors, and prints the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \). The function does not return any value but prints the calculated result for each test case.
