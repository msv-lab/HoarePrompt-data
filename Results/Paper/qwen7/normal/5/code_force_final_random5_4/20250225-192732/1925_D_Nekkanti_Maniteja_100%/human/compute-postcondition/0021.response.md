Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `i` is 4, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(n \cdot (n - 1) // 2\) modulo `M`, `s` is `s + c * i * c * m + c * a`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided as input over the iterations, `m` must be greater than 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 3**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `s` by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a` to its current value. Since `i` is 4, the term `c * i * c * m` becomes `4 * c * c * m`. The value of `c` and `m` remain unchanged as they are not redefined in the code snippet. The value of `a` remains unchanged as it is the sum of all `f` values provided as input over the iterations and is not modified in the given code. All other variables (`t`, `M`, `u`, `v`, `f`, `k`) are not affected by the code snippet.
