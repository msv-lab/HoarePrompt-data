Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Calculating the Total Number of Possible Pairs:**
   - The variable `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children, which is `n * (n - 1) // 2`. This is done using `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`.

3. **Summing Friendship Values:**
   - The variable `a` is initialized to 0.
   - For each of the `m` pairs, the program reads `u`, `v`, and `f`, and adds `f` to `a`.

4. **Calculating Expected Sum:**
   - The variable `s` is initialized to 0.
   - For each of the `k` excursions, the program updates `s` using the formula `c * i * c * m + c * a`.

5. **Printing Result:**
   - Finally, the program prints `s % M`.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value:**
   - The program incorrectly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The expected value should be calculated considering the probability of picking each pair and the effect of increasing the friendship value over time.
   - The formula used in the program `c * i * c * m + c * a` does not correctly represent the expected value of the sum of friendship values.

2. **Modular Inverse Usage:**
   - While the use of modular inverse is correct for calculating the probability of picking a pair, the way it is used in the final calculation is incorrect.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion. The correct approach involves:

1. **Calculate the Probability of Picking Each Pair:**
   - The probability of picking any specific pair in one excursion is `1 / (n * (n - 1) // 2)`.

2. **Expected Increase in Friendship Value:**
   - For each pair of friends, the expected increase in friendship value per excursion is the probability of picking that pair multiplied by the number of times it can be picked (which is `k`).

3. **Summing the Expected Values:**
   - Sum the expected increases for all pairs to get the total expected sum.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
