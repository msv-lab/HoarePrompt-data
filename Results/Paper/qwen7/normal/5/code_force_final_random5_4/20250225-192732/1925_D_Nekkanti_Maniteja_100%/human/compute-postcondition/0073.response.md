Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 1`, `k` must be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 19`, `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers obtained from the input split, `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided by the input over all iterations, `s` is updated to `s + c * (i_prev + 1) * c * m + c * a`**.

This means that the variable `i` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value (`i_prev + 1`), while `k` remains greater than or equal to `i_prev + 19`. The variables `u`, `v`, and `f` remain unchanged as they were obtained from the input split. The variable `a` remains the sum of all `f` values provided by the input over all iterations. Lastly, `s` has been updated to its previous value plus `c * (i_prev + 1) * c * m + c * a`.
