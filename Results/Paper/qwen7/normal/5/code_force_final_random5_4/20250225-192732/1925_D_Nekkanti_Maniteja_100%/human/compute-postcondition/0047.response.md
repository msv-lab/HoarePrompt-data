Output State: **`s` is updated to `s + c * (i_prev + 3) * c * m + c * a`, `u` remains the first input integer, `v` remains the second input integer, `f` remains the third input integer, `a` remains the sum of all input integers `f` provided during the loop executions, `i` is now `i_prev + 3`, `m` must be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 3`, `c` and `M` remain unchanged.**

This means that the value of `s` has been updated according to the formula given, while the other variables retain their previous states as described in the initial state.
