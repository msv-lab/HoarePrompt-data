Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 6`, `m` must be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 6`, `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers obtained from the input split.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `u`, `v`, and `f`. The values of `i` and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `i` is still `i_prev + 6`, and `m` must still be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 6`. The values of `u`, `v`, and `f` are the integers obtained from the input split.
