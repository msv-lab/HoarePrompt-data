Output State: **`u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `a` is `a` plus `f`**.

Explanation: The code `a += f` increments the value of `a` by the value of `f`. Since the initial values of `u`, `v`, and `f` are provided from the input, their values remain unchanged. The value of `a` is updated to be its original value plus the value of `f`.
