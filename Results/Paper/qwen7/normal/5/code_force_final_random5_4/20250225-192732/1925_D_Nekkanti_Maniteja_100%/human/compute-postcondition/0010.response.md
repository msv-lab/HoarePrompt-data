Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(m)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\)
   - `i` is 0
   - `M` is 1000000007
   - `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(n \cdot (n - 1) // 2\) modulo `M`
   - `s` is 0
   - `a` is `a` + `f`
   - `m` must be greater than 0
   - `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers obtained from the input split.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < m`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1.
   - The value of `m` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise in the loop body, but since no such change is mentioned, `m` stays the same.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `m`.

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), `i` is 1, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \(n \cdot (n - 1) // 2\) modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is `a` + `f`, `m` must be greater than 0, `u`, `v`, and `f` are integers obtained from the input split.**
