Output State: `u` is the first input integer, `v` is the second input integer, `f` is the third input integer, `a` is the sum of all input integers `f` provided during the loop executions, `i` is `i_prev + 2`, `m` must be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 2`, and all other variables (`s`, `c`, `M`) remain unchanged.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `u` and `v` will hold the values of the first two input integers provided, `f` will hold the value of the third input integer, `a` will be the cumulative sum of all `f` values provided as inputs, `i` will be the total number of iterations plus one, and `m` will be at least equal to the total number of iterations. The variables `s`, `c`, and `M` will retain their initial values since they are not affected by the loop.
