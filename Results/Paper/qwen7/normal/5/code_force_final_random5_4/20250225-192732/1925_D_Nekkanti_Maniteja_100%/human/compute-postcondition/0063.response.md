Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 7`, `m` must be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 7`, `u` is the first integer input, `v` is the second integer input, `f` is the third integer input, `a` is increased by `f`.**

Explanation: The code `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())` takes three integers as input and splits them into `u`, `v`, and `f`. It does not affect the values of `i` and `m`, which remain as per the initial state. Additionally, `a` is increased by the value of `f`.
