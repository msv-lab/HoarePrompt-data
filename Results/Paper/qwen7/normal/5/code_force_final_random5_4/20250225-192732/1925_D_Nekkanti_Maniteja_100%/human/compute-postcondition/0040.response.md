Output State: **`u` is the first input integer, `v` is the second input integer, `f` is the third input integer, `a` is `a + f`, `i` is `i_prev + 2`, `m` must be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 2`.**

Explanation: The code `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `u`, `v`, and `f` respectively. The values of `a`, `i`, and `m` remain unchanged from their previous states, with `a` being updated to `a + f` and `i` being updated to `i_prev + 2`. The condition for `m` remains that it must be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 2`.
