Output State: **`u` is the first input integer, `v` is the second input integer, `f` is the third input integer, `a` is the sum of all input integers `f` provided during the loop executions, `i` is `i_prev + 2`, `m` must be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 2`, `s` is updated to `s + c * i * c * m + c * a`, and `c`, `M` remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the values of `u`, `v`, `f`, `a`, `i`, and `m` follow their initial conditions or the conditions specified in the initial state. The variable `s` is updated by adding the expression `c * i * c * m + c * a` to its current value. The variables `c` and `M` remain unchanged from their initial or previously set values.
