Postcondition: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0] - 2`, `count_u` is the number of 'U' in the string `s`, `n` is now `int(data[index + 2])`, `s` is now `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by 6, and `count_u` is the number of 'U' in the updated string `s`.**

This postcondition remains the same for both the if and else parts because the preconditions and the updates to the variables are identical in both cases. The if condition does not change the overall state of the variables, and the else condition does not introduce any new changes either. Therefore, the postcondition is the same as the precondition.
