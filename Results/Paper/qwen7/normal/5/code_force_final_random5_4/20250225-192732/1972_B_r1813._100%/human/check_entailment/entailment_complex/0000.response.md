Reasoning:

1. The annotated program correctly reads the input and processes each test case as specified.
2. The function `func_1()` correctly handles multiple test cases, reading the necessary values from the input string.
3. For each test case, it calculates the number of 'U' characters in the string `s`.
4. Based on whether the count of 'U' characters is odd or even, it prints "YES" or "NO" respectively.
5. The state description at the end of the function matches the expected behavior: `t` is reduced by 3 after processing all test cases, and the variables `n` and `s` are updated accordingly for the next iteration.
6. The logic for determining the winner is correct according to the problem statement: Alice wins if the count of 'U' characters is odd, and Bob wins if it is even.

Given these points, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
