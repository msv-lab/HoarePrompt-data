Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0] - 2`, `count_u` is the number of 'U' in string `s`, `n` is now `int(data[index + 2])`, `s` is `data[5]`, and `index` is increased by 4.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n = int(data[index])` assigns the value of `data[index]` (which is `data[index + 2]` since `index` was previously increased by 2) to `n` after converting it to an integer. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
