Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]`, `n` is an integer from `data[index]`, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `index` is 2, `t` must be greater than 0**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(data[index])` assigns the value of `data[index]` to `n` after converting it to an integer. Since `index` was initially 1, after executing this line, `index` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
