Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `index` is 1.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `index` to 1. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
