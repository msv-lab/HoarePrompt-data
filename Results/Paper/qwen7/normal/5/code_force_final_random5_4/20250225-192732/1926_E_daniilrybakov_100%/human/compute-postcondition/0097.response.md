Output State: `s` is the sum of `x` values from each iteration, `n` is reduced to `n // 2 ** 3` (since the loop runs 3 times), `k` is an input integer, `m` is 8 (since it doubles every iteration and does so 3 times), `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`.

To explain further, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `s` accumulates the value of `x` from each iteration. The variable `n` is halved three times, resulting in `n` being `n // 8`. The variable `m` doubles with each iteration, so after 3 iterations, `m` becomes `2^3 = 8`. The variable `x` takes the value `(n + 1) // 2` at the start of the last iteration, as `n` is now significantly smaller due to repeated halving.
