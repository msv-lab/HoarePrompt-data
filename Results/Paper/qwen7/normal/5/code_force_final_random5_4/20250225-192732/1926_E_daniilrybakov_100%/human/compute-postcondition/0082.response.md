Output State: **`s` is `x`, `n` is `n // 2`, and `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2`. Since `n` is initially `n // 2` and must be at least 2, the new value of `x` is calculated based on the updated `n`. The values of `s` and the initial condition that `n` is at least 2 are preserved.
