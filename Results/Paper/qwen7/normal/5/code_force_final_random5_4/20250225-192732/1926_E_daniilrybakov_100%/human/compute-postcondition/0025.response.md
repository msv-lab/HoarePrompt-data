Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50000, `n` is now `n // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s + (n + 1) // 2 + x`, `m` is 4, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`**.

Explanation: The code `n //= 2` divides `n` by 2 and assigns the result back to `n`. The other variables (`t`, `k`, `s`, `m`, and `x`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain as they were initially, except for `n` which is now updated to `n // 2`.
