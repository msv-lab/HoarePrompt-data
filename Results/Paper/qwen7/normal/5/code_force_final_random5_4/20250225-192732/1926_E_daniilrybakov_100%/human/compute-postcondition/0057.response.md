Output State: **`s` is 0 + (n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 2, `n` is greater than 0 and halved, `k` is an input integer, `m` is 4, `x` is (n + 1) // 2**

Explanation: The code `n //= 2` divides `n` by 2 and assigns the result back to `n`. Since `n` was initially greater than 0, after the operation, `n` is now `n // 2`. All other variables (`s`, `k`, `m`, and `x`) remain unchanged.
