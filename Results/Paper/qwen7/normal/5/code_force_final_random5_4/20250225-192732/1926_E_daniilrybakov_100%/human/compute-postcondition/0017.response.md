Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5â‹…10^4, `n` is now `n` // 2, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s + (n + 1) // 2`, `m` is 2, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2**.

Explanation: The code `n //= 2` divides `n` by 2 and assigns the quotient back to `n`. All other variables (`t`, `k`, `s`, `m`, and `x`) remain unchanged. The value of `n` is updated to its half, while the conditions and values of the other variables are kept as they were in the initial state.
