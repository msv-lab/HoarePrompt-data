Postcondition: `ans` is the maximum value among 7, 5, and `x // 5`, `i` is 7, `x` is an integer, and `l` is a list containing `[ans, 5, 5, x // 5]` if `x % 5 == 0`. If `x % 8 == 0` and `x // 8 <= k`, then `ans` is the maximum value among 7, 1, and `x // 5`, and `l` is a list containing `[ans, 7, 1]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains the maximum value among 7, 5, and `x // 5`, and `l` is a list containing `[ans, 5, 5, x // 5]`.
