Postcondition: `x` is an integer, `i` is a divisor of `x`, and `l` is a list. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` contains either `['ans']` (where `ans` is the maximum value in `l`) or `['ans', i]` or `['ans', i, x // i]` (where `ans` is the maximum value in `l`). If `i` is greater than `k`, `l` remains as `['ans']` (where `ans` is the maximum value in `l`).
