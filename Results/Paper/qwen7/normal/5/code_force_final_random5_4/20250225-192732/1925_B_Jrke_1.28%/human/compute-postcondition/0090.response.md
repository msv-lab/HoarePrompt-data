Postcondition: `x` is an input integer, `i` is 5 if `x` is odd, otherwise `i` is 6, `l` is a list containing the elements `ans` (which is the maximum value between `ans` and `i`), `i`, and if `x % i == 0`, then `x // i` is appended to the list `l` and `i` remains less than `int(x)`. If `x % i == 0`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum value between `ans` and `i`, and `x // i` is appended to `l`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.
