Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `i` is 3 if `x` is odd, otherwise `i` is 4, `l` is a list containing the elements `ans` and `i`, and `ans` is the maximum value between `ans` and `i`, and `i` must be less than `int(x)`**

Explanation: The code `l.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. Since `i` is already defined as either 3 (if `x` is odd) or 4 (if `x` is even), and `i` must be less than `int(x)`, the list `l` now contains both `ans` and the current value of `i`.
