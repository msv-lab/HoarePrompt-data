Output State: **`x` is an integer, `i` is a divisor of `x`, `l` is a list containing ['ans', `i`, `x // i`], where `ans` is the maximum value among the elements in `l`.**

Explanation: The code appends `x // i` to the list `l`. Since `i` is a divisor of `x`, `x // i` is an integer. The list `l` initially contains `['ans', i]`, where `ans` is the maximum value between `'ans'` (a string) and `i`. After appending `x // i`, `l` now contains `['ans', i, x // i]`. The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum value among these three elements (`'ans'`, `i`, and `x // i`).
