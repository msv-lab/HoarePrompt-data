Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop starts with `i` set to `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0)`.
   - The loop increments `i` by 2 each iteration.
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is the maximum value among `ans`, 5, and `x // 5`.
   - `i` is 5.
   - `x` is an integer.
   - `l` is a list containing `[ans, 5, 5, x // 5]` if `x % 5 == 0`.

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 5, we need to check if `5 <= int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - If `5 <= int(x ** 0.5) + 1` is true, then `i` will be incremented by 2 to become 7.
   - Therefore, `i` must be 7 for the loop to continue.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Since `i` is the only variable in the loop head that needs adjustment, and it must be 7 for the loop to continue, we update the state accordingly.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans` is the maximum value among `ans`, 5, and `x // 5`, `i` is 7, `x` is an integer, and `l` is a list containing `[ans, 5, 5, x // 5]` if `x % 5 == 0**.
