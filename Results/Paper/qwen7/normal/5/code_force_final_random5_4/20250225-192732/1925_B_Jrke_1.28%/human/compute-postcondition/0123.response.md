Postcondition: `ans` is the maximum value among `ans`, 5, and `x // 5`, `i` is 5, `x` is an integer, `l` is a list containing `[ans, 5, 5]`, and `l.append(x // 5)` has been executed if `5 <= k`.

This means that after the if-else block executes, `ans` remains the maximum value among `ans`, 5, and `x // 5`, `i` is always 5, `x` is an integer, `l` is a list initially containing `[ans, 5, 5]`, and if `5 <= k`, the value of `x // 5` is appended to the list `l`.
