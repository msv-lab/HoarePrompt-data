Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` is the maximum value found during all iterations.
- `i` is the largest odd integer less than or equal to the square root of `x` after all iterations.
- `l` is a list containing `[ans, i, x // i]` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k` and `x % i == 0`.

The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the maximum value found during all iterations.

Output: **ans (where ans is the maximum value found during all iterations)**
