Output State: **`x` is an integer input from the first split, `n` is an integer input from the second split**.

Explanation: The code `x, n = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to `x` and `n` respectively. Since the exact values of the inputs are not specified, we only know that `x` and `n` are integers resulting from the split and conversion operation. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, which is effectively "can hold any values" in this context.
