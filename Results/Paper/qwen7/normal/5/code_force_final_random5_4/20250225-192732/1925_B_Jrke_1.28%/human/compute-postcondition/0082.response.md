Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `i` is 5 if `x` is odd, otherwise `i` is 6, `l` is a list containing the elements `ans`, `i`, and `i`**.

Explanation: The code snippet `l.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `l`. Given the initial state, `i` is either 5 (if `x` is odd) or 6 (if `x` is even). Since the condition `x % i == 0` was not met in the initial state (as `l` is only `[ans]`), `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, `i` is appended to the list `l`, making the list now contain `ans`, `i`, and `i`.
