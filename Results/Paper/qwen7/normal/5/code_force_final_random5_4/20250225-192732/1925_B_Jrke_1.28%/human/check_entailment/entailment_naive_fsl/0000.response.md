Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `x` is prime and greater than `n`. In such a scenario, the maximum balance should be 1 because the smallest possible divisor greater than 1 would be the smallest prime factor of `x`, which cannot be evenly divided among `n` sub-problems without resulting in a non-integer value. 

For example, consider the input `x = 7` and `n = 3`. The program would calculate `k = x // n = 2`, but since `k` is not 1, it proceeds to find the GCD. However, 7 is a prime number, and the only divisors are 1 and 7. Since 7 cannot be evenly divided into 3 parts, the maximum balance should be 1. The program, however, does not account for this scenario and might fail to produce the correct output.
