The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `t`.

Given that `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, and `i` is currently 1, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `t`. Since `i` starts at 1, it will increment by 1 each iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be 2 and `t` must still be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `i` is 2**
