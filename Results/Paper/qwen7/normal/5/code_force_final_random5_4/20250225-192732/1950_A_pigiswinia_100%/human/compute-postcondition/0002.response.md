Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial conditions for `t` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` must still be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, and `i` remains 0. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers entered by the user.
