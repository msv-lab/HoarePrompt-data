Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a value greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000.
- `i` is explicitly set to 1.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user and converted to integers.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('NONE')
```

This statement will print the string `'NONE'` regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Output: **NONE**
