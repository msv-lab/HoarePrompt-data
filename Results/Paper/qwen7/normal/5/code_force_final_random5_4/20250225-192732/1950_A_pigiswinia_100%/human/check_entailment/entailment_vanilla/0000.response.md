Let's reason through the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, it correctly reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. **Stair Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b < c`. If this condition is true, it prints "STAIR".
4. **Peak Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b > c`. If this condition is true, it prints "PEAK".
5. **Default Case**: If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints "NONE".

Now, let's verify that these checks cover all possible scenarios:

- **Stair Condition**: `a < b < c` is correctly checked.
- **Peak Condition**: `a < b > c` is correctly checked.
- **Neither Stair Nor Peak**: This is correctly handled by the `else` block, which prints "NONE".

Given the problem statement and the example inputs, the program appears to be correctly implementing the logic for determining whether the digits form a stair, a peak, or neither.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement and handles all possible cases.

**Correctness: **True**
