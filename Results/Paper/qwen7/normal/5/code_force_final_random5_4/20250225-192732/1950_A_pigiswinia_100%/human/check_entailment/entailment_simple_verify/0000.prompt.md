You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a value between 1 and 1000, `i` is 999 (since the loop runs from `i` in range(t) and `i` will reach `t-1`), `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user for each iteration of the loop. After all iterations, regardless of the conditions `a < b < c` or `a < b > c` being met or not, the values of `t` and `i` will be as described, and `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold the last set of values entered by the user before the loop terminates.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the conditions for checking if the digits form a stair or a peak are not properly implemented. The current implementation uses `a < b > c` which is incorrect because it does not check if `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`. Instead, it checks if `b` is greater than `a` but does not ensure that `b` is also greater than `c`.

A correct implementation should be:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < c < b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

This corrected version ensures that both conditions for a stair (`a < b < c`) and a peak (`a < c < b`) are properly checked.
