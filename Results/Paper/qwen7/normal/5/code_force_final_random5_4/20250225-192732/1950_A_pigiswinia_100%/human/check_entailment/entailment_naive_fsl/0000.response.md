Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the conditions for checking if the digits form a stair or a peak are not properly implemented. The current implementation uses `a < b > c` which is incorrect because it does not check if `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`. Instead, it checks if `b` is greater than `a` but does not ensure that `b` is also greater than `c`.

A correct implementation should be:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < c < b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

This corrected version ensures that both conditions for a stair (`a < b < c`) and a peak (`a < c < b`) are properly checked.
