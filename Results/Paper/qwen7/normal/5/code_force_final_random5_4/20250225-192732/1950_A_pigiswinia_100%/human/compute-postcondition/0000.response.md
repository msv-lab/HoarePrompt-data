Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, and `t` is now the integer input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, the value of `t` is updated to the integer input by the user, which must still fall within this range.
