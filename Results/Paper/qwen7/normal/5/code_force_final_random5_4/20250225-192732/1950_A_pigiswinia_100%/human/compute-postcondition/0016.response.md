Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input from the user and converts them to integers. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state. The conditions about `a`, `b`, and `c` being integers entered by the user are still valid, but now they are explicitly converted to integers.
