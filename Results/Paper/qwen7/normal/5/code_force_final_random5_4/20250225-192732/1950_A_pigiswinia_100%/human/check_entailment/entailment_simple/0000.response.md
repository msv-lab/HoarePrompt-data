Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It then iterates over each test case, reading three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` for each case.
3. For each set of digits, it checks if they form a stair (`a < b < c`) or a peak (`a < b > c`).
4. If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE".
5. The logic for checking the conditions is correct.
6. The program handles multiple test cases as specified.
7. The provided example input and output match the expected behavior of the program.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
