Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `num` is the next integer in the list `arr`, and `frequency_table[num]` is the frequency of `num` in the list `arr` incremented by 1, which is now equal to `k`.**

This means that the frequency of the number `num` in the list `arr` has been updated to `k` in the `frequency_table`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
