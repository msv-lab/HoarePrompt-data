You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        freq = func_1(nums, k)
        if k in freq.values():
            print(k - 1)
        else:
            print(n)

def func_1(arr, k):
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
        if frequency_table[num] > k:
            frequency_table[num] = k
    return frequency_table

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards, and k is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100.
def func_1(arr, k):
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
        
        if frequency_table[num] > k:
            frequency_table[num] = k
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `arr` is a non-empty list of integers, and for every integer `num` in `arr`, `frequency_table[num]` is the minimum value between the frequency of `num` in the list `arr` and the integer `k`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after running through all the elements in the list `arr`, the `frequency_table` will contain each unique number from `arr` with its count capped at `k`. If any number appears more than `k` times in `arr`, its count in `frequency_table` will be set to `k`.
    return frequency_table
    #The program returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is a unique integer from the list `arr` and its corresponding value is the minimum of the frequency of that integer in `arr` and the integer `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `k` (where 2 ≤ k ≤ 100). It processes `arr` to create a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is a unique integer from `arr` and its value is the minimum frequency of that integer in `arr` capped at `k`. After processing, the function returns this dictionary.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where multiple groups of `k` identical cards exist, and the goal is to minimize the total number of cards. Specifically, the function `func_1` is not correctly implemented to achieve the desired outcome.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5 3
4 1 1 4 4
```
According to the problem description, we can exchange groups of 3 identical cards for 2 new cards. The optimal strategy here would be to exchange the three 4's for 2 new cards, leaving us with 2 cards (one 1 and two new cards), resulting in a final count of 2 cards.

However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly reduce the number of cards in such scenarios. Instead, it caps the frequency of any number at `k`, which does not necessarily lead to the minimum number of cards.

To fix this, we need to ensure that we are reducing the number of cards by exchanging groups of `k` identical cards for `k-1` new cards, and we need to account for the fact that multiple exchanges can occur. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count the frequency of each number
    freq = {}
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    # Calculate the minimum number of cards
    min_cards = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        min_cards += (count + k - 1) // k * (k - 1)
    
    print(min_cards)
```

This corrected version correctly calculates the minimum number of cards by ensuring that we exchange groups of `k` identical cards for `k-1` new cards, and it handles multiple groups of `k` identical cards appropriately.
