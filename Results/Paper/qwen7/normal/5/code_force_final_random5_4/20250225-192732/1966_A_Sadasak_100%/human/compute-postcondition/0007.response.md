Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `num` is the next integer in the list `arr`, and `frequency_table[num]` is the frequency of `num` in the list `arr` incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the frequency of the integer `num` in the `frequency_table`. Initially, `frequency_table[num]` is either the current count of `num` (if it exists in the table) or 0 (if it does not exist). After executing the code, the frequency of `num` in the `frequency_table` is incremented by 1. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
