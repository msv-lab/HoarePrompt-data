Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `num` is the first element of `arr`, and `frequency_table[num]` is equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `frequency_table[num]` to `k`. The initial conditions of `arr` being a non-empty list of integers and `num` being the first element of `arr` remain unchanged. The frequency table entry for `num` is now set to `k`.
