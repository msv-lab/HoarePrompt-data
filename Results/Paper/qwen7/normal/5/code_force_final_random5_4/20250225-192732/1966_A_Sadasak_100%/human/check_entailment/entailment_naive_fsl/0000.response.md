Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where multiple groups of `k` identical cards exist, and the goal is to minimize the total number of cards. Specifically, the function `func_1` is not correctly implemented to achieve the desired outcome.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5 3
4 1 1 4 4
```
According to the problem description, we can exchange groups of 3 identical cards for 2 new cards. The optimal strategy here would be to exchange the three 4's for 2 new cards, leaving us with 2 cards (one 1 and two new cards), resulting in a final count of 2 cards.

However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly reduce the number of cards in such scenarios. Instead, it caps the frequency of any number at `k`, which does not necessarily lead to the minimum number of cards.

To fix this, we need to ensure that we are reducing the number of cards by exchanging groups of `k` identical cards for `k-1` new cards, and we need to account for the fact that multiple exchanges can occur. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count the frequency of each number
    freq = {}
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    # Calculate the minimum number of cards
    min_cards = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        min_cards += (count + k - 1) // k * (k - 1)
    
    print(min_cards)
```

This corrected version correctly calculates the minimum number of cards by ensuring that we exchange groups of `k` identical cards for `k-1` new cards, and it handles multiple groups of `k` identical cards appropriately.
