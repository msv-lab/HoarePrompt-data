### Reasoning:

The original assessment is largely accurate in identifying the flaws in the provided program. Let's break down the issues and verify the correct solution step by step.

#### Issues Identified in the Original Program:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Case:**
   - The edge case where `k > n` is handled correctly by printing `n`.

2. **Incorrect Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is unnecessary and does not contribute to solving the problem as intended. The frequency calculation should focus on determining how many groups of `k` cards can be formed and how many cards can be reduced.

3. **Flawed Logic for Determining Minimum Cards Left:**
   - The logic in the original program incorrectly assumes that the presence of `k` in the frequency dictionary implies a specific outcome. This is not always true, as the actual number of cards that can be reduced depends on the frequency of each number.

#### Correct Approach:

1. **Count Frequencies:**
   - Count the frequency of each number in the list of cards.

2. **Calculate Reductions:**
   - For each frequency, calculate how many cards can be reduced by performing the exchange operation. Specifically, for each group of `count` cards, we can reduce `(count // k) * (k - 1)` cards.

3. **Determine Minimum Cards Left:**
   - Subtract the total number of reducible cards from the initial number of cards to get the minimum number of cards left.

#### Correct Solution:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Count the frequency of each number
    freq = {}
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1

    # Calculate the minimum number of cards left
    min_cards_left = n
    for count in freq.values():
        min_cards_left -= count // k * (k - 1)

    print(min_cards_left)
```

### Detailed Explanation:

1. **Count Frequencies:**
   - We use a dictionary `freq` to count the occurrences of each number in the list `nums`.

2. **Calculate Reductions:**
   - For each frequency `count` in `freq`, we calculate the number of cards that can be reduced by performing the exchange operation. Specifically, `(count // k) * (k - 1)` gives the number of cards that can be reduced from a group of `count` cards.

3. **Determine Minimum Cards Left:**
   - We subtract the total number of reducible cards from the initial number of cards `n` to get the minimum number of cards left.

### Conclusion:

The original program is indeed incorrect due to the flawed logic in determining the minimum number of cards left. The correct approach involves counting the frequency of each number and then calculating the reduction in the number of cards based on the exchange operation.

**Final: False**

This conclusion aligns with the detailed analysis and the provided correct solution.
