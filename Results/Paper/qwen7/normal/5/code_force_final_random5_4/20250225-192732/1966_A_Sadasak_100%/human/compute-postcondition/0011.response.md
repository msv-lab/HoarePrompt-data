Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `num` is the next integer in the list `arr`, and `frequency_table[num]` is the frequency of `num` in the list `arr` incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the frequency of `num` in the `frequency_table`. It uses the `get` method of the dictionary to retrieve the current frequency of `num` (which is `frequency_table[num]`), defaulting to 0 if `num` is not already a key in the dictionary. Then, it increments this value by 1. Therefore, the frequency of `num` in the `frequency_table` is incremented by 1. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
