Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given code are `num` and `arr`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each integer `num` in the list `arr`. For each iteration, the frequency of `num` in the `frequency_table` is updated, but only if it does not exceed `k`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `arr` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `num` is the next integer in the list `arr`.
   - `frequency_table[num]` is the frequency of `num` in the list `arr` incremented by 1.
   - If `frequency_table[num]` is greater than `k`, then `frequency_table[num]` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop is about to start another iteration, `num` will be the next integer in the list `arr`.
   - The frequency of `num` in `frequency_table` will be incremented by 1.
   - If `frequency_table[num]` was already greater than `k`, it will remain unchanged.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `arr` will still be the same list, but `num` will be the next integer in the list.
   - `frequency_table[num]` will be incremented by 1, unless it was already greater than `k`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `arr` is a non-empty list of integers (remains the same).
- `num` is the next integer in the list `arr`.
- `frequency_table[num]` is the frequency of `num` in the list `arr` incremented by 1.

However, since we don't know the exact value of `num` or the updated frequency, we can only say that `num` will be the next element in the list and its frequency will be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `num` is the next integer in the list `arr`, and `frequency_table[num]` is the frequency of `num` in the list `arr` incremented by 1.**
