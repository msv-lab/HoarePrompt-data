Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function is intended to limit the frequency of each number to `k`, but it doesn't serve the purpose of finding the minimum number of cards left. Instead, it should be used to count the occurrences of each number and then determine how many full sets of `k` cards can be formed.

2. **Logic in Main Program**:
   - The logic for handling the case when `k > n` is incorrect. If `k > n`, it means we cannot perform any exchanges, so the result should be `n`.
   - The logic for checking if `k` is in the values of the frequency dictionary is flawed. It checks if `k` is present in the frequencies, which is not relevant to the problem. We need to find out how many full sets of `k` cards we can form and what remains.
   - The final check for `print(k - 1)` is also incorrect because it doesn't account for the remainder when dividing the counts by `k`.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Count the frequency of each number.
2. Determine how many full sets of `k` cards can be formed.
3. Calculate the remaining cards after forming these full sets.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    from collections import Counter
    
    # Count the frequency of each number
    freq = Counter(nums)
    
    # Calculate the total number of cards that can be exchanged
    total_exchanged = sum(freq[num] // k for num in freq)
    
    # The remaining cards will be the ones that couldn't form a full set of k
    remaining_cards = n - total_exchanged
    
    print(remaining_cards)
```

This version correctly calculates the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations.
