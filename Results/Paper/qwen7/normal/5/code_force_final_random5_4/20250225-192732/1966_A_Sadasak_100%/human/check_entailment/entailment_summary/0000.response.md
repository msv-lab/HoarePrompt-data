Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Base Case Handling**: If `k > n`, the program prints `n`. This is correct because if `k` is greater than the number of cards, no exchanges can be made, and thus the number of cards remains unchanged.

3. **Frequency Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each card number in the list `nums` but caps the frequency at `k`. However, the logic in `func_1` does not directly help in determining the minimum number of cards left. Instead, it seems to be an intermediate step that might be intended to be used in the main logic.

4. **Main Logic**: The main logic checks if `k` is present in the values of the dictionary returned by `func_1`. If `k` is present, it prints `k - 1`. Otherwise, it prints `n`. This logic is flawed because:
   - The presence of `k` in the values of the frequency table does not necessarily mean that we can reduce the number of cards to `k - 1`.
   - The logic should consider the total count of each card type and how many full exchanges (`k` cards) can be made, rather than just checking if `k` is a value in the frequency table.

5. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the first test case (5 3 4 1 1 4 4), the correct answer should be 2, but the program would incorrectly print 3 - 1 = 2.
   - For the second test case (1 10 7), the correct answer should be 1, but the program would print 1 directly without considering the exchange logic.
   - For the fourth test case (10 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1), the correct answer should be 3, but the program would print 4 - 1 = 3.

Given the flaws in the logic, especially the incorrect handling of the main algorithm to determine the minimum number of cards, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
