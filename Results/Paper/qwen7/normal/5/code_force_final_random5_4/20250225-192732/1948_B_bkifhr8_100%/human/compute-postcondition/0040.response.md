Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 50, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `ans` is False, `i` is 0, `m` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `m = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `m`. The other variables (`n`, `arr`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged. The new value of `m` is an integer obtained from the input.
