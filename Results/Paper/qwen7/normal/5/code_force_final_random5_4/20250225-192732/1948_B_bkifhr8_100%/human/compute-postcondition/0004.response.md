Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `ans` is True.**

The code simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `ans`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, or `arr`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions with `ans` being set to `True`.
