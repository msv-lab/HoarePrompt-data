Output State: **The initial state is not fully specified. However, `nums` is a list that contains elements converted from a string representation of `arr[i-1]` and an additional element from `arr[i]`.**

Given the initial state, let's assume `arr` is a list and `i` is an index within the range of `arr`. The code snippet converts each character of the string representation of `arr[i-1]` into an integer and appends it to the list `nums`, followed by appending `arr[i]` (which could be an integer or a string).

Since the exact values of `arr` and `i` are not provided, we can only describe the structure of `nums` based on the given code.

Output State: **`nums` is a list containing integers derived from the string representation of `arr[i-1]` followed by the element `arr[i]`.**
