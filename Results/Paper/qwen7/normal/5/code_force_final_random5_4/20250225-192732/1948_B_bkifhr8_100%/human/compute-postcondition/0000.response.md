Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50.**

The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to `n`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state and no operation was performed on it within the given code snippet.
