Output State: **`arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`, `nums` is a list of integers derived from the string representation of `arr[i - 1]` followed by the element `arr[i]`, `ans` is `False`, `i` is `i - 1`, and `m` remains the same, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the `break` statement has been executed, which would exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. However, none of the variables (`arr[i - 1]`, `nums`, `ans`, `i`, `m`) have been altered by the `break` statement itself. Therefore, their previous states remain unchanged.
