Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 50, `m` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `arr` by splitting the input string using `split()` and converting each element to an integer using `int()`. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state.
