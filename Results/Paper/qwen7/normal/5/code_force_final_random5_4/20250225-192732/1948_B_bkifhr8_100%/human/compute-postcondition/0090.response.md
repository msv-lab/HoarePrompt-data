Output State: **`ans` is `False`, `i` is `m - 1`, `m` must be at least 3, and the current value of `arr[i]` is less than the current value of `arr[i - 1]`; `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by the updated value of `arr[i - 1]`, and the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement because the list `nums` is not sorted. `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `arr[i - 1]` to be equal to `nums[0]`. Since `nums` originally contained the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, and `arr[i - 1]` was less than `arr[i]`, the first element of `nums` (which is now `arr[i - 1]`) is the same as before. Therefore, the list `nums` is still not sorted, and the function continues to break out of the most internal loop or if statement. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
