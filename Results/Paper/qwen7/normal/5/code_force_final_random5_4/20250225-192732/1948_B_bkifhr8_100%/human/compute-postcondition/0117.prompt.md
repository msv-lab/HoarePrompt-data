You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        ans = True
        
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is `False`, `i` is `0`, `m` is an integer such that `1 ≤ m ≤ n`, and `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input after all iterations of the loop have completed.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be decremented until it reaches 0. The loop continues to run for each value of `m` from `n` down to 1. If at any point during these iterations, the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is met and the concatenated number is not sorted, `ans` is set to `False` and the loop breaks. Given the provided conditions, `ans` remains `False` throughout all iterations unless the condition is never met, which is not specified in the problem statement. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will be 0, `ans` will be `False`, and `m` will be the smallest value it was set to during the loop, which is at least 1 and at most `n`. The value of `arr[i-1]` will be the first digit of the number formed by concatenating `arr[i-1]` and `arr[i]` if the condition was met, but since `ans` is `False`, this condition was not met for any `i`, so `arr[i-1]` retains its value from the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input through a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99), and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3 represents the number of such test cases. For each test case, it returns a result based on the processed input.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
