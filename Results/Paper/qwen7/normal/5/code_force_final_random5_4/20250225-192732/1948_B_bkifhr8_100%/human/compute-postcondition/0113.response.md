Output: **NO**

Explanation: 
- `ans` is explicitly given as `False`.
- `i` is explicitly given as `0`.
- `m` is stated to be "at least 3", but this value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- `arr[i-1]` is explicitly given as `nums[0]`, but this information is not required to determine the output either.

The print statement uses a list `['NO', 'YES'][ans]` where `ans` is `False`. In Python, `False` corresponds to the index `0` of the list, so it will print the first element of the list, which is `'NO'`.
