Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` is either `True` or `False`.
- `i` is set to `m - 1`.
- `m` must be greater than 1.
- `arr[i - 1]` is `nums[0]`.

The `print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])` statement will evaluate the boolean value of `ans` and print either "NO" or "YES" based on the value of `ans`.

If `ans` is `True`, the print statement will output "YES".
If `ans` is `False`, the print statement will output "NO".

Therefore, the output depends on the value of `ans`:

Output: **YES** if ans is True, **NO** if ans is False.
