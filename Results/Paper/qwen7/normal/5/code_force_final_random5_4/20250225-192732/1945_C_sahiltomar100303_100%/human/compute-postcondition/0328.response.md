Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `right` is equal to `n`
   - `tleftZero` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`
   - `trightOne` is equal to `(n - 1) // 2`

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for _ in range(t):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop uses `_` as an iterator, which is a placeholder and does not hold any state.
   - The loop does not directly modify `tleftZero`, `trightOne`, or `right`.

4. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will execute again if `t` (the number of iterations) is greater than 0.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop does not directly modify `tleftZero`, `trightOne`, or `right`, these states remain unchanged.
   - The only thing that changes is the value of `t` (the number of remaining iterations).

6. **New State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `t` is decremented by 1 from its previous value.

Given that `t` is the only variable that changes in the loop head, the new state at the start of the next iteration should reflect this change.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`right` is equal to `n`, `tleftZero` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is equal to `(n - 1) // 2`, `t` is `t - 1`**
