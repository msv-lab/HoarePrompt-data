Output State: **`leftZero` is reduced by 1 if the character at `s[left - 1]` is '0', `leftMove` remains 0, `left` is now `mid - 1`, `mid` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` is less than half of `mid + 1`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n - mid + 1`, and `leftOne` is decreased by 1, `rightOne` is increased by 1, and either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` must hold true for the next iteration.**

Explanation: The code `rightOne += 1` increases the value of `rightOne` by 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
