Output State: **`right` is less than `n`; `tleftZero` is increased by 1; either `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2`**

The code increments `tleftZero` by 1. The condition involving `tleftZero` remains valid since it's only updated here. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
