Output State: **`rightZero` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `i` is 0, `mid` must be greater than 0, and the character at index `i` of string `s` is not '0', `leftOne` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `leftOne` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `leftOne` was 0, after executing `leftOne += 1`, the value of `leftOne` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
