Output State: **`rightZero` is 3 or 4, `leftZero` is 1, `left` is 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `trightZero` is 1 or 2, `tleftOne` is 6 or 7, `trightOne` is 1 or 2, `leftOne` is 2, `right` is `mid` + 1, `n` must be less than or equal to 9, and `s[right]` is either '0' or not '0'**.

Explanation: The variable `right` is incremented by 1. Since `right` was originally equal to `mid`, after executing `right += 1`, the new value of `right` is `mid + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
