Output State: **`rightOne` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3; `rightZero` is either 1, 2; `leftZero` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive); `left` is 0; `leftMove` remains 0; `trightZero` is either 0 or 1; `tleftOne` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive); `trightOne` is either 0 or 1; `leftOne` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive); `right` is `n`; `mid` is `n // 2`; `i` is `n // 2 + 2**.

Explanation: The code `rightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. Since `rightZero` could initially be 0, 1, or 2, after incrementing, it will now be 1, 2, or 3. However, since the initial range for `rightZero` was 0 to 2, after incrementing, its new range will be 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
