Output State: **`rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `right` is equal to `n`, `tleftZero` is 0, `trightOne` is equal to `(n - 1) // 2`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0.**

The code `tleftZero = 0` sets the variable `tleftZero` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
