Output State: **`left` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` is now (`leftZero` - 1), `rightOne` must be less than (n - left + 1) // 2, `rightZero` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `rightZero` is incremented by 1. The conditions and values of `left`, `leftZero`, and `rightOne` remain unchanged from their initial state.
