Output State: **`left` is greater than -1, `rightZero` is increased by 1 if the character at index `left` in the string `s` was '0', otherwise `rightOne` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `left -= 1` decrements the value of `left` by 1. Since `left` was initially greater than 0, after decrementing, `left` is now greater than -1. The conditions for increasing `rightZero` or `rightOne` remain unchanged and depend on the character at the new index `left` in the string `s`.
