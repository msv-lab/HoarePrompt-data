Postcondition: `rightZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightOne`, `left`, and `leftMove` are as follows: if `s[left - 1]` is '0', then `rightZero` is 4, `trightZero` remains 3, `tleftOne` remains 6, `trightOne` remains 2, `left` is greater than 4, and `leftMove` remains 0. If `s[left - 1]` is not '0', then `rightZero` remains 3, `trightZero` remains 3, `tleftOne` becomes 5, `trightOne` becomes 3, `left` is greater than 4, and `leftMove` remains 0.
