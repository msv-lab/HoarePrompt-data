Output State: **`rightZero` is 0, `right` is equal to `n`, `tleftZero` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is equal to `(n - 1) // 2`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 0.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value 0 to the variable `rightZero`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
