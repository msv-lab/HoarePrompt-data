Output State: **`rightZero` retains its initial value, `trightZero` retains its initial value, `tleftOne` retains its initial value, `trightOne` retains its initial value, `mid` retains its initial value, `i` is `i + 1` and must be less than `mid`, `leftZero` is `leftZero + 1`, `tleftZero` is `tleftZero + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `tleftZero += 1` increments the value of `tleftZero` by 1. All other variables (`rightZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightOne`, `mid`, `i`, and `leftZero`) retain their initial values.
