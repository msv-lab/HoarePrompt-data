Output State: `right` is equal to `n`, `tleftZero` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, and `trightOne` is equal to `(n - 1) // 2`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the condition `right < n` will no longer be true because `right` will have reached `n`. The loop increments `right` until it reaches `n`, so `right` will be exactly `n`. At this point, `tleftZero` will be adjusted to `(n + 1) // 2` because it increases by 1 each time `s[right]` is '0'. Similarly, `trightOne` will be adjusted to `(n - 1) // 2` as it decreases by 1 each time `s[right]` is '1'. The other variables (`left`, `leftZero`, `leftOne`) will remain in their final states as determined by the loop's execution.
