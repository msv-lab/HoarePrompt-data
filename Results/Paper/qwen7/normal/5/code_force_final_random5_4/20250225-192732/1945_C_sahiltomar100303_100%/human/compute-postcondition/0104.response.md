Output State: **`rightZero` is 4, `leftZero` is 1, `left` is 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `trightZero` is 2, `tleftOne` remains 6, `trightOne` is 2, `leftOne` is 2, `right` is `mid`, `n` is greater than 9, and `s[right]` is either '0' or not '0'.**

Explanation: The variable `right` is incremented by 1. Initially, `right` was equal to `mid`. After the increment, `right` now equals `mid + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
