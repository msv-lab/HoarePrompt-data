Output State: `right` is equal to `n`, `tleftZero` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, and `trightOne` is equal to `(n - 1) // 2`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the condition `right < n` will no longer be true because `right` will have reached `n`. The loop will terminate when `right` equals `n`. By the end of the loop, `tleftZero` will be adjusted to `(n + 1) // 2` and `trightOne` will be adjusted to `(n - 1) // 2` based on the conditions inside the loop.
