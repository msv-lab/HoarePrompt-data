Output State: **`rightOne` is 1, `rightZero` is 0, `leftZero` is between 0 and n (inclusive), `left` is 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is between 0 and n (inclusive), `trightOne` is 0, `leftOne` is between 0 and n (inclusive), `right` is `n`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `tleftZero` is between 0 and n (inclusive), and `s[i]` is not equal to '0'**.

Explanation: The code `rightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. Since `rightOne` was initially 0, after executing this line, its value becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
