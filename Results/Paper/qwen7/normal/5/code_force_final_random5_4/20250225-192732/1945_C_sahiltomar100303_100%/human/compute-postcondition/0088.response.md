Postcondition: `rightZero`, `leftZero`, `left`, `leftMove`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightOne`, and `leftOne` remain as specified in the precondition. If `s[left - 1] == '0'`, then `rightZero` becomes 4, and `leftZero` becomes either `left - 4` or `left - 3`. Otherwise, `rightZero` remains 3, and `leftZero` remains either `left - 3` or `left - 2`. Both `leftZero` is at least `(left + 1) // 2` and `rightOne` is at least `(n - left + 1) // 2` hold true after the execution.
