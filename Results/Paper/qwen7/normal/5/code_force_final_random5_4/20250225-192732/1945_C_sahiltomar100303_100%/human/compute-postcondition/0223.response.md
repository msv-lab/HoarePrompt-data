Output State: **`rightOne` is between 0 and `n`, `rightZero` is between 0 and `n`, `leftZero` is between 0 and `n`, `left` is `n // 2`, `leftMove` remains 0, `trightZero` is between 0 and `n`, `tleftOne` is between 0 and `n`, `trightOne` is between 0 and `n`, `leftOne` is between 0 and `n`, `right` is `n`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `tleftZero` is between 0 and `n`.**

Explanation: The variable `left` is assigned the value of `mid`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `left` is now `n // 2`, while all other variables (`rightOne`, `rightZero`, `leftZero`, `left`, `leftMove`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightOne`, `leftOne`, `right`, `mid`, `tleftZero`) retain their original values.
