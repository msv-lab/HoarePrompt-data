Output State: **`s` is a string, `i` is an index within `s` such that `i < n`, `rightZero` is unchanged, `rightOne` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `rightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. Since `rightZero` is only incremented when the character at index `i` in `s` is '0', and no such condition was met here, `rightZero` remains unchanged. All other variables retain their initial conditions.
