Output State: **t is an input integer, 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and a is a string of length n consisting only of '0' and '1'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The constraints for `t` are preserved, and the other variables (`n` and `a`) remain in their initial state as per the precondition.
