Output State: **`rightZero` is 3, `leftZero` is 1, `left` is 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `trightZero` is 1, `tleftOne` remains 6, `trightOne` is 2, `leftOne` is 2, `right` is `mid`, `n` must be less than or equal to 9, `tleftZero` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `trightZero -= 1` decreases the value of `trightZero` by 1. Initially, `trightZero` is 2. After executing the code, `trightZero` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Additionally, it is mentioned that `tleftZero` is increased by 1, which is also reflected in the output state.
