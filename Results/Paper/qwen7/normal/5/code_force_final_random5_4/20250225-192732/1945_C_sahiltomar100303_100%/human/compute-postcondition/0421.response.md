Output State: `leftZero` is reduced to a value that is less than or equal to half of `left + 1`, `leftMove` remains 0, `i` is `n-1`, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros from index `mid` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is the total number of ones from index `mid` to `n-1`, `left` is now `0` (since `left` starts from `mid` and decreases by 1 each iteration until it reaches 0), `mid` is 0 (as `left` reaches 0, indicating the loop has ended), and `rightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n - mid + 1`.

This final state occurs because the loop continues to decrement `left` and adjust `leftZero` and `rightOne` based on the characters in the string `s` until `left` reaches 0, which means the condition `left > 0` no longer holds true, and the loop terminates.
