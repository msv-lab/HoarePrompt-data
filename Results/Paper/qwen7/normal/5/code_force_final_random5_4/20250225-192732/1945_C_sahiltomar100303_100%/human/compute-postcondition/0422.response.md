Output State: **`leftZero` is reduced to a value that is less than or equal to half of `left + 1`, `leftMove` remains 0, `i` is `n-1`, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros from index `mid` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is the total number of ones from index `mid` to `n-1`, `left` is now `0` (since `left` starts from `mid` and decreases by 1 each iteration until it reaches 0), `mid` is 0 (as `left` reaches 0, indicating the loop has ended), `rightOne` is less than or equal to half of `n - mid + 1`, and `right` is set to `mid`.**

Explanation: The code `right = mid` simply assigns the value of `mid` to the variable `right`. Since `mid` is currently 0, `right` is also set to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
