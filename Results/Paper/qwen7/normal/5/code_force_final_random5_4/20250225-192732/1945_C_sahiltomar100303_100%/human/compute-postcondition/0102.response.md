Output State: **`rightZero` is 4, `leftZero` is 1, `left` is 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `trightZero` remains 3, `tleftOne` remains 6, `trightOne` is 2, `leftOne` is 2, `right` is `mid`, `n` is greater than 9, `s[right]` is not '0', `tleftOne` is 7**

Explanation: The code `trightOne -= 1` decrements the value of `trightOne` by 1. Initially, `trightOne` is 3, so after executing the code, `trightOne` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
