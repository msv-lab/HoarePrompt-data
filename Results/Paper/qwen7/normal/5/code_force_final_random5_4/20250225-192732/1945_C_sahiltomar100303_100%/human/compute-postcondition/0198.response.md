Output State: `rightOne` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `leftZero` is a value between 0 and `mid`, `left` is 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is a value between 0 and `mid`, `trightOne` is 0, `leftOne` is a value between 0 and `mid`, `right` is `n`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `tleftZero` is a value between 0 and `mid`, `i` is `mid`, `mid` must be greater than 0.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations (from `i = 0` to `i = mid - 1`), the variable `i` will be equal to `mid`. The loop modifies `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `tleftZero`, and `tleftOne` based on the characters in the string `s` up to index `mid - 1`. Since `mid` is `n // 2`, the final values of `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `tleftZero`, and `tleftOne` will depend on how many '0's and '1's are present in the first half of the string `s`. The other variables (`rightOne`, `rightZero`, `right`, `mid`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, `leftMove`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their last updated state before the loop ends.
