Based on the initial state provided:

- `rightZero` is 0
- `leftZero` is 1
- `left` is 0
- `leftMove` remains 0
- `trightZero` is 0
- `tleftOne` is 8
- `trightOne` is 0
- `leftOne` is 2
- The current value of `right` is `n`
- `left` is not 0

The variable `left` is explicitly stated to have a value of 0 in the initial state. However, it is also mentioned that `left` is not 0. This contradiction suggests that there might be an error in the initial state description since `left` cannot simultaneously be 0 and not 0. Given the problem's context and the need to adhere strictly to the provided information, we should consider the most precise description based on the given conditions.

Since the `print(left)` statement directly outputs the value of the `left` variable, and the initial state explicitly states that `left` is 0, despite the condition that `left` is not 0, we must prioritize the explicit value given.

Output: **0**
