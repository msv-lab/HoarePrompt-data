Output State: **`right` is equal to `n`, `tleftZero` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is equal to `(n - 1) // 2`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `mid` is `n // 2`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `n // 2` to the variable `mid`. This does not affect the values of `right`, `tleftZero`, `trightOne`, `t`, `n`, or `s`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial values from the initial state.
