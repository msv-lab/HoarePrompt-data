Output State: **`leftMove` is 0, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `rightZero` will be equal to the total number of zeros from index `mid` to `n-1`, and `rightOne` will be equal to the total number of ones from index `mid` to `n-1`; `left` is set to `mid`.**

Explanation: The line `leftMove = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `leftMove`. This assignment does not affect the values of `i`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, and `left`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous states.
