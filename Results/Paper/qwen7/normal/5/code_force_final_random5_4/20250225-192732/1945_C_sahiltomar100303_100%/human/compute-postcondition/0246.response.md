Output State: **`left` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` is now (`leftZero` - 1), `rightOne` must be less than (n - left + 1) // 2.**

Explanation: The value of `leftZero` is decremented by 1. The conditions involving `leftZero` and `rightOne` remain valid, but the exact value of `leftZero` changes to `leftZero - 1`. The condition involving `rightOne` remains unchanged because `left` is not modified.
