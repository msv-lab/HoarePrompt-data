Postcondition: `rightZero` is 3, `leftZero` is either `left - 2` or `left - 1`, `left` is `left - 1`, `leftMove` remains 0, `trightZero` remains 3, `tleftOne` remains 6, `trightOne` is either 3 or `trightOne - 13`, `leftOne` is either 5 or `leftOne - 13`, and both `leftZero` is at least `(left + 1) // 2` and `rightOne` is at least `(n - left + 1) // 2`.
