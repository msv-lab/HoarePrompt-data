Output State: **`rightZero` is 3, `leftZero` is either `left - 3` or `left - 2`, `left` must be greater than 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `trightZero` remains 3, `tleftOne` remains 6, `trightOne` is either 3 or `trightOne - 13`, `leftOne` is `leftOne - 1`, and both `leftZero` is at least `(left + 1) // 2` and `rightOne` is at least `(n - left + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code `leftOne -= 1` decreases the value of `leftOne` by 1. Since `leftOne` was either 5 or `leftOne - 13`, after decrementing, `leftOne` will now be `leftOne - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
