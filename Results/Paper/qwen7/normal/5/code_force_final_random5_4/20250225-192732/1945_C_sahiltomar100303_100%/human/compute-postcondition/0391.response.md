Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `rightZero` will be equal to the total number of zeros from index `mid` to `n-1`, and `rightOne` will be equal to the total number of ones from index `mid` to `n-1`.

Explanation: The loop starts from `i = mid` and continues until `i = n-1`. For each iteration, if the character at index `i` in string `s` is '0', `rightZero` is incremented; otherwise, `rightOne` is incremented. Since the loop runs from `mid` to `n-1`, `i` will end up being `n-1` after all iterations. The values of `rightZero` and `rightOne` will reflect the count of zeros and ones in the substring of `s` starting from `mid` to the end of the string.
