Postcondition: **`rightZero` is either 4 or 3, `leftZero` is either `left - 4`, `left - 3`, or `left - 2`, `left` must be greater than 0, `leftMove` remains 0, `trightZero` remains 3, `tleftOne` remains 6, `trightOne` is either 3 or `trightOne - 13`, `leftOne` is either `leftOne - 13` or `leftOne - 13 - 1`, and both `leftZero` is at least `(left + 1) // 2` and `rightOne` is at least `(n - left + 1) // 2`.**
