Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**: The postcondition mentions that `rightZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightOne`, `i`, and `mid` retain their initial values. This means these variables are unchanged from their starting values.

2. **Loop Condition**: The for loop iterates over the range `range(mid)`. This means the loop will execute `mid` times.

3. **Loop Body**: The loop body is omitted, but we know that if the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is incremented by 1 and `tleftZero` is also incremented by 1. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is not '0', then `tleftOne` is incremented by 1.

4. **State at the End of Previous Iteration**: The states at the end of the previous iteration are as follows:
   - `rightZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightOne`, `i`, and `mid` retain their initial values.
   - If the character at index `i` of string `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is incremented by 1 and `tleftZero` is also incremented by 1.
   - If the character at index `i` of string `s` is not '0', then `tleftOne` is incremented by 1.

5. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Since the loop iterates over `range(mid)`, `i` will be incremented until it reaches `mid`.

Given the above points, let's determine the states at the start of the next iteration:

- `i` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.
- `mid` remains unchanged.
- `rightZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightOne` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`rightZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightOne`, `i` is incremented by 1, `mid` retains its initial value**.
