Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `j` and `eta_ln`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - `j` starts from `1` and goes up to `eta_ln - 1`.
   - `eta_ln` is the length of the list `eta`, and it is given that `eta_ln` is not equal to `1`.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `j` starts from `1`, `j` must be at least `1` for the loop to start executing.
   - `eta_ln` must be greater than `1` as per the given condition.

4. **Consider the initial state of other variables**:
   - `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`.
   - `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, which contains all integers `j` from `0` to `n` for which `q[j]` was initially greater than `0`.
   - `q[j]` has been decremented by `1` for each such `j` encountered during the loop execution.
   - `res` is the value of `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6`.

Since these variables are not directly involved in the loop head conditions, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` and `eta_ln`.

**State:**
**`j` is 1, `eta_ln` is greater than 1**
