Output State: **`res` is increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, `eta[j]` remains unchanged, `q` remains unchanged, `rho` is increased by `2 * q[eta[j]]`, and `j` is `eta_ln`.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or block of code. In this case, it exits the loop or block where the given code snippet is located. The values of `res`, `eta[j]`, `q`, and `j` remain unchanged after the `break` statement. However, the value of `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]]` twice, which means it is increased by `2 * q[eta[j]]`.
