Output State: **`n` is 1 or 2, `j` is `n + 1`, `res` is the original value of `res` plus `q[eta[n]] * (q[eta[n]] - 1) * (q[eta[n]] - 2) // 6` plus `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` plus `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, `rho` is increased by `2 * q[eta[j]]`, `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]]`**

Explanation: The code `rho += q[eta[j]]` increases the value of `rho` by `q[eta[j]]`. Since `j` is `n + 1`, `q[eta[j]]` is the same as `q[eta[n + 1]]`. The value of `rho` is increased by `2 * q[eta[j]]` from the previous state and then by an additional `q[eta[j]]`, making the total increase `3 * q[eta[j]]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
