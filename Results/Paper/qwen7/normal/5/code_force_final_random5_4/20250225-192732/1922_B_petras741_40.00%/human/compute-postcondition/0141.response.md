Output State: The variable `q` will contain counts of each element in the list `w`. Specifically, `q[w[j]]` will be incremented for each `j` in the range of `n`, where `n` is the length of the list `w`.

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations (i.e., for each `j` in the range of `n`), the variable `q` will hold the count of how many times each index appears in the list `w`. For example, if `w` is `[1, 2, 1, 3, 2]` and `n` is 5, then `q` will be `[0, 2, 2, 1]` because `w[0]` (which is 1) appears twice, `w[1]` (which is 2) also appears twice, and `w[2]` (which is 3) appears once. All other indices in `q` (from 4 onwards) will be zero since they do not appear in `w`.
