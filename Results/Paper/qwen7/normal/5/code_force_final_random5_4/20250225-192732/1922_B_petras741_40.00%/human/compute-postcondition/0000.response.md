Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the value of `t` is updated to the input integer within this range. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
