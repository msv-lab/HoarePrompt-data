Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `j` and the condition `range(1, eta_ln)`. Therefore, the variables that can be adjusted are `j` and `eta_ln`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values at the Start of the Loop**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `n + 1`.
   - `eta_ln` is not explicitly mentioned as being modified within the loop, so it retains its initial value.

3. **Calculate the New Value of `j`**:
   - Since `j` starts from `n + 1` and the loop increments `j` by 1 each iteration, the new value of `j` will be `n + 2`.

4. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `j < eta_ln`.
   - Given that `j` is initially `n + 1` and the loop continues until `j` reaches `eta_ln`, the loop will execute again if `n + 2 < eta_ln`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` will be updated to `n + 2`.
   - `eta_ln` remains unchanged unless it is modified within the loop body, but since it is not mentioned as being modified, it stays the same.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `j` is updated to `n + 2`.
- `eta_ln` remains unchanged.

Given the postconditions and the loop structure, the states at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` is 1 or 2, `j` is `n + 2`, `res` is the original value of `res` plus `q[eta[n]] * (q[eta[n]] - 1) * (q[eta[n]] - 2) // 6` plus `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` plus `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, `rho` is increased by `3 * q[eta[j]]`, `eta_ln` is unchanged**.
