Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `j` and the constant `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `j` and `n`**: According to the problem statement, `j` will be equal to `n` at the start of the loop.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range from 0 to `n`. This means `j` will take values from 0 up to `n` inclusive.

4. **Check the initial state of `eta`**: The problem states that `eta` is an empty list. This does not affect the loop execution directly, but it is part of the overall program state.

5. **Adjust the state for the loop to execute**: For the loop to execute, `n` must be a non-negative integer because the range function in Python requires the upper limit to be a non-negative integer. Also, `j` should start at 0 and increment until it reaches `n`.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that `n` is a non-negative integer and `j` is set to `n`.

**Final State Adjustment**:
State: **`eta` is an empty list, `j` is `n`, `n` must be a non-negative integer**

This ensures that the loop can start executing with `j` initialized to `n` and the loop will run as expected.
