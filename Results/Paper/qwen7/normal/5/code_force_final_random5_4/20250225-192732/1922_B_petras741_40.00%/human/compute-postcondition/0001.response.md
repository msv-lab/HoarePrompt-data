Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `buffer` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `buffer`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it. Therefore, `t` is still an input integer within the specified range, and `buffer` is now an empty list.
