Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `q[1]` is greater than 0, `eta` contains [1], and `eta` now has one element.**

Explanation: The code `eta.append(j)` appends the value of `j` (which is 1) to the list `eta`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `eta` now contains the value `[1]`.
