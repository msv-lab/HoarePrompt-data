Output State: **`j` is 2; `q[w[2]]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value of `q[w[j]]` by 1. Since `j` is initially 2, the code effectively increments `q[w[2]]` by 1. No other variables are affected, so `j` remains 2. The exact value of `q[w[2]]` is not specified in the initial state, so we only know that it has been incremented by 1.
