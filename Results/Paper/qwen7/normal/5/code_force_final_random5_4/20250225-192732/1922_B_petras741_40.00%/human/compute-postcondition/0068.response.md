Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `buffer` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces
- `i` is 0
- `n` is an input integer

### Loop Condition
The loop condition is `for i in range(t)`. This means the loop will run `t` times.

### Adjusting States for the Next Iteration
At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 0 (since it starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration)

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
- The value of `n` does not change based on the loop itself; it remains as it was at the start of the loop.

### Updated State
- `t` remains the same as it was at the start of the loop
- `buffer` remains the same as it was at the start of the loop
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 1
- `n` remains the same as it was at the start of the loop

### Final Answer
State: **`t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `buffer` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer**
