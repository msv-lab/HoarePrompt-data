Output State: **`j` is 0; `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value of `q[w[j]]` by 1. Since `j` is initially 0, `w[j]` refers to `w[0]`. However, the initial state does not provide the value of `w`, so we can only say that `q[w[0]]` is incremented by 1. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
