Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop is defined as `for j in range(n)`. The only variable in the loop head is `j`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 1.
   - `q[w[1]]` is 2 (though this variable is not part of the loop head).

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented to 2 (because `range(n)` includes values from 0 to `n-1`).
   - The value of `q[w[1]]` is not part of the loop head and does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`j` is 2**
