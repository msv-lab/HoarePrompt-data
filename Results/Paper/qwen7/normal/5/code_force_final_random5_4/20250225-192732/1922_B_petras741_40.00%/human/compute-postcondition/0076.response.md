Output State: **`j` is 1; `q[w[1]]` is incremented by 1, so `q[w[1]]` is now 2**

Explanation: The code `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value of `q[w[j]]` by 1. Given the initial state where `j` is 1 and `q[w[1]]` is incremented by 1, the value of `q[w[1]]` was initially 1 (since it was incremented by 1). After running the code, `q[w[1]]` is incremented again, making its value 2. The value of `j` remains unchanged.
