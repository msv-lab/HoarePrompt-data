Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `eta` will contain all integers `j` from `0` to `n` (inclusive) for which `q[j]` was initially greater than `0`, and `q[j]` will be decremented by `1` for each such `j` encountered during the loop execution.**

This means that `eta` will include every integer `j` where `q[j]` was positive at the start, and `q[j]` will have been decremented by the number of times `j` was added to `eta`. The variable `n` will remain unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
