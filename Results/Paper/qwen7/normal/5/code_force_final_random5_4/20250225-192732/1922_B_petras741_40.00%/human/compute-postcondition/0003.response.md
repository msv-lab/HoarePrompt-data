Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `buffer` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial values of `t`, `buffer`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `n` is specifically the integer input provided by the user.
