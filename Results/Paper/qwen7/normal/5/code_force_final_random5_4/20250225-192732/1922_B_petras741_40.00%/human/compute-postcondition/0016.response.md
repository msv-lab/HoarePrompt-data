Output State: The list `q` will have its elements incremented based on the values in the list `w` for each iteration of the loop. Specifically, for each `j` in the range of `n`, the value at index `w[j]` in the list `q` will be incremented by 1. After all iterations of the loop, each element in `q` will reflect how many times the corresponding index appears in the list `w`.

In simpler terms, the final state of `q` will show the count of each integer present in the list `w`.
