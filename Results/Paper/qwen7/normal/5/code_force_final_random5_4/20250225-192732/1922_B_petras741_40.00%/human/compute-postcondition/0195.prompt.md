Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `buffer` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]
    if n >= 3:
        q = {}
        q = [(0) for j in range(n + 1)]
        for j in range(n):
            q[w[j]] += 1
        eta = []
        for j in range(n + 1):
            if q[j] > 0:
                eta.append(j)
        eta_ln = len(eta)
        rho = q[eta[0]]
        if eta_ln == 1:
            print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
        else:
            res = q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6
            for j in range(1, eta_ln):
                res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
                res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
                rho += q[eta[j]]
                if j > 1000:
                    break
            print(res)
    else:
        print(0)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `buffer` is now a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, which contains all integers `j` from `0` to `n` for which `q[j]` was initially greater than `0`, and `q[j]` has been decremented by `1` for each such `j` encountered during the loop execution. If `eta_ln` equals `1`, `rho` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `res` accumulates contributions from each `j` from `1` to `eta_ln-1`, where each term in the summation depends on the value of `q[eta[j]]` and `rho`. Additionally, `rho` is increased by the sum of `q[eta[j]]` for each `j` from `1` to `eta_ln-1`. If `n` is less than 3, `t` remains an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `buffer` is now a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `i` is 0, and `n` is less than 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `buffer` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers from another input split by spaces, `eta_ln` is 3, `j` is `n`, `eta` contains the values 0, 1, and 2, `rho` is 0. If `n` is 3 or more, `j` is `n`, `res` is updated to the original value of `res` plus the specified summations, and `rho` is updated accordingly. If `n` is 1 or 2, `j` becomes `eta_ln`, `res` is updated to the original value of `res` plus the specified summations, and `rho` is updated accordingly. If `j` exceeds 1000, the loops or if statements are exited. If `n` is less than 3, `t` remains the same, `buffer` remains unchanged, `i` remains 1, `n` remains the same, and `w` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `eta` is an empty list, `j` is greater than 1000, `rho` is the sum of `q[0]` and the first 1001 elements of `q` (i.e., `sum(q[1:1002])`), and `res` is the cumulative sum of the expressions evaluated for each `j` from 1 to 1001 if `n` is greater than or equal to 3. Otherwise, `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `buffer` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer less than 3, `w` is a list of integers from another input split by spaces, `eta_ln` is 3, `j` is `n`, `eta` contains the values 0, 1, and 2, `rho` is 0, `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, and `w` is updated to a list of integers from the new input split by spaces.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
