Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `j` and `eta_ln`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `eta_ln` (exclusive), meaning `j` should be less than `eta_ln` for the loop to continue.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `eta` is an empty list.
   - `j` is greater than 1000.
   - `rho` is `q[0] + q[eta[j]]`.
   - `res` is `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * q[0]`.
   - The most internal loop or if statement is exited.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `j` is greater than 1000, it means `j` was at least 1001 at the end of the previous iteration.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `j + 1`.
   - The value of `eta_ln` remains unchanged as no information suggests it has been modified.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` will be `j + 1`, so if `j` was 1001, it will now be 1002.
   - `eta_ln` remains the same.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`eta` is an empty list, `j` is 1002, `rho` is `q[0] + q[eta[j]]`, `res` is `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * q[0]`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
