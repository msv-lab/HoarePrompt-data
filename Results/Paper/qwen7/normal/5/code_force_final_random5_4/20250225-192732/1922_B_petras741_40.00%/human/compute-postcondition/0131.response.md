Output State: **`t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `buffer` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers from another input split by spaces, `eta_ln` is 3, `j` is `n`, `eta` contains the values 0, 1, and 2, `rho` is 0, `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the next input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
