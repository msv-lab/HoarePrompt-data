Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the variable `j` and the condition `range(n + 1)`.
2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `q[j]` is greater than 0, and `eta` contains the value 0.
3. **Determine the next state for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.
   - Since `j` starts at 0 and the loop runs up to `n`, the next value of `j` would be 1.
   - The condition `q[j] > 0` must still hold true for `j = 1`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is a constant for the loop.
   - The value of `eta` remains 0 as there is no indication that it changes within the loop.

Based on these points, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- `j` should be updated to 1.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `q[j]` (which is now `q[1]`) must still be greater than 0.
- `eta` remains 0.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`j` is 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `q[1]` is greater than 0, and `eta` contains the value 0**.
