Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `eta` is an empty list, `q` reflects the count of each integer present in the list `w`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n + 1):
    if q[j] > 0:
        eta.append(j)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `q[j]` is an integer in the list `q`; if `q[j]` is greater than 0, then `eta` contains the integer `j`. There is no change to `q[j]` or `eta` if the condition `q[j] > 0` is not met.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `q[j]` is an integer in the list `q`; if `q[j]` is greater than 0, then `eta` contains the integer `j` and `j` is incremented to `k + 1`; `n` remains the same; if the condition `q[j] > 0` is not met, `eta` and `j` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `q[j]` is an integer in the list `q`. If `q[j] > 0`, `eta` now contains the integer `j` plus the value of `j` from the last iteration, `j` is incremented to `k + 1`, otherwise `j` remains the same. `n` remains the same.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
