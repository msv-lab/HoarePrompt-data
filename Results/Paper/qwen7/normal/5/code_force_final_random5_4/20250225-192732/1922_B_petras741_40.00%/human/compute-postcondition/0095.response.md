Output State: **`eta_ln` is 3, `j` is `n`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `q[j]` is 0, and `eta` contains the values 0, 1, and 2.**

Explanation: The line `eta_ln = len(eta)` calculates the length of the list `eta` and assigns it to the variable `eta_ln`. Since `eta` contains the values 0, 1, and 2, its length is 3. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
