Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `eta` is an empty list.
   - `j` is `n`.
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `n` (inclusive), meaning `j` starts at `0` and goes up to `n`.

3. **Current Iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is equal to `n`.

4. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will become `n + 1`.

5. **State Adjustment**: Since `j` is the only variable in the loop head that changes, and it will now be `n + 1`, we need to update the state accordingly.

6. **Postcondition**: The postcondition does not change regardless of the condition inside the loop body, as there is no `else` part and the postcondition is only checked if `q[j]` is greater than 0, which is not relevant here since `j` is `n` and `n` is a non-negative integer.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `eta` remains an empty list.
- `j` becomes `n + 1`.
- `n` remains a non-negative integer.

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`eta` is an empty list, `j` is `n + 1`, `n` is a non-negative integer**
