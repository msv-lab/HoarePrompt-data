Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `cnt1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `s`, and `cnt1`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 1 is still valid. The value of `n` is now an integer obtained from the user's input.
