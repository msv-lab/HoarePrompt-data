Output State: **start and end are integers such that start <= end, t is an input integer.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial conditions that `start` and `end` are integers and `start <= end` remain unchanged. The value of `t` is specifically an integer input from the user.
