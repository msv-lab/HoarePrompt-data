Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is a new input integer.
- `s` is a new string input by the user.
- `cnt1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`.

The `print('YES')` statement simply prints the string 'YES'. Since no values for `t`, `n`, or `s` are needed to determine the output of this print statement, the output is straightforward.

Output: **YES**
