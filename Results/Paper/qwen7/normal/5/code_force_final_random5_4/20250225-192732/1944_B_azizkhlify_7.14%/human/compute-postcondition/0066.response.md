Postcondition: `i` is `n-2`, `re` is incremented by 1, `res` contains `a[i]`, and `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1. If `re` equals `k`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `re` does not equal `k`, then `i` remains `n-2`, `re` and `res` retain their original values, and `l[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged.
