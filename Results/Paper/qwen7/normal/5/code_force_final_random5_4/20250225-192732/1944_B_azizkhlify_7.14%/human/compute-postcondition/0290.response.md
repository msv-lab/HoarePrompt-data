Given the initial state where `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer, but no information about `a` is provided, we need to consider the value of `a[i]`. Since `i` is 1, we are looking at `a[1]`.

However, the value of `a[1]` is not explicitly given. Therefore, we can only describe it in terms of the list `a`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

This will print the value of `a[1]` twice, followed by a space (due to the `end=' '` parameter).

Output: **a[1] a[1]**
