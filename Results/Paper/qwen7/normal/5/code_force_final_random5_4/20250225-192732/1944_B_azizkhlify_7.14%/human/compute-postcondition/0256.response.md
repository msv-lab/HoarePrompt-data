Output State: **`n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The initial values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
