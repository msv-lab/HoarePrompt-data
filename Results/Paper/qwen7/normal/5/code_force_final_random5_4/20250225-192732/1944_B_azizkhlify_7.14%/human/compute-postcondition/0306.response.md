Output State: **`k` is `2 * k - ul`, `i` is `2 * n`, each element at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `r` has been incremented by `n`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `k` to `2 * k - ul`. The values of `i` and the elements in list `r` remain unchanged from their initial states after the loop.
