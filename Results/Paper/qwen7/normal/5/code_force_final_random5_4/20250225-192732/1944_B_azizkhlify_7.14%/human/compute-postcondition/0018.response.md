Output State: **`i` is `n`; `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code increments the value at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `r`. Since the initial state only mentions that `i` is `n`, we know that `i` remains `n` after the operation. The exact value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is not specified, but we know it has been incremented by 1.
