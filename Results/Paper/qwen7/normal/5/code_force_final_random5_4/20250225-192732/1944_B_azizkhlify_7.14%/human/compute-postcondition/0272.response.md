Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is `n`
- `n` must be a positive integer
- `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = n` to `i < 2 * n`.
2. **Incrementing `i`**: At each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.
3. **Termination Condition**: The loop will terminate when `i` reaches `2 * n`.

### Current State
- `i` is currently `n`.
- For the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented to `n + 1`.

### Adjusted State
- `i` will be `n + 1`.
- `n` remains a positive integer.
- Since `i` is now `n + 1`, `r[a[i] - 1]` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.

### Final State
State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be a positive integer, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1**
