You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. For each test case, it prints pairs of identical numbers from the list `a` according to specific conditions involving `n` and `k`. The function ensures that the first half of the list `a` is fully processed before moving to the second half. If the counts of certain elements do not match, it continues processing the second half of the list. Finally, it prints any remaining elements from a result list and ends with the value `2 * n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the array `a`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Arrays `l` and `r` are initialized with zeros.
   - Variables `re`, `ul`, and `ur` are initialized to zero.
   - An empty list `res` is created to store elements for the second part of the solution.

3. **Counting Elements in `l`:**
   - The program iterates through the first half of the array `a` and counts occurrences of each element in `l`.

4. **Counting Elements in `r`:**
   - Similarly, it iterates through the second half of the array `a` and counts occurrences of each element in `r`.

5. **Constructing `l`:**
   - The program tries to construct `l` by selecting pairs of elements from the first half of `a` that appear exactly twice.
   - If it finds enough such pairs, it prints them out and increments `ul` accordingly.

6. **Handling Remaining Elements for `l`:**
   - If there are still elements needed to complete `l` (i.e., `ul < k * 2`), it selects single occurrences from the first half of `a` and appends them to `res`.

7. **Printing `l`:**
   - The program prints the constructed `l` and the elements stored in `res`.

8. **Constructing `r`:**
   - The program constructs `r` by selecting pairs of elements from the second half of `a` that appear exactly twice.
   - If necessary, it uses elements from `res` to ensure the XOR condition is met.

9. **Printing `r`:**
   - The program prints the constructed `r`.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Logic for Constructing `l`:**
   - The program assumes that finding pairs in the first half will automatically balance the XOR condition. However, this is not necessarily true. The XOR of the selected elements in `l` might not match the XOR of the selected elements in `r`.

2. **Incomplete Handling of Remaining Elements:**
   - The program only handles remaining elements for `l` and does not ensure that the XOR condition is met when constructing `r`. This could lead to incorrect results.

3. **Potential Overwriting of `res`:**
   - The program uses `res` to store elements for `l` and then reuses it for `r`. This could overwrite the elements needed for `l`.

### Conclusion

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
