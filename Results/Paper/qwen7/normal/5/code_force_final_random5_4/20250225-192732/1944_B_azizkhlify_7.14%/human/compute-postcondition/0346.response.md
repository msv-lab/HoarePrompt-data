Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` is a non-empty list that contains elements from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, up to a maximum of `k` elements if `k` is non-zero.
- `i` is the next element in `res`.

The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `i`, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

To determine the value of `i`, we need to understand how `res` is constructed. Since `res` is built by selecting elements from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, and `i` is the next element in `res`, `i` must be one of the indices from `a` that satisfy the condition `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`.

However, without the specific values of `a` and `l`, we cannot determine the exact value of `i`. But we know that `i` is an element that satisfies the condition mentioned.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `i` followed by a space.

Output: **i (where i is an element from a that satisfies l[a[i] - 1] == 1)**
