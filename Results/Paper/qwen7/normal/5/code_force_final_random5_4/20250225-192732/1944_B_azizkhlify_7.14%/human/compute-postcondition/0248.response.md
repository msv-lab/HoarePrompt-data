Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `res` must have at least one element, `n` is a non-negative integer, `ur` is 2 more than its previous value, `ul` equals `ur`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since the `break` statement is the only line of code, it means that the loop or conditional block is exited, but no changes are made to the values of the variables `i`, `res`, `n`, `ur`, `ul`, or the condition related to `r[a[i] - 1]`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain as they were before the execution of the `break` statement.
