Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` and the collection `res`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `res` contains at least one element and `i` is an element from `res`.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `res` must contain at least one element.
   - `i` is an element from `res`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `res` must still contain at least one element.
   - `i` will be set to the next element from `res`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is an element from `res`, after the current iteration, `i` will be some element from `res`.
   - `res` must still contain at least one element for the loop to continue.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `res` still contains at least one element and `i` is now the next element from `res`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`res` must contain at least one element, and `i` is an element from `res`**
