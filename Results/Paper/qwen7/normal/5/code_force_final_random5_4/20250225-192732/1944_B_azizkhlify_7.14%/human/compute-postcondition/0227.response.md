Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `res` must have at least one element, but the value of `res` itself is not relevant to the print statement.
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - The current value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is equal to `n`.
- Therefore, `a[i]` is equivalent to `a[n]`.

We also know that `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, which means:
- `r[a[n] - 1] = 2`.

However, the print statement only involves `a[i]` (or `a[n]`) and does not involve `r` directly. The value of `a[n]` is not explicitly given, but it doesn't affect the output of the print statement since we are only printing `a[i]` twice.

Given this, the print statement will output the value of `a[n]` followed by another instance of `a[n]`, with a space between them.

Output: **a[n] a[n]**
