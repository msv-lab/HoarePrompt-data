Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `l[a[1] - 1]` is incremented by 1 (This information is not directly relevant to adjusting the loop head variables but is part of the overall program state)

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, so for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, `i` will become 2 in the next iteration.
   - `n` must remain greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be greater than 0

So, the final answer is:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0**
