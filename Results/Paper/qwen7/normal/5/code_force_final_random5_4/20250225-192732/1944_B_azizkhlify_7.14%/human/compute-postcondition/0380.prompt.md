Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. For each test case, n and k are integers satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 × 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. The list a is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    l = [0] * n
    r = [0] * n
    re = ul = ur = 0
    res = []
    for i in range(n):
        l[a[i] - 1] += 1
    for i in range(n, 2 * n):
        r[a[i] - 1] += 1
    for i in range(n):
        if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
            print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
            ul += 2
        if ul == k * 2:
            break
    k = 2 * k - ul
    if k:
        for i in range(n):
            if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
                print(a[i], end=' ')
                re += 1
                res.append(a[i])
            if re == k:
                break
    print()
    for i in res:
        print(i, end=' ')
    if ul != ur:
        for i in range(n, 2 * n):
            if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
                print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
                ur += 2
            if ul == ur:
                break
    print()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The loop will continue to print each element in `res` until `res` is empty. If the condition `ul == ur` is met or the loop has iterated through all elements from `n` to `2 * n - 1`, `i` will be `2 * n`, `n` is a positive integer, and `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 2 if it was equal to 2 during any iteration. The variable `ur` will be incremented by 2 for each element in `a` that meets the condition `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`. If `ul` equals `ur` at any point during the loop, the loop will exit prematurely.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The loop has executed completely, printing pairs of identical numbers from the array `a` until either `ul` equals `ur` or there are no more elements in `res`. The final value of `i` is `2 * n`, `res` is empty, and both `ul` and `ur` are equal.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `res` is a list that contains elements from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1, up to a maximum of `k` elements if `k` is non-zero. If `k` is zero, `res` remains unchanged, and `i` is the last element in `res` after the loop has executed all iterations. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, then after all iterations, `i` is `2 * n`, and the values of `r`, `a`, `ur`, and `ul` remain unchanged from their values after the third iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
