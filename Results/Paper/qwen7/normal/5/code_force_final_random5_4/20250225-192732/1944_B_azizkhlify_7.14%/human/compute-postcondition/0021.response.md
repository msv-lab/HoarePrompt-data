Output State: **`i` is `2*n-1`; `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.**

After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will have the value `2*n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all `2*n` iterations. At the last iteration, `i` is `2*n-1`, and `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1, as per the loop body.
