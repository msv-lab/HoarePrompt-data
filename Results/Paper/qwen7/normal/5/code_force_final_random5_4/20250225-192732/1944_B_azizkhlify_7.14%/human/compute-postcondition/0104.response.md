Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `r` is a list where the element at index `a[i] - 1` is equal to 2, and `ur` is incremented by 2 if the element at index `a[i] - 1` in `r` is 2; otherwise, `ur` remains unchanged, and the condition `ul` is equal to `ur` is satisfied.
