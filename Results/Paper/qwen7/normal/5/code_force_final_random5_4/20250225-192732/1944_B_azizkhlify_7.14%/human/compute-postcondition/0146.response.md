Output State: **`i` is 4; `n` must be greater than or equal to 4; `r[a[3] - 1]` is incremented by 1 and now equals `r[a[3] - 1] + 1`**

Explanation: The code `r[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value of `r[a[3] - 1]` by 1. Since `i` is 4, `a[i]` is `a[4]`. However, the exact value of `a[4]` is not provided, so we keep it as `a[4]`. The value of `r[a[3] - 1]` is incremented by 1, making it `r[a[3] - 1] + 1`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
