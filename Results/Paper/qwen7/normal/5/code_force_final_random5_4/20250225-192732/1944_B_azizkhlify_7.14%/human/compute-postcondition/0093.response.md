Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the object `res`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `res` contains at least one element.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `res` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `res` must still contain at least one element.
   - The variable `i` will be set to the first element of `res` in the next iteration.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - Since `res` must still contain at least one element for the loop to execute again, we keep this condition.
   - The variable `i` will be set to the first element of `res`, but since we don't know the exact value of the first element, we only need to ensure `res` still has at least one element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`res` must contain at least one element**
