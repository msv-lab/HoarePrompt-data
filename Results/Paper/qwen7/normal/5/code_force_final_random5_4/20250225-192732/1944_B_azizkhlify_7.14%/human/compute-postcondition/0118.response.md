Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is defined as `n + 2`.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 2 if it was equal to 2. This implies that `a[i] - 1` must have been 2 previously for this condition to hold true.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
   ```

Given the initial state:
- Since `i` is `n + 2`, we know that `i` is a specific index in the list `a`.
- The value of `a[i]` must be such that `a[i] - 1` equals 2, meaning `a[i]` must be 3.

Therefore, the code snippet will print the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to the `end=' '` parameter).

Output: **3 3**
