Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `r`, `a`, `ur` is `ur + 2`, and `ul` are the same as at the end of the previous iteration.**

Explanation: The code `ur += 2` increments the value of `ur` by 2. Since `i` is `n + 1`, `r`, `a`, and `ul` remain unchanged from their values at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, `ur` is updated to `ur + 2`.
