Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`; `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code `r[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` by 1. Since `a[i]` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know that `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` remains `n + 1` as no operation was performed on it.
