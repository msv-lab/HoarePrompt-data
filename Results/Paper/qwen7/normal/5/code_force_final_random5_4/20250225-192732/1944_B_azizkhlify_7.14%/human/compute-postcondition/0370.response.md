Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `r`, `a`, `ur` remain the same as at the end of the previous iteration, `ul` equals `ur`, and `ur` is increased by 2.**

Explanation: The variable `ur` is incremented by 2. Since `i` is `n + 2`, `r`, `a`, and `ur` remain the same as at the end of the previous iteration unless otherwise specified. Additionally, the condition for breaking out of the loop (`ul == ur`) remains unchanged, meaning if it was true before, it is still true now.
