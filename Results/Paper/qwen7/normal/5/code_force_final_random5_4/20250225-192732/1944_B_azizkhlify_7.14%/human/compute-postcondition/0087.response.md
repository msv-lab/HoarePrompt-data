Postcondition: `i` is `-1`, `re` is either `k` or less than `k`, `res` contains elements from `a` based on the condition `l[a[i] - 1] == 1`, and `l[a[i] - 1]` equals 1 for all elements in `res`. This is because if `k` is true, `i` becomes `-1`, `re` is either `k` or less than `k`, `res` includes elements from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is `1`, and `l[a[i] - 1]` remains `1` for all elements in `res`. Since there is no else part, these conditions hold regardless of the if condition's outcome.
