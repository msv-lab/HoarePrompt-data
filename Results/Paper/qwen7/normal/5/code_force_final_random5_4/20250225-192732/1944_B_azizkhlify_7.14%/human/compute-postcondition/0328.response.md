Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` is a list containing `[3, 5]`.
- `l` is a list containing `[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]`.
- `a` is a list containing `[3, 4, 2]`.
- `i` is `3`.
- `n` is `5`.

The `print(a[i], end=' ')` statement will print the element at index `i` in the list `a`.

Given that `i` is `3`, the element at index `3` in the list `a` is `2`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **2**
