Output State: **`i` is `n`, `res` must have at least one element, `n` is a non-negative integer, and if `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, then `ur` is 2 more than its previous value. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is not 2, the values of `i`, `res`, `n`, and `ur` remain unchanged from their preconditions, and `ul` equals `ur`. We break out of the loop or if statement we were inside.**

This output state indicates that the `break` statement has been executed, which means we exit the loop or conditional block we are in. All the conditions and values of the variables before the `break` statement remain unchanged except that we exit the current control structure.
