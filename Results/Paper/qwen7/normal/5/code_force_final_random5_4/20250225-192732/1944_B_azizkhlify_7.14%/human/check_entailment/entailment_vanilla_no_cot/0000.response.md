Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Initialization and Logic for `l` and `r`:**
   - The code initializes `l` and `r` as lists of zeros with a length of `n`, which is incorrect since `l` and `r` should be of length `2k`.
   - The logic for populating `l` and `r` is flawed. It tries to directly assign values to `l` and `r` based on the count of occurrences, which does not guarantee the correct subset selection.

2. **XOR Calculation and Subset Selection:**
   - The code attempts to select elements for `l` and `r` based on the count of their occurrences, but this approach does not ensure that the XOR of elements in `l` equals the XOR of elements in `r`.
   - The logic for selecting elements to achieve the required XOR value is missing.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The code prints elements in pairs, but it does not ensure that the XOR of the selected elements in `l` equals the XOR of the selected elements in `r`.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to:
1. Calculate the XOR of the entire array.
2. Use a greedy approach to select elements for `l` and `r` such that their XOR values match.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate the XOR of the entire array
        xor_all = 0
        for num in a:
            xor_all ^= num
        
        # Initialize l and r
        l = []
        r = []
        
        # Function to find elements for l and r
        def find_elements(xor_target, arr, subset):
            xor_subset = 0
            for i in range(len(arr)):
                if arr[i] not in subset:
                    subset.append(arr[i])
                    xor_subset ^= arr[i]
                    if xor_subset == xor_target:
                        return True
                    if find_elements(xor_target, arr, subset):
                        return True
                    subset.remove(arr[i])
                    xor_subset ^= arr[i]
            return False
        
        # Find elements for l
        l_subset = []
        find_elements(xor_all, a[:n], l_subset)
        l.extend(l_subset)
        
        # Find elements for r
        r_subset = []
        find_elements(xor_all, a[n:], r_subset)
        r.extend(r_subset)
        
        # Ensure the lengths of l and r are 2k
        while len(l) < 2 * k:
            l.append(l[-1])
        while len(r) < 2 * k:
            r.append(r[-1])
        
        # Print the results
        print(' '.join(map(str, l)))
        print(' '.join(map(str, r)))

func()
```

This solution ensures that the XOR of elements in `l` equals the XOR of elements in `r` by using a recursive function to find suitable elements.
