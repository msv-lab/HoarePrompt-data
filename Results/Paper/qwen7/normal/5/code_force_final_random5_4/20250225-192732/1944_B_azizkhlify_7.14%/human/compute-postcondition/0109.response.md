Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = n` to `i < 2 * n`.

3. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `n`**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `n` is a positive integer.

4. **Calculate the new state of `i`**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, the new value of `i` will be `n + 1`.

5. **Check if the loop should continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < 2 * n`.
   - Given that `i` starts at `n` and increases by 1, the loop will continue until `i` reaches `2 * n`.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be `n + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same (a positive integer).

7. **Other variables (`a`, `r`, `ur`, `ul`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head**.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer**
