Output State: **`i` is 8, `ul` is the original value of `ul` plus 2, and `l[a[8] - 1]` is either 2 or remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or match a case in a switch statement. In this context, it does not change the values of any variables but rather indicates the exit from a loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of `i`, `ul`, and `l[a[8] - 1]` remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
