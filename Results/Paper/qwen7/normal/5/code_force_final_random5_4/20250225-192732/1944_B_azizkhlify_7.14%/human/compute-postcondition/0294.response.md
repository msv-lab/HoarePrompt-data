Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, and `l[a[i] - 1]` is either 2 or has not been checked, depending on the condition being true or false. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block indicated in the initial state, the only effect is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `i`, `n`, and `l[a[i] - 1]` remain unchanged as per the initial state.
