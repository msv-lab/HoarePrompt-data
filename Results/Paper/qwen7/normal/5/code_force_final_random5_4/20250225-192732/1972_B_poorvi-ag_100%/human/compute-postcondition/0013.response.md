Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string input by the user, `results` is a list, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the integer input by the user.**

The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `arr`, `results`, and the updated `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
