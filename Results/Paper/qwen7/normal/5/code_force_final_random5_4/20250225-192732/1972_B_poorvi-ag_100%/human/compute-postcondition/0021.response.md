Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer input by the user, `arr` is the string input by the user, `results` is a list with either 'yes' or 'no' appended, `i` is `i + 1`, `arr` is updated to the new string input by the user**.

Explanation: The code `arr = input()` takes a string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer input by the user, `results` is a list with either 'yes' or 'no' appended, and `i` is `i + 1` remains valid. The only change is that `arr` is now updated to the new string input by the user.
