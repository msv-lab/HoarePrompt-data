Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`, the value of `t` remains within this range after executing the code. The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
