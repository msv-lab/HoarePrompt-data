Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string input by the user, the count of 'U' in `arr` is odd, `results` is a list containing 'yes'**.

The code appends the string 'yes' to the list `results`. Since `results` was not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be a new list created by the append operation. The other variables remain unchanged.
