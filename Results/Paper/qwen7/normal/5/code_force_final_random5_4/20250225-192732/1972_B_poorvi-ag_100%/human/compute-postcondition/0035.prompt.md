Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The final output state will be a list named `results` that contains either 'yes' or 'no' for each iteration of the loop from 0 to `t-1`. For each iteration, if the count of 'U' in the string `arr` is odd, 'yes' is appended to `results`; otherwise, 'no' is appended. The variable `t` will be set to 0 after all iterations, as it is decremented by one in each iteration until it reaches 0. The variable `i` will be equal to `t-1` after all iterations since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `results` will contain 'yes' or 'no' based on whether the count of 'U' in each input string `arr` is odd or even, for a total of `t` such evaluations. The variable `t` will be 0, and `i` will be `t-1`, which means `i` will also be 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in results:
    print(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `results` is a list of strings that contains 'yes' or 'no' for each iteration, `t` is the length of `results`, and `i` is `t-1`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: 

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is the next element in `results`, `results` must have at least one element remaining




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
