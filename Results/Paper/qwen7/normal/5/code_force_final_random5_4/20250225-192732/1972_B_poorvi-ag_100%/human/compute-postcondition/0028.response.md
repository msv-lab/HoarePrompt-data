Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head includes the variable `i` and the object `results`.

2. **Understand the Loop Behavior**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list.
   - Each element in `results` is either `'yes'` or `'no'`.
   - The loop does not modify `results` directly; it only iterates over its elements.

3. **Determine the Initial State**:
   - The final state of `results` is given as a list containing 'yes' or 'no' for each iteration of the loop from 0 to `t-1`.
   - After all iterations, `t` is set to 0.
   - After all iterations, `i` is set to `t-1`, which means `i` will be 0.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since the loop only iterates over `results`, the initial state of `results` needs to be set correctly.
   - `t` should be set to the number of iterations (which is the length of `results`).
   - `i` should be set to `t-1` initially, but this value will be overwritten during the loop execution.

Given these points, the initial state before the loop starts should be:

- `results` is a list of strings, where each string is either `'yes'` or `'no'`.
- `t` is the length of `results`.
- `i` is initially set to `t-1`.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`results` is a list of strings that contains 'yes' or 'no' for each iteration, `t` is the length of `results`, and `i` is `t-1`**.
