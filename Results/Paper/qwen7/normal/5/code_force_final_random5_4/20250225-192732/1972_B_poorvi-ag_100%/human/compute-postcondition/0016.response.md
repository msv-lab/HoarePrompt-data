Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer input by the user, `arr` is the string input by the user, `results` is a list with 'no' appended, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `results.append('no')` appends the string `'no'` to the list `results`. The values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
