You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program: 
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = input()
        if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
            results.append('yes')
        else:

        print(i)



- Annotated Code: 
from collections import Counter

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and s is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D" representing the initial state of the coins.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: Output State: The final output state will be a list named `results` that contains either 'yes' or 'no' for each iteration of the loop from 0 to `t-1`. For each iteration, if the count of 'U' in the string `arr` is odd, 'yes' is appended to `results`; otherwise, 'no' is appended. The variable `t` will be set to 0 after all iterations, as it is decremented by one in each iteration until it reaches 0. The variable `i` will be equal to `t-1` after all iterations since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `results` will contain 'yes' or 'no' based on whether the count of 'U' in each input string `arr` is odd or even, for a total of `t` such evaluations. The variable `t` will be 0, and `i` will be `t-1`, which means `i` will also be 0.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: The final output state will be a list named `results` that contains 'yes' or 'no' for each iteration from 0 to `t-1`. After all iterations, `t` will be 0, and `i` will also be 0.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `arr` representing the initial state of the coins.

2. **Logic for Determining Winner**:
   - The program checks if the count of 'U' (up-facing coins) in the string `arr` is odd.
   - If the count of 'U' is odd, it appends 'yes' to the results list.
   - Otherwise, it appends 'no' to the results list.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints each result from the results list.

### Reasoning:

The logic in the program is based on the observation that if the number of up-facing coins (`U`) is odd, Alice can force a win by playing optimally. This is because:
- Each move removes an up-facing coin and flips its neighbors.
- If the number of up-facing coins is odd, Alice can always make a move that leaves an even number of up-facing coins for Bob, forcing Bob into a losing position eventually.

However, the program's logic is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the game rules. Specifically, it does not account for the game mechanics where coins are removed and flipped based on their neighbors. The program simply checks the parity of the number of up-facing coins, which is not sufficient to determine the winner.

### Example Analysis:

- **Test Case 1**: `UUDUD`
  - Initial state: `UUDUD`
  - Count of 'U': 3 (odd)
  - According to the program, Alice wins ('yes').
  - However, let's simulate the game:
    - Alice removes the first 'U' and flips the next two coins: `DDUU`.
    - Bob removes the first 'D' and flips the next two coins: `UDD`.
    - Alice removes the first 'U' and flips the next two coins: `UU`.
    - Bob removes the first 'U' and the game ends with no more moves for Alice.
    - Alice wins, but the program incorrectly says 'yes'.

- **Test Case 2**: `UDDUD`
  - Initial state: `UDDUD`
  - Count of 'U': 2 (even)
  - According to the program, Alice loses ('no').
  - Let's simulate the game:
    - Alice removes the first 'U' and flips the next two coins: `DDDU`.
    - Bob removes the first 'D' and flips the next two coins: `UUDD`.
    - Alice removes the first 'U' and flips the next two coins: `DD`.
    - Bob removes the first 'D' and the game ends with no more moves for Alice.
    - Alice loses, and the program correctly says 'no'.

- **Test Case 3**: `UU`
  - Initial state: `UU`
  - Count of 'U': 2 (even)
  - According to the program, Alice loses ('no').
  - Let's simulate the game:
    - Alice removes the first 'U' and flips the next two coins: `U`.
    - Bob has no valid move and loses.
    - Alice wins, and the program incorrectly says 'no'.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly simulate the game rules and thus cannot determine the winner accurately. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
