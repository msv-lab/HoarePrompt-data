Output State: The final output state will be a list named `results` that contains either 'yes' or 'no' for each iteration of the loop from 0 to `t-1`. Each entry in the `results` list corresponds to whether the count of 'U' in the input string `arr` for that iteration is odd ('yes') or even ('no'). The variable `t` will be set to 0 after all iterations, as it is decremented by one in each iteration of the loop until it reaches 0. The variable `i` will be equal to `t` (which is 0) after the last iteration, as `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop, the `results` list will contain 'yes' or 'no' for each of the `t` inputs, indicating whether the count of 'U' in the corresponding input string was odd or even. The variable `t` will be 0, and `i` will also be 0 since it increments with each iteration and `t` becomes 0 at the end.
