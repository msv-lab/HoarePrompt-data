Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer input by the user, `arr` is the new string input by the user, `results` is a list with 'yes' appended, `i` is `i + 1`**.

Explanation: The code `results.append('yes')` appends the string `'yes'` to the list `results`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation, so their states remain unchanged. Additionally, `arr` is updated to the new string input by the user, and `i` is incremented by 1.
