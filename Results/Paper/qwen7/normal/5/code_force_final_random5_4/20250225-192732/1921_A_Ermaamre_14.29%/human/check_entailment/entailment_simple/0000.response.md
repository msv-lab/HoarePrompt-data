Reasoning:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem by identifying the side length of the square using the coordinates of its corners. However, the logic in the code is flawed. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying Sides**: The code checks only three specific configurations of the coordinates to determine which pair of points form the sides of the square. This approach does not cover all possible permutations of the corner points. For example, it fails to correctly identify the sides when the points are not in the exact order specified in the conditions.

2. **No General Solution**: The code does not provide a general solution to identify the side length of the square. It relies on a hardcoded assumption about the order of the points, which is not always true. For instance, if the points are given in a different order, the code may fail to identify the correct side length.

3. **Area Calculation**: Once the side length is incorrectly identified, the area is calculated as `res ** 2`. This part of the code is correct, but the issue lies in how `res` is determined.

Given these issues, the provided code is not a correct solution to the problem. A more robust approach would involve calculating the distances between all pairs of points and identifying the maximum distance among the horizontal and vertical pairs, which would represent the side length of the square.

Correctness: **False**
