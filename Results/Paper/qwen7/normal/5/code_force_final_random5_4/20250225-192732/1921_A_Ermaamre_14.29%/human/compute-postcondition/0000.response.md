Output State: **`a` is an input integer**.

The code `a = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `a`. Since no other variables are mentioned or modified, the initial conditions for `total`, `num`, and `x` remain unchanged. The only new information is that `a` now holds the value of the integer input provided by the user.
