Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is an input integer
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())
    x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())
    x3, y3 = map(int, input().split())
    x4, y4 = map(int, input().split())
    if x1 == x3 and x2 == x4:
        if y1 < y3:
            res = abs(y3 - y1)
        else:
            res = abs(y1 - y3)
    elif x1 == x2 and x3 == x4:
        if y1 < y2:
            res = abs(y2 - y1)
        else:
            res = abs(y1 - y2)
    elif x1 == x4 and x3 == x2:
        if y1 < y2:
            res = abs(y2 - y1)
        else:
            res = abs(y1 - y2)
    print(res ** 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0; `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are as per the input. `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3` if `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`. If `y1 < y3`, `res` is the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1`. If `x1 != x3` or `x2 != x4`, then if `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4`, `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1` if `y1 < y2`, otherwise `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`. Otherwise, if `x1 == x4` and `x2 == x3`, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `x4` are input integers, `y1`, `y2`, `y3`, `y4` are input integers, `res` is the value calculated based on the conditions given. If `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`. Otherwise, if `y1 < y3`, `res` is the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1`. Otherwise, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is the first integer from the input split, `y2` is the second integer from the input split, `x3` is the first integer from the input split, `y3` is the second integer from the input split, `x4` is the third integer from the input split, `y4` is the fourth integer from the input split; `res` is the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1` if `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4` and `y1 < y3`, otherwise `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3` if `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4` and `y1 >= y3`. If `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` if `y1 < y2`, otherwise `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`. If `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` if `y1 < y2`, otherwise `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
