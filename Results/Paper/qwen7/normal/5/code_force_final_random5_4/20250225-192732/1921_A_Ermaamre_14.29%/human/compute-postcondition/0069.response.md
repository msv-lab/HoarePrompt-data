Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated inputs and converts them to integers, assigning the first input to `x1` and the second input to `y1`. The values of `x2`, `x3`, `x4`, `y2`, `y3`, `y4`, and `res` remain unchanged from their initial state. The precondition that `a` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 2 are still valid.
