Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an input integer, `y2` is an input integer, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4` are as per the input, `res` is the value calculated based on the conditions given.**

Explanation: The code `x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `x2` and `y2`. The other variables (`a`, `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4`, `res`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `a` must be greater than 0 and the values of `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4`, and `res` being as per the input remains valid.
