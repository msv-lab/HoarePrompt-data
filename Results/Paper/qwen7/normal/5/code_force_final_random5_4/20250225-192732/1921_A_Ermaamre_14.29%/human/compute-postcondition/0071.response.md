Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is the first integer from the input split, `y2` is the second integer from the input split, `x3` is the first integer from the input split, `y3` is the second integer from the input split, and both `x3` and `y3` are integers.**

Explanation: The code `x3, y3 = map(int, input().split())` takes user input and splits it into two parts, converting each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to `x3` and `y3`. The values of `a`, `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` remain unchanged, but now `x3` and `y3` are known to be integers resulting from the split input.
