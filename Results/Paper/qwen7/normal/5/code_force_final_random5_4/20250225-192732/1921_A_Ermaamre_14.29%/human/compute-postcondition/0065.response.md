Postcondition: `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `x4` are input integers, `y1`, `y2`, `y3`, `y4` are input integers, `res` is the value calculated based on the conditions given. If `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`. Otherwise, if `y1 < y3`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1`. Otherwise, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3`.
