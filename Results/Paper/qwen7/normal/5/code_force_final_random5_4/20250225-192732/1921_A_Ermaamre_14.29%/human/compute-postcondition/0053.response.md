Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an input integer, `y2` is an input integer, `x3` is an integer from input, `y3` is an integer from input, `x4` is an integer from input, `y4` is an integer from input, `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1` and assigns it to `res`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `res` is updated to be the absolute value of `y2 - y1`, while all other variables retain their initial states.
