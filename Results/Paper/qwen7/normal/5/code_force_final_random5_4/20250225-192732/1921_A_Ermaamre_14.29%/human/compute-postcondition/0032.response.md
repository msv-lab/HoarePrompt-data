Output State: **`res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is the first integer from the input split by space, `y2` is the second integer from the input split by space, `x3` is an integer from the input split by space, `y3` is an integer from the input split by space, `x4` is an integer from the input split by space, `y4` is an integer from the input split by space, `x1` is not equal to `x3` or `x2` is not equal to `x4`, the current value of `y1` is less than the current value of `y2`.**

In this case, the code calculates the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1` and assigns it to `res`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
