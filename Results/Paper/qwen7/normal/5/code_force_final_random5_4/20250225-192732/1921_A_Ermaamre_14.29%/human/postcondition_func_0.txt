The function processes a series of square corner coordinates and calculates the height of the tallest vertical line segment among them. It accepts no parameters and returns nothing, instead printing the squared height of the tallest vertical line segment for each set of coordinates provided. After processing all sets of coordinates, it prints the squared height of the tallest vertical line segment found in the last set of inputs.
