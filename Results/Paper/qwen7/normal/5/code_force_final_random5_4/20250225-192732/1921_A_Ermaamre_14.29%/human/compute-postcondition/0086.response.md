Postcondition: `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is the first integer from the input split, `y2` is the second integer from the input split, `x3` is the first integer from the input split, `y3` is the second integer from the input split, `x4` is the third integer from the input split, `y4` is the fourth integer from the input split; `res` is the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1` if `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4` and `y1 < y3`, otherwise `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3` if `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4` and `y1 >= y3`. If `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` if `y1 < y2`, otherwise `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`. If `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2`, then `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` if `y1 < y2`, otherwise `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.
