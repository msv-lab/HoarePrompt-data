Output State: **`i` is `i_end_prev + 2`; `num` is `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1`; `count` is increased by 1.**

The variable `count` is incremented by 1, `i` is updated to `i_end_prev + 2`, and the value of `num` remains unchanged as it is based on the list indices which are not affected by the increment in `i`.
