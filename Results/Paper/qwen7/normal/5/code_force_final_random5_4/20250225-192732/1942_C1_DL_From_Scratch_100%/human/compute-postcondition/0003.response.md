Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `list0` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

The code `list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `list0`. The initial values of `T`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
