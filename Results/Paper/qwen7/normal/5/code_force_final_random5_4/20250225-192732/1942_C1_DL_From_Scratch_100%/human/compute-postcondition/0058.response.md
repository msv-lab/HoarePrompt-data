The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` (which is a placeholder for the loop index) and `T`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `T`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the loop has executed \(x-1\) times. This means that `T` must have been set to \(x-1\). For the loop to execute one more time, `T` needs to be incremented by 1, making it \(x\).

Since the loop body is omitted, no other variables are modified within the loop itself. Therefore, the state of `i`, `num`, and `count` remains unchanged.

State: **`T` is \(x\)**
