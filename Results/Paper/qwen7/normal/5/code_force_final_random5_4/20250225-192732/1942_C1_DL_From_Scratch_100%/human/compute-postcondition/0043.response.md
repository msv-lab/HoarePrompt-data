Output State: **`i` is `i_end_prev + 1`; `num` is `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `num` is assigned the value of `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1`. Here, `i` is initially `i_end_prev + 1`, so `i + 1` would be `i_end_prev + 2`. The values of `list0[i]` and `list0[i + 1]` are used to calculate `num`. The states of the other variables (`i_end_prev` and `list0`) remain unchanged.
