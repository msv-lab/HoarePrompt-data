Postcondition: `count` is 3, `T` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `list0` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `i` is `i_end_prev + 2`, `num` is `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1`, and if `num` equals 1, then `count` remains 3.
