Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input, `d` is equal to `c / 2`**.

Explanation: The code assigns `c / 2` to `d`. Since `c` is an integer obtained from the input, `d` is now half of `c`. All other variables remain unchanged.
