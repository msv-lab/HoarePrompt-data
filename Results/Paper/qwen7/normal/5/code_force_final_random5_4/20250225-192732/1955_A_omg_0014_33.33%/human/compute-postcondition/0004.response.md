Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `d` is equal to `c / 2`.**

This means that the variable `d` is now assigned the value of `c / 2`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
