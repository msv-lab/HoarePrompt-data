You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        d = c / 2
        
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces for each iteration, `d` is equal to `c / 2` for each iteration, and the program prints either `a * b` or `round(a * d)` based on the if condition for each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then enters a loop that runs `n` times, reading three integers `(a, b, c)` for each test case.
   
2. **Calculating Costs:**
   - The variable `d` is assigned the value of `c / 2`, which is the price of one yogurt when bought under the promotion.
   - The program checks if the cost of buying one yogurt at the regular price (`a * b`) is less than the cost of buying one yogurt at the promotion price (`a * d`).
   - If `a * b` is less, it prints `a * b`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `round(a * d)`.

3. **Promotion Logic:**
   - The logic in the program does not correctly implement the promotion. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that you can buy multiple pairs of yogurts under the promotion and potentially mix regular and promotional purchases to minimize cost.
   - For example, if `n` is even, buying all yogurts in pairs would be optimal. If `n` is odd, you should buy the last yogurt at the regular price after buying as many pairs as possible at the promotion price.
   - The current logic only considers buying one yogurt at a time at the promotion price, which might not always yield the minimum cost.

### Example Analysis:

- **Test Case 1:** 
  - Input: `2 5 9`
  - Regular cost per yogurt: 5
  - Promotion cost for 2 yogurts: 9
  - Optimal: Buy both yogurts at the promotion price -> Cost: 9
  - Program Output: 9 (Correct)

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `3 5 9`
  - Regular cost per yogurt: 5
  - Promotion cost for 2 yogurts: 9
  - Optimal: Buy 2 yogurts at the promotion price and 1 at the regular price -> Cost: 9 + 5 = 14
  - Program Output: 14 (Correct)

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `3 5 11`
  - Regular cost per yogurt: 5
  - Promotion cost for 2 yogurts: 11
  - Optimal: Buy 2 yogurts at the promotion price and 1 at the regular price -> Cost: 11 + 5 = 16
  - Program Output: 15 (Incorrect, should be 16)

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `4 5 11`
  - Regular cost per yogurt: 5
  - Promotion cost for 2 yogurts: 11
  - Optimal: Buy 2 pairs of yogurts at the promotion price -> Cost: 11 * 2 = 22
  - Program Output: 20 (Incorrect, should be 22)

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the promotion logic, leading to incorrect outputs in some cases.

Correctness: **False**
