Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The variable `i` is initialized to 0 and incremented by 1 in each iteration.
   - The variable `n` determines the number of iterations the loop will run.

3. **Initial state given**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n`.
   - The variable `i` should start at 0, as it is the initial value for the loop.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` must be 0.

The final state should be:
**`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**.
