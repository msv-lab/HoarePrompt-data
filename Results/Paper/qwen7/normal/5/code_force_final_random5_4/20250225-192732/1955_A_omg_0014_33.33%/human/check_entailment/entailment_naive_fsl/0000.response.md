Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for buying \( n \) yogurts under the given promotion. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the average cost per yogurt for the promotion (`d = c / 2`) and uses this to compare with the regular price. This approach does not always yield the minimum cost.

For example, consider the case where \( n = 3 \), \( a = 5 \), and \( b = 11 \). According to the problem description, the optimal strategy is to buy three yogurts for 15 burles (since \( 3 \times \frac{11}{2} = 16.5 \), which rounds to 17, but buying three for 15 is cheaper). However, the program would incorrectly calculate \( d = 11 / 2 = 5.5 \), and since \( 3 \times 5 < 3 \times 5.5 \), it would print 15, which is incorrect.

The correct approach should involve calculating the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and then handling the remaining yogurts at the regular price.
