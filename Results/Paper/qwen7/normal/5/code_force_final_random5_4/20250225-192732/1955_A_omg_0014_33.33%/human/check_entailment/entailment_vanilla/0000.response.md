Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then enters a loop that runs `n` times, reading three integers `(a, b, c)` for each test case.
   
2. **Calculating Costs:**
   - The variable `d` is assigned the value of `c / 2`, which is the price of one yogurt when bought under the promotion.
   - The program checks if the cost of buying one yogurt at the regular price (`a * b`) is less than the cost of buying one yogurt at the promotion price (`a * d`).
   - If `a * b` is less, it prints `a * b`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `round(a * d)`.

3. **Promotion Logic:**
   - The logic in the program does not correctly implement the promotion. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that you can buy multiple pairs of yogurts under the promotion and potentially mix regular and promotional purchases to minimize cost.
   - For example, if `n` is even, buying all yogurts in pairs would be optimal. If `n` is odd, you should buy the last yogurt at the regular price after buying as many pairs as possible at the promotion price.
   - The current logic only considers buying one yogurt at a time at the promotion price, which might not always yield the minimum cost.

### Example Analysis:

- **Test Case 1:** 
  - Input: `2 5 9`
  - Regular cost per yogurt: 5
  - Promotion cost for 2 yogurts: 9
  - Optimal: Buy both yogurts at the promotion price -> Cost: 9
  - Program Output: 9 (Correct)

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `3 5 9`
  - Regular cost per yogurt: 5
  - Promotion cost for 2 yogurts: 9
  - Optimal: Buy 2 yogurts at the promotion price and 1 at the regular price -> Cost: 9 + 5 = 14
  - Program Output: 14 (Correct)

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `3 5 11`
  - Regular cost per yogurt: 5
  - Promotion cost for 2 yogurts: 11
  - Optimal: Buy 2 yogurts at the promotion price and 1 at the regular price -> Cost: 11 + 5 = 16
  - Program Output: 15 (Incorrect, should be 16)

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `4 5 11`
  - Regular cost per yogurt: 5
  - Promotion cost for 2 yogurts: 11
  - Optimal: Buy 2 pairs of yogurts at the promotion price -> Cost: 11 * 2 = 22
  - Program Output: 20 (Incorrect, should be 22)

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the promotion logic, leading to incorrect outputs in some cases.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
