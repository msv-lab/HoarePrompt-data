Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given conditions. The logic in the program is flawed because it incorrectly compares the total cost of buying all yogurts at the regular price (`a * b`) with half the promotional price (`d = c / 2`). This comparison does not take into account the optimal way to use the promotion to minimize the cost.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider how many pairs of yogurts can be bought under the promotion and how many individual yogurts will remain. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the number of pairs that can be bought
        pairs = n // 2
        # Calculate the remaining individual yogurts
        remaining = n % 2
        # Calculate the total cost
        total_cost = pairs * b + remaining * a
        print(total_cost)

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that the minimum cost is calculated by optimally using the promotion for pairs of yogurts and buying any remaining individual yogurts at the regular price.
