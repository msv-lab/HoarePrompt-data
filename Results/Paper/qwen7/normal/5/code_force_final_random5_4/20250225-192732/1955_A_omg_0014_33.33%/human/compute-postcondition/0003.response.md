Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces**.

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads three space-separated integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged, and the condition for `n` being greater than 0 is not directly affected by this code snippet.
