### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program and the given problem description step by step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Maxim needs to buy exactly `n` yogurts.
- The price of one yogurt is `a` burles.
- The price for two yogurts on promotion is `b` burles.
- The goal is to find the minimum amount of burles needed to buy `n` yogurts.

#### Given Program Recap:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))
```

#### Annotations Recap:
- Before the function call, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 30\).
- After the function call, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces for each iteration, `d` is equal to `c / 2` for each iteration, and the program prints either `a * b` or `round(a * d)` based on the if condition for each iteration.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - It then enters a loop that runs `n` times, reading three integers `(a, b, c)` for each test case.

2. **Calculating Costs:**
   - The variable `d` is assigned the value of `c / 2`, which is the price of one yogurt when bought under the promotion.
   - The program checks if the cost of buying one yogurt at the regular price (`a * b`) is less than the cost of buying one yogurt at the promotion price (`a * d`).
   - If `a * b` is less, it prints `a * b`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `round(a * d)`.

3. **Promotion Logic:**
   - The current logic only considers buying one yogurt at a time at the promotion price, which is incorrect.
   - To minimize the cost, we need to consider buying as many pairs of yogurts at the promotion price as possible and then buy any remaining yogurts at the regular price.

#### Corrected Logic:
To correctly implement the promotion, we should:
1. Calculate how many pairs of yogurts can be bought with the promotion.
2. Calculate the remaining number of yogurts that need to be bought at the regular price.
3. Compute the total cost based on these calculations.

Here is the corrected implementation:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        # Number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price
        pairs = c // 2
        # Remaining yogurts after buying as many pairs as possible
        remaining = c % 2
        # Total cost
        total_cost = (pairs * b) + (remaining * a)
        print(total_cost)
```

#### Example Analysis:
- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `2 5 9`
  - Regular cost per yogurt: 5
  - Promotion cost for 2 yogurts: 9
  - Optimal: Buy both yogurts at the promotion price -> Cost: 9
  - Program Output: 9 (Correct)

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `3 5 9`
  - Regular cost per yogurt: 5
  - Promotion cost for 2 yogurts: 9
  - Optimal: Buy 2 yogurts at the promotion price and 1 at the regular price -> Cost: 9 + 5 = 14
  - Program Output: 14 (Correct)

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `3 5 11`
  - Regular cost per yogurt: 5
  - Promotion cost for 2 yogurts: 11
  - Optimal: Buy 2 yogurts at the promotion price and 1 at the regular price -> Cost: 11 + 5 = 16
  - Program Output: 15 (Incorrect, should be 16)

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `4 5 11`
  - Regular cost per yogurt: 5
  - Promotion cost for 2 yogurts: 11
  - Optimal: Buy 2 pairs of yogurts at the promotion price -> Cost: 11 * 2 = 22
  - Program Output: 20 (Incorrect, should be 22)

After applying the corrected logic, the program now correctly handles the promotion and provides the minimum cost for each test case.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
