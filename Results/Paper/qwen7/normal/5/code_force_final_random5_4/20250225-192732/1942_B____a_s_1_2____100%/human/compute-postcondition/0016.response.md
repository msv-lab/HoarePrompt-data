Output State: `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `i` is `0`; `mex` is updated to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[0]`; `p[i]` is now `mex - a[i]` for all `i` in the range of `n`.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `n` will still be an integer greater than or equal to 1. The variable `i` will be 0 because the loop has completed all its iterations, starting from `n-1` and decrementing by 1 until it reaches 0. The variable `mex` will be the smallest value among all elements in the list `p`. Each element `p[i]` will be calculated as `mex - a[i]` for every index `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
