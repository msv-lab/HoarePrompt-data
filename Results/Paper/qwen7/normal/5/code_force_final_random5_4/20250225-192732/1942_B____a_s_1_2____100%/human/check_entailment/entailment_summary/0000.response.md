Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by constructing a permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \). The logic implemented in the program is as follows:

1. It reads the number of test cases \( t \).
2. For each test case, it reads the size \( n \) and the array \( a \) of length \( n \).
3. It initializes a list \( p \) with `-1` for each position.
4. It iterates backward through the array \( a \), setting \( p[i] \) to \( \text{mex} - a[i] \) and updating \( \text{mex} \) to be the minimum of the current \( \text{mex} \) and the newly assigned value of \( p[i] \).

However, there are a few issues with this approach:
- The variable `mex` is initialized to `n`, which might not always correctly represent the smallest non-negative integer not present in the list `p`.
- The backward iteration and the way `mex` is updated might not guarantee that the smallest non-negative integer not present in `p` is correctly identified and used for each position.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that the smallest non-negative integer not present in the list `p` is correctly identified and used for each position. A more appropriate approach would be to use a set to keep track of the integers already present in `p` and update the `mex` accordingly.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution.

Correctness: **False**
