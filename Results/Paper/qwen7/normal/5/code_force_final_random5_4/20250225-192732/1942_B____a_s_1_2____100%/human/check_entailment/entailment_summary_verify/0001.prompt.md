You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            mex = min(mex, p[i])
        print(*p)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then constructs a permutation `p` of length `n` such that for each index `i`, `p[i]` equals `mex - a[i]`, where `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the list `p`. After constructing the permutation, it prints the elements of `p`. The function does not return any value but modifies and prints the permutation `p` for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that for each \( i \), \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).
   - \(\texttt{MEX}\) of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
   
2. **Given Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and the array \( a \).
   - It initializes a list `p` with `-1` values.
   - It calculates the \(\texttt{MEX}\) value (`mex`) and updates the permutation `p` in reverse order.
   - For each index \( i \), it sets \( p[i] = \texttt{MEX} - a[i] \) and updates the \(\texttt{MEX}\) value to be the minimum of the current \(\texttt{MEX}\) and the newly set \( p[i] \).

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic seems to be attempting to find the \(\texttt{MEX}\) and update the permutation accordingly.
   - However, the approach to calculate \(\texttt{MEX}\) in reverse order and directly updating the permutation might not always yield the correct result because \(\texttt{MEX}\) should be calculated based on the current state of the permutation, not just the remaining elements.

4. **Example Verification:**
   - Let's verify with the provided examples:
     - For the first example: \( n = 5 \), \( a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] \)
       - The correct permutation could be \( p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] \).
       - Calculating \(\texttt{MEX}\) correctly for each step:
         - \( \texttt{MEX}([0]) = 1 \Rightarrow a_1 = 1 - 0 = 1 \)
         - \( \texttt{MEX}([0, 1]) = 2 \Rightarrow a_2 = 2 - 1 = 1 \)
         - \( \texttt{MEX}([0, 1, 4]) = 2 \Rightarrow a_3 = 2 - 4 = -2 \)
         - \( \texttt{MEX}([0, 1, 4, 2]) = 3 \Rightarrow a_4 = 3 - 2 = 1 \)
         - \( \texttt{MEX}([0, 1, 4, 2, 3]) = 5 \Rightarrow a_5 = 5 - 3 = 2 \)
       - This matches the given \( a \).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the \(\texttt{MEX}\) and update the permutation. It uses a reverse approach which can lead to incorrect results.
