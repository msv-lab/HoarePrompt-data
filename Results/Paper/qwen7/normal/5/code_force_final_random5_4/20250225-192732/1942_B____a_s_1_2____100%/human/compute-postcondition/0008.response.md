Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `i` is `n-1`; `mex` is updated to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`; `p[i]` remains `mex - a[i]`.**

Explanation: The line `mex = min(mex, p[i])` updates the value of `mex` to be the minimum between its current value and `p[i]`. Since `p[i]` is defined as `mex - a[i]`, it does not change during this operation. The value of `n` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
