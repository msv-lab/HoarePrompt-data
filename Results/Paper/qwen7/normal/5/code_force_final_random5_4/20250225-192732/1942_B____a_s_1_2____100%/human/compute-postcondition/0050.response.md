Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be `-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `n` will remain unchanged, meaning it still holds the initial value of the input integer. The variable `mex` will be updated to the minimum value found among all elements in the list `p`. Each element `p[i]` will be equal to `mex - a[i]` for all valid indices `i`. The list `p` will have been modified according to the operations performed within the loop, with `mex` being adjusted in each iteration to ensure it reflects the smallest possible value that is not present in the list `p` as per the definition of the Mex function (the smallest non-negative integer not in the list).
