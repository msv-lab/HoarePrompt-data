Output State: `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `i` is `0`; `mex` is updated to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[0]`; `p[i]` is now `mex - a[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will have reached `0` (since the loop decrements `i` from `n-1` to `0`), and `mex` will be the smallest value found among all elements in the list `p`. Each element `p[i]` will be set to `mex - a[i]` for every index `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
