Output State: **`p[i]` is equal to `mex - a[i]` where `i` is `n - 2`; `mex` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `p[i]` to `mex - a[i]` where `i` is `n - 2`. It also updates `mex` to the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. Since `n` must be greater than 0, the precondition that `n` is greater than 0 remains valid. The values of other variables are not affected by this code snippet.
