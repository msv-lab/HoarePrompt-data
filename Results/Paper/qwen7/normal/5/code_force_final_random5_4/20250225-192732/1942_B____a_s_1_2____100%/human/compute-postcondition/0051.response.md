Based on the initial state provided, let's break down the information:

1. **Variable `i`**: It will be `-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
2. **Variable `n`**: It remains unchanged, holding the initial value of the input integer.
3. **Variable `mex`**: It is updated to the minimum value found among all elements in the list `p`.
4. **List `p`**: Each element `p[i]` is equal to `mex - a[i]` for all valid indices `i`. The list `p` has been modified according to the operations performed within the loop, with `mex` being adjusted in each iteration to ensure it reflects the smallest possible value that is not present in the list `p`.

Given these details, the `print(*p)` statement will print the modified list `p`.

To summarize, after the loop completes, the list `p` is transformed such that each element `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`, where `mex` is the minimum value found in the original list `a` (or the list from which `p` was derived).

Output: **[mex - a[0], mex - a[1], ..., mex - a[n-1]] (where `mex` is the minimum value found in the list `a` and `a` is the original list from which `p` was derived)**
