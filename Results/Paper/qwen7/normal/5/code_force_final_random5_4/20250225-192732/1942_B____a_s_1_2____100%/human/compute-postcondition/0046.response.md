Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The state at the end of the previous iteration is: `mex` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `p[n-2]`.
- The for loop is: `for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` is used in the loop.
   - The loop also uses `n` implicitly (as it iterates from `n-1` to `0`).

2. **Understand the Loop Behavior:**
   - The loop starts at `n-1` and decrements `i` until `i` reaches `-1`.
   - In each iteration, the loop body is omitted, but the loop itself updates `i` and continues until `i` becomes `-1`.

3. **Determine the New State:**
   - Since the loop is decrementing `i` from `n-1` to `0`, and then stops, the next iteration would start with `i` being `n-1` if the loop were to continue.
   - However, since the loop is decrementing, the next iteration would start with `i` being `n-2` if the loop were to continue.
   - The variable `n` remains unchanged as the loop does not modify it directly.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - The state `mex` is updated based on the value of `p[n-2]` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` should be `n-2` and the condition `i >= 0` should still hold true.

### Conclusion:
- The only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.
- `i` should be set to `n-2`.
- `n` remains unchanged.

### Final State:
State: **`mex` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `p[n-2]`, `i` is `n-2`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
