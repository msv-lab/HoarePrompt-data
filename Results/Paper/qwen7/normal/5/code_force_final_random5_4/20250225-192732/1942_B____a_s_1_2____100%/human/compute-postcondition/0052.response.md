Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be `-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `n` will remain unchanged, holding the initial value of the input integer. The variable `mex` will be updated to the minimum value found among all elements in the list `p`. Each element `p[i]` will be equal to `mex - a[i]` for all valid indices `i`. The list `p` will have been fully modified according to the operations performed within the loop, ensuring that `mex` reflects the smallest non-negative integer not present in the list `p` as defined by the Mex function.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes running, `i` will be -1 showing that all iterations are done. `n` stays the same as the original input. `mex` is the smallest number not found in the list `p`. Each `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]`, making sure `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not in `p`.
