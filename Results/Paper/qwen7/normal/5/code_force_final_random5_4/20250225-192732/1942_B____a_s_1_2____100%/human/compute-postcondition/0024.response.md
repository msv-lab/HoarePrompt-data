Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `p[0]` is `mex - a[0]`**

Explanation: The code `p[i] = mex - a[i]` updates the value of `p[i]` to `mex - a[i]`. Given that `i` is 0, the updated value of `p[0]` is `mex - a[0]`. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 0 remains unchanged.
