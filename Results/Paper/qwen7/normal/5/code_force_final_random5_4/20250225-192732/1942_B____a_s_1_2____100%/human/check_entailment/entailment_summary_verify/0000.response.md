Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's re-examine the provided program and the problem statement to confirm this.

### Analysis of the Given Program

The program attempts to construct a permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \). Here is the step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - Read the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, read the length \( n \) and the array \( a \).
   - Initialize a list `p` of length \( n \) with `-1` values.
   - Initialize `mex` to \( n \), which represents the smallest non-negative integer not present in the current permutation.

2. **Backward Construction**:
   - Iterate from \( i = n-1 \) to \( 0 \).
   - Set \( p[i] = \texttt{mex} - a[i] \).
   - Update `mex` to be the minimum of `mex` and \( p[i] \).

3. **Output**:
   - Print the permutation \( p \).

### Issues with the Program

1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**:
   - The program uses a backward construction approach, which is not appropriate for calculating the MEX. The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set, and this needs to be recalculated dynamically as we build the permutation.
   - The program directly sets \( p[i] = \texttt{mex} - a[i] \) without ensuring that the MEX is correctly updated for each step.

2. **Invalid Permutation Construction**:
   - The logic for setting \( p[i] \) does not ensure that the resulting permutation \( p \) satisfies the condition \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).
   - The program does not handle the dynamic nature of the MEX calculation correctly, leading to invalid permutations.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that the MEX is computed dynamically and that the permutation \( p \) is built correctly. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        mex = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            while mex in p[:i+1]:
                mex += 1
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            mex += 1
        
        print(*p)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program

1. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize `mex` to 0, which will be incremented as we find the correct MEX for each position.

2. **Dynamic MEX Calculation**:
   - For each index \( i \), find the smallest non-negative integer not present in the prefix \( p[:i+1] \).
   - Set \( p[i] = \texttt{mex} - a[i] \).
   - Increment `mex` to ensure the next MEX is correctly calculated.

This approach ensures that the permutation \( p \) is constructed correctly and satisfies the given conditions.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the MEX and construct the permutation \( p \).

Final: **False**
