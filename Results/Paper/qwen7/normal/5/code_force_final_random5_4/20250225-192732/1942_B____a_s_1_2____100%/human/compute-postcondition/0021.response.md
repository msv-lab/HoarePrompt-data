Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `mex` is updated to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[0]`, `p[i]` is now `mex - a[i]` for all `i` in the range of `n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `p` is a list of length `n` initialized to -1 for all elements.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `p` of length `n` with all elements set to -1. This changes the state of the variable `p`. All other variables (`n`, `i`, `mex`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
