Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `i` is `n - 3`; `mex` is updated to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. Since `i` is defined as `n - 3`, the value of `i` remains unchanged. The value of `p[i]` is defined as `mex - a[i]`, but since `a[i]` is not mentioned in the initial state, it remains part of the expression for `p[i]`. Therefore, `mex` is updated, but the exact value of `mex` depends on its current value and `p[i]`.
