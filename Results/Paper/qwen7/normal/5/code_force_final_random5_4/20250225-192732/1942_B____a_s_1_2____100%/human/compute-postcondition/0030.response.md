Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `i` is -1; `mex` is updated to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[-1]`; `p[-1]` is `mex - a[-1]`; `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `p[i]` to `mex - a[i]`. Given the initial state, `i` is -1, so `p[i]` becomes `p[-1]`, which is already defined as `mex - a[-1]`. Therefore, `p[-1]` remains unchanged, and `p[-1]` is still `mex - a[-1]`. All other conditions and values remain as they were initially.
