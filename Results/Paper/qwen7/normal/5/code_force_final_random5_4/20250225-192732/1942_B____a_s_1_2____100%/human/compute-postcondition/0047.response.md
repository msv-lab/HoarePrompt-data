Output State: **`i` is `n-2`; `n` remains unchanged; `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`**.

This means that after executing the line of code `p[i] = mex - a[i]`, the value of `i` is set to `n-2`, and the value of `p[i]` is updated to `mex - a[i]`. The value of `n` remains unchanged from its previous state, and the condition `i >= 0` still holds true since `i` is set to `n-2`.
