Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5; `a` is a list of `n` integers such that -`n` ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`, and there exists at least one valid permutation `p` that satisfies the given conditions.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    p = [-1] * n
    mex = n
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        p[i] = mex - a[i]
        mex = min(mex, p[i])
    print(*p)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `i` is `0`; `mex` is updated to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[0]`; `p[i]` is now `mex - a[i]` for all `i` in the range of `n`.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `n` will still be an integer greater than or equal to 1. The variable `i` will be 0 because the loop has completed all its iterations, starting from `n-1` and decrementing by 1 until it reaches 0. The variable `mex` will be the smallest value among all elements in the list `p`. Each element `p[i]` will be calculated as `mex - a[i]` for every index `i` from 0 to `n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is -1, `mex` is the minimum value obtained by iterating through the loop and updating `p[i]` to `mex - a[i]` for each `i` in the range of `n`, and `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]` for all `i` in the range of `n`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `n` remains greater than 0, `i` becomes -1 indicating the end of the loop, `mex` is updated to be the smallest value among all `p[i]` where `p[i] = mex - a[i]` for each `i` from `n-1` down to 0, and the list `p` is fully updated such that each `p[i]` equals `mex - a[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be `-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `n` will remain unchanged, meaning it still holds the initial value of the input integer. The variable `mex` will be updated to the minimum value found among all elements in the list `p`. Each element `p[i]` will be equal to `mex - a[i]` for all valid indices `i`. The list `p` will have been modified according to the operations performed within the loop, with `mex` being adjusted in each iteration to ensure it reflects the smallest possible value that is not present in the list `p` as per the definition of the Mex function (the smallest non-negative integer not in the list).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
