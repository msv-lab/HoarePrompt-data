Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0; `i` is -1; `mex` is the minimum of `mex` and `p[-1]`; `p[-1]` is `mex - a[-1]`; `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. Given that `i` is -1, `p[i]` is `p[-1]`. So, `mex` is updated to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[-1]`, which is already defined as `mex - a[-1]`. Therefore, `mex` remains unchanged because it is already the minimum value between itself and `p[-1]`. All other variables remain in their original state.
