Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n)`. This means the loop variables involved are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n`.

3. **Determine the State After the Previous Iteration**:
   - The output state after the loop executes all iterations indicates that the loop has completed its execution. This means that the condition `i < n` was no longer true at the end of the last iteration.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop has completed, `i` will be equal to `n` at the end of the last iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < n` must be true again. Therefore, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `i + 1`.
   - However, since the loop has already completed, `i` cannot be incremented further within this context. Instead, `n` must be increased by 1 to allow the loop to execute one more time.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - The variable `i` will be set to `n` (since it reached the end of the range).
   - To allow the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be increased by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than `n`**
