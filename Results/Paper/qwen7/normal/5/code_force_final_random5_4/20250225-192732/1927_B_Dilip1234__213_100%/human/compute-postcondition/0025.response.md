Output State: **`j` is 0; `s` is 'a'; `char_count[0]` equals `a[i]`**

Explanation: The code `s += chr(j + ord('a'))` appends a character to the string `s`. Here, `j` is 0, so `chr(j + ord('a'))` becomes `chr(0 + ord('a'))`, which is `chr(97)`, resulting in the character 'a'. Therefore, `s` is updated to include 'a'. The value of `j` remains unchanged, and `char_count[0]` is still equal to `a[i]`.
