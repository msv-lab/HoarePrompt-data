Output State: **`res` is updated by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` to its current value, and `total_count` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `res` by adding the value of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` to its current value. The variable `total_count` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`, which remains unchanged by this operation.
