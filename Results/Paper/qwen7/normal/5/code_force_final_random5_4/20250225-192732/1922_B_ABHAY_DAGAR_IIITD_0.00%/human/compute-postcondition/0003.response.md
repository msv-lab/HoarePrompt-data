Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, results is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `num_list = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer, storing the resulting list in `num_list`. The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
