Output State: **`total_count` is `cnt`, `cnt` is the first value from `num_of_lens.values()`, and `res` is updated as follows: if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is set to `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` remains unchanged; `res` is further updated by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to its current value.**

Explanation:
- The line `total_count += cnt` increments `total_count` by the value of `cnt`.
- The value of `cnt` remains the same as the first value from `num_of_lens.values()`.
- The value of `res` is updated based on the conditions given. Since `cnt` was used to update `res` before this line, and no new value for `cnt` or `res` is provided, the conditions for updating `res` remain the same.
