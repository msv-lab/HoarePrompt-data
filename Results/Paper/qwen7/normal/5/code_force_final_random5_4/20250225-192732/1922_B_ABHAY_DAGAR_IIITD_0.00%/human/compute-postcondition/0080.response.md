Output State: **`total_count` is 0, `res` is 0, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with counts of each integer from `num_list`, `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`, `test_cases` is less than or equal to 0, `results` retains its initial state, `num_list` remains unchanged, and `x` is the last element of `num_list` processed by the loop.**

Explanation: The line `total_count = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `total_count`. This updates the value of `total_count` but does not affect any other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the other variables retain their initial states.
