Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the key `x` (the second element in `num_list`) is set to 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `num_of_lens[x] = 1` sets the value of the key `x` (which is the second element in `num_list`) in the dictionary `num_of_lens` to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
