Output State: **`total_count` is increased by `cnt`, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` must contain at least one key-value pair, and `res` remains 0 if `cnt` is less than 2. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is set to `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) * (`cnt` - 2) // 6.**

This means that the `total_count` variable has been incremented by the value of `cnt`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
