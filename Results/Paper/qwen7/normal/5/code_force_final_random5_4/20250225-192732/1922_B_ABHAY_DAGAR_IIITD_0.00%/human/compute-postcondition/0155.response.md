Output State: **`total_count` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()` plus `cnt_next`, `res` is updated by adding `cnt_next * (cnt_next - 1) * (cnt_next - 2) // 6` to its current value if `cnt_next` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` is updated by adding `cnt_next * (cnt_next - 1) * total_count // 2` to its current value if `cnt_next` is greater than or equal to 2, and `res` remains unchanged if `cnt_next` is less than 2.**

In more detail:
- `total_count` remains the same as it was in the initial state because the code does not directly modify `total_count`.
- `res` is updated based on the value of `cnt_next`:
  - If `cnt_next >= 3`, `res` is increased by `cnt_next * (cnt_next - 1) * (cnt_next - 2) // 6`.
  - If `cnt_next >= 2`, `res` is increased by `cnt_next * (cnt_next - 1) * total_count // 2`.
  - If `cnt_next < 2`, `res` remains unchanged.

This output state reflects the changes made to `res` and maintains the unchanged state of `total_count`.
