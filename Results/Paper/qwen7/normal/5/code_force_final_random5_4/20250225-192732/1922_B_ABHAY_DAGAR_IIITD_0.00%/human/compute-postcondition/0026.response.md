Output State: **`total_count` is 0, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key from `num_list` either has its value incremented by 1 or is set to 1, depending on whether the key is already present in `num_of_lens`, `res` is 0.**

The code initializes `total_count` to 0. This does not affect the values of `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `num_list`, `num_of_lens`, or `res`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
