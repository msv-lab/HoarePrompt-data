Output State: **`total_count` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()` plus `cnt`, and `res` is updated by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` to its current value if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) * total_count // 2` to its current value. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `total_count += cnt` increments `total_count` by the value of `cnt`. The conditions for updating `res` remain unchanged, meaning if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is updated by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` to its current value. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) * total_count // 2` to its current value. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged. The value of `total_count` is now the next value in `num_of_lens.values()` plus the original value of `cnt`.
