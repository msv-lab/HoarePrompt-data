Postcondition: `total_count` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()` plus `cnt_next`, and `res` is updated by adding `cnt_next * (cnt_next - 1) * (cnt_next - 2) // 6` to its current value if `cnt_next` is greater than or equal to 3, otherwise `res` is updated by adding `cnt_next * (cnt_next - 1) * total_count // 2` to its current value if `cnt_next` is greater than or equal to 2, and `res` remains unchanged if `cnt_next` is less than 2.
