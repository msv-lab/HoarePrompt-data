The code `num_of_lens[x] = 1` increments the count of `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` to 1. This means that if `x` was not already a key in `num_of_lens`, it is added with a value of 1. If `x` was already a key, its value is incremented by 1. However, since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `x` or the contents of `num_of_lens`, we can only say that `x` is a key in `num_of_lens` with a value of 1.

The other variables (`res`, `total_count`, `results`, `n`, `num_list`, and `x`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`num_of_lens` is a dictionary where `x` is a key with a value of 1, `res` is the sum of all values calculated according to the conditions within the loop for each `x` in `num_list` and the new `num_list`, `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` and the new `num_of_lens`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers updated with integers from the input split and mapped to integers (excluding the first element), and `x` is the second element in the updated `num_list`.**
