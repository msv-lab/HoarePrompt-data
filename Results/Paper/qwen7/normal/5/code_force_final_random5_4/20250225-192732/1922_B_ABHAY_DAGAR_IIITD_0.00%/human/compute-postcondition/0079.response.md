Output State: **`res` is 0, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with counts of each integer from `num_list`, `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`, `test_cases` is less than or equal to 0, `results` retains its initial state, `num_list` remains unchanged, and `x` is the last element of `num_list` processed by the loop.**

Explanation: The code simply initializes `res` to 0. No changes are made to `num_of_lens`, `total_count`, `test_cases`, `results`, `num_list`, or `x`. Since `test_cases` is decremented by 1 for each iteration and starts from a positive value, after all iterations, `test_cases` will be less than or equal to 0. The values of `num_of_lens` and `total_count` remain as they were after the loop's execution, with `num_of_lens` containing the count of each integer in `num_list` and `total_count` being the sum of these counts. `results` retains its initial state, `num_list` remains the same list of integers provided as input, and `x` is the last element of `num_list` processed by the loop.
