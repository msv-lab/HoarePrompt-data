Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for cnt in num_of_lens.values()`. The variables involved here are `cnt` and `num_of_lens`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `cnt` will take the values from `num_of_lens.values()`.
   - `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains counts of each integer from `num_list`.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `num_of_lens` must contain at least one value (i.e., there must be at least one key-value pair in `num_of_lens`).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `num_of_lens` is a dictionary, it must have at least one key-value pair for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `cnt` will take the first value from `num_of_lens.values()`.

5. **Initial state of other variables**:
   - `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`, but this is not directly relevant to the loop condition.
   - `res` is 0, which is not directly relevant to the loop condition.
   - `test_cases` is less than or equal to 0, which is not directly relevant to the loop condition.
   - `results` retains its initial state, which is not directly relevant to the loop condition.
   - `num_list` remains unchanged, which is not directly relevant to the loop condition.
   - `x` is the last element of `num_list` processed by the loop, which is not directly relevant to the loop condition.

Based on the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `num_of_lens` to ensure it has at least one key-value pair.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair**
