Output State: **`num_of_lens[5]` is incremented by 1, `test_cases` is decremented by 1**.

The code `num_of_lens[x] += 1` increments the value of `num_of_lens` at index `x` by 1. Since `x` is not specified, we assume it is 5 based on the initial state. Therefore, `num_of_lens[5]` is incremented by 1. Additionally, the code `test_cases -= 1` decrements the value of `test_cases` by 1. The states of `total_count`, `res`, `results`, and `num_list` remain unchanged.
