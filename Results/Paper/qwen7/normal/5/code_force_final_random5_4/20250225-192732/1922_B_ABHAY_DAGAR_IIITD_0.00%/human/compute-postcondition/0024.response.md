Output State: `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key from `num_list` either has its value incremented by 1 or is set to 1, depending on whether the key is already present in `num_of_lens`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `num_of_lens` will contain each unique number from `num_list` as a key, with the corresponding value being the count of how many times that number appears in `num_list`. The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial or previous states.
