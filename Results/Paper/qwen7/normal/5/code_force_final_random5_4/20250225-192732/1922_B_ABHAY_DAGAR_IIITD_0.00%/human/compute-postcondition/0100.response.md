Output State: **`num_of_lens` remains unchanged, `cnt` is now the next value in `num_of_lens` that is greater than or equal to 3 after the calculation, `res` is increased by cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `res` by adding the value of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` to it. Here, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens` that is greater than or equal to 3. After this operation, `cnt` remains the same as it was before the calculation, but its value is used in the calculation. The value of `res` is updated accordingly. The list `num_of_lens` remains unchanged.
