Output State: **`total_count` is 0, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` must contain at least one key-value pair, and `res` is 0.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `res` by adding to it the product of `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. However, since `total_count` is 0, the entire expression evaluates to 0. Therefore, `res` remains unchanged at 0. All other variables retain their initial states.
