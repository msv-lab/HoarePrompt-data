Postcondition: `total_count` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()` plus `cnt_next`, and `res` is updated according to the following rules: if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to its current value. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged.
