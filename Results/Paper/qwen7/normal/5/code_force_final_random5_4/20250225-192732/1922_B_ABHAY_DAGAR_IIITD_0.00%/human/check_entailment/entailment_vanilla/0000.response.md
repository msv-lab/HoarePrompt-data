### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to count the number of ways to choose 3 sticks such that they can form a non-degenerate triangle.
   - For three lengths \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) to form a triangle, the triangle inequality must hold: \(a + b > c\), \(a + c > b\), and \(b + c > a\).
   - Given that the length of each stick is \(2^{a_i}\), the triangle inequality simplifies to checking if the sum of the two smaller lengths is greater than the largest length.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the list of exponents `a_i`.
   - It uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count occurrences of each exponent value.
   - The variable `res` is used to store the number of valid triplets.
   - The logic inside the loop:
     - If there are at least 3 sticks with the same length, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 out of these sticks using combinations.
     - If there are at least 2 sticks with the same length, it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 out of these sticks and multiply by the number of ways to choose the third stick from the remaining counts.
     - It updates the total count of sticks seen so far.

3. **Checking the Triangle Inequality:**
   - The provided code does not explicitly check the triangle inequality condition. Instead, it assumes that if there are enough sticks of the same length, they can form a triangle, which is not always true. For example, having three sticks of length \(2^3\) (i.e., 8) will not form a triangle because \(8 + 8 \not> 8\).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The code does not correctly implement the logic to ensure the triangle inequality condition is met.
   - Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
