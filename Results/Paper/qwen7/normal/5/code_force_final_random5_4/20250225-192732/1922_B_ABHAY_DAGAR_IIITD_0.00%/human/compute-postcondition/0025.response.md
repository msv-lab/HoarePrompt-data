Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key from `num_list` either has its value incremented by 1 or is set to 1, depending on whether the key is already present in `num_of_lens`, `res` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `res = 0` initializes the variable `res` to 0. This does not affect the values of `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `num_list`, or `num_of_lens`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial or previously calculated states.
