Output State: **`total_count` is increased by `cnt`, `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` must contain at least one key-value pair, and `res` is updated to `res` + `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) * (`cnt` - 2) // 6 + `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) // 2 * `total_count` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2.**

Explanation: The code `total_count += cnt` increases the value of `total_count` by the current value of `cnt`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. The condition for updating `res` remains the same, but since `cnt` is now incremented by its original value, the expression for `res` will be evaluated with the new value of `cnt`.
