Output State: **`total_count` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()` plus `cnt_next`, and `res` is updated by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to its current value.**

Explanation: The code updates `res` by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to its current value. Here, `cnt` is used instead of `cnt_next` because the code snippet does not specify which `cnt` to use, and typically in such contexts, the current count (`cnt`) is used. The value of `total_count` remains as the next value in `num_of_lens.values()` plus `cnt_next`. The other variables remain unchanged.
