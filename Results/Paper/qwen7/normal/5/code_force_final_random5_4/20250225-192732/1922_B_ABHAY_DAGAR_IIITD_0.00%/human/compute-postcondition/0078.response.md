Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `num_of_lens` will be a dictionary where each key is an integer from the `num_list` and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`. `total_count` will be the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`. `res`, `test_cases`, `results`, `num_list`, and `x` will retain their properties as described in the initial state, with `test_cases` being less than or equal to 0 (since it is decremented by 1 for each iteration and starts from a positive value). The `num_list` will remain the same list of integers provided as input, and `x` will be the last element of `num_list` processed by the loop.

In summary, the final state will reflect the frequency count of each integer in the input list `num_list`, with `total_count` representing the total number of elements in `num_list`.
