Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, results is an empty list, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value obtained from `int(input())`, which converts the user's input into an integer. The conditions for `test_cases` and the state of the `results` list remain unchanged.
