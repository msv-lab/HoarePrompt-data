Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `num_of_lens` remains unchanged.
- `cnt` remains greater than or equal to 3.
- `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * (total_count + cnt)`.

### Loop Head:
```python
for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Variable**: The loop variable is `cnt`, which iterates over the values of `num_of_lens`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as there are values in `num_of_lens` that satisfy the condition `cnt >= 3`.

### Adjusting the States:
- Since the loop is iterating over the values of `num_of_lens`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `cnt`.
- `num_of_lens` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
- `res` is updated based on the current value of `cnt`, but since we are determining the state before the update, `res` does not need to be adjusted directly.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Determine the Next Value of `cnt`**: Since `cnt` is iterating over the values of `num_of_lens`, the next value of `cnt` will be the next key in `num_of_lens` that satisfies `cnt >= 3`.
2. **Adjust the State**: We need to ensure that `cnt` is set to the next valid value from `num_of_lens`.

### New State:
Given that `cnt` must remain greater than or equal to 3 and will be the next valid value from `num_of_lens`, the new state should reflect this.

**State:**
**`num_of_lens` remains unchanged, `cnt` must be the next value in `num_of_lens` that is greater than or equal to 3, and `res` remains unchanged.`**

### Final Answer:
State: **`num_of_lens` remains unchanged, `cnt` must be the next value in `num_of_lens` that is greater than or equal to 3, and `res` remains unchanged.**
