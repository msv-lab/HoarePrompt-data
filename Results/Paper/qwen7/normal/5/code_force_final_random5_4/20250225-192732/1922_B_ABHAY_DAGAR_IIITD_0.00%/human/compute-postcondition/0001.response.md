Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables involved in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the variable `test_cases`.

2. **Determine the conditions for loop execution**: The loop will execute as long as `test_cases` is greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the initial state**: Since the loop head involves `test_cases`, we need to ensure that `test_cases` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The variable `results` being an empty list does not affect the loop's execution condition.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `test_cases` is greater than 0.

**Final State**:
State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, results is an empty list**
