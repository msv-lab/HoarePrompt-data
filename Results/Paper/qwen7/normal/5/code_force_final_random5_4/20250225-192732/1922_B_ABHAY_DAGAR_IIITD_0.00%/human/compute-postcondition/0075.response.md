Postcondition: `num_of_lens` and `test_cases` are updated. If `x` is in `num_of_lens`, then `num_of_lens[5]` is incremented by 1 and `test_cases` is decremented by 1. If `x` is not in `num_of_lens`, then `num_of_lens[5]` is set to 2 and `test_cases` is decremented by 1, while `total_count`, `res`, `results`, and `num_list` retain their properties.
