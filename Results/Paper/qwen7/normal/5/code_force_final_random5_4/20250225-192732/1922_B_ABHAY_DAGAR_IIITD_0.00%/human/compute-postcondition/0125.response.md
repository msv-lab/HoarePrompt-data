Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `x` and `num_list`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `num_list`. The variable `x` takes on the value of each element in `num_list` during each iteration.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where `x` is either incremented by 1 if it already exists, or added with a value of 1 if it does not exist.
   - `res` remains unchanged.
   - `total_count` remains unchanged.
   - `results` remains unchanged.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `num_list` is a list of integers updated with integers from the input split and mapped to integers (excluding the first element).
   - `x` is the second element in the updated `num_list`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `x` is the second element in `num_list`, the next element in `num_list` will be the third element.
   - The dictionary `num_of_lens` will be updated based on the new value of `x`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `num_list` will now contain the list excluding the first two elements (since `x` was the second element).
   - `x` will be the third element in the updated `num_list`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `num_list` and `x`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`num_of_lens` is a dictionary where `x` is either incremented by 1 if it already exists, or added with a value of 1 if it does not exist, `res` remains unchanged, `total_count` remains unchanged, `results` remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers updated with integers from the input split and mapped to integers (excluding the first two elements), and `x` is the third element in the updated `num_list`**.
