Based on the initial state provided:

- `results` is a list that must be initialized with the correct values for `res` after each iteration.
- `total_count` is the sum of all values from `num_of_lens.values()` for every iteration.
- `res` is the cumulative result of applying the formulas for each value in `num_of_lens` that meets the conditions across all iterations.

The `print(result)` statement will print the final value of the `results` list, which is the last value assigned to `res` after all iterations have completed.

Since the exact values of `num_of_lens`, the conditions, and the formulas applied are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `res` or `results`.

Therefore, the output will be the final value of the `results` list after all iterations.

Output: **the final value of the results list after all iterations**
