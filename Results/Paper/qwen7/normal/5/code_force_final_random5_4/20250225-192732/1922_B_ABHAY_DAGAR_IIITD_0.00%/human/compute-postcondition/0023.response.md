Output State: `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key from `num_list` is present with a value representing the count of occurrences of that key in `num_list`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `num_of_lens` will contain each unique integer from `num_list` as a key, with the corresponding value being the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`. The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, and `n`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
