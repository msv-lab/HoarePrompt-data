Postcondition: `total_count` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`, and `res` is updated based on the value of `cnt`. Specifically, if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is updated by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` to its current value. If `cnt` is less than 3, `res` remains unchanged.
