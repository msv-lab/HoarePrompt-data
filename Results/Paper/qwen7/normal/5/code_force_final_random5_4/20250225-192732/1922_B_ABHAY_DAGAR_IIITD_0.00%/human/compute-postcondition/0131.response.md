Output State: `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key `x` from the original `num_list` (and any new elements added during the loop) has a corresponding value representing the count of occurrences of `x`. `res` remains the sum of all values calculated according to the conditions within the loop for each `x` in the original `num_list` and any new elements added during the loop. `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` and any new entries added during the loop. `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`. `n` is the input integer provided initially, and `num_list` is a list of integers updated with integers from the input split and mapped to integers (after all iterations of the loop). The variable `x` represents the current element being processed in `num_list` during the last iteration of the loop.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `num_of_lens` will contain the count of each unique number from the original `num_list` and any new numbers added during the loop. `res` will be the total count of all numbers processed, `total_count` will be the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`, `results` will contain the final count of all numbers, `n` will remain unchanged, and `num_list` will be the list of integers after all additions and updates.
