Output State: **`num_of_lens` remains unchanged, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens` that is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is updated to `res` plus `cnt` times (`cnt` minus 1) times (`cnt` minus 2) divided by 6, and `total_count` is increased by `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code `total_count += cnt` increments the value of `total_count` by the current value of `cnt`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
