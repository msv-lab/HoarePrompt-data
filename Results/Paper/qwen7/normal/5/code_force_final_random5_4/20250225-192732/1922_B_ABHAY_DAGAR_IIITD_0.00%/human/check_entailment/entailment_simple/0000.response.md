Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through each test case, calculating the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle, and then printing the results. However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Triangle Formation**: The program calculates the number of ways to form a triangle based on the counts of each unique exponent value in the input. This approach does not correctly determine whether three sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle. Specifically, it does not check the triangle inequality theorem (i.e., the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side).

2. **Incorrect Formula Application**: The program uses combinatorial formulas to count the number of ways to choose sticks without considering the actual lengths of the sticks. For example, the formula `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` is used to count combinations of 3 sticks with the same length, which does not account for the triangle inequality.

3. **Lack of Triangle Inequality Check**: There is no code that checks whether the three sticks with the same or different exponents can actually form a triangle. This is a critical part of the problem's requirements.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
