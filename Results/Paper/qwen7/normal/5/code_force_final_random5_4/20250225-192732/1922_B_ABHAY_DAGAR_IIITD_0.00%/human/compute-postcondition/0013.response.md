Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `test_cases` must be greater than 0.
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the key `x` (the first element in `num_list`) either has its value incremented by 1 or is set to 1, depending on whether `x` is already in `num_of_lens`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `x` in `num_list`.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop iterates over `x` in `num_list`, the only variable that changes with each iteration is `x`.
   - `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, and `num_of_lens` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no such modifications are mentioned, they stay the same.

4. **Next Element in `num_list`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `x` was the first element in `num_list`.
   - For the next iteration, `x` will be the second element in `num_list`.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `test_cases` remains the same as it must still be greater than 0.
   - `results` remains an empty list.
   - `n` remains the same as it is an input integer.
   - `num_of_lens` remains the same unless the second element in `num_list` is different from the first element. However, since no specific action is mentioned for modifying `num_of_lens` based on the second element, we assume it stays the same.

Therefore, the updated states for the next iteration are:

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the key `x` (the second element in `num_list`) either has its value incremented by 1 or is set to 1, depending on whether `x` is already in `num_of_lens`.**
