Output State: **`num_of_lens` remains unchanged, `res` is the sum of all values calculated according to the conditions within the loop for each `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()`, and `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`; `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`.**

Explanation: The code appends the final value of `res` to the list `results`. Since the loop does not modify `num_of_lens`, it remains unchanged. The variable `res` is updated based on the conditions specified in the loop: for each `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` where `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is incremented by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2 but less than 3, `res` is incremented by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. Additionally, `total_count` is incremented by each `cnt` as it goes through the loop. After the loop completes, the final value of `res` is appended to the list `results`.
