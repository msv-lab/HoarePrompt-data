Postcondition: **`num_of_lens`, `total_count`, `res`, `test_cases`, `results`, `num_list`, and `x` retain their properties as described in the precondition. If `x` is found in `num_of_lens`, `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1, and `test_cases` is decremented by 1. If `x` is not found in `num_of_lens`, `num_of_lens[x]` is set to 1, and `test_cases` is also decremented by 1.**
