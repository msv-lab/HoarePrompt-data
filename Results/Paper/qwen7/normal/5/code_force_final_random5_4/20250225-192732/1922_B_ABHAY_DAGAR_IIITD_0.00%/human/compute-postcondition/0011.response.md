Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with one key-value pair `{x: 1}`, `x` is the first element in `num_list`, and `x` is not in `num_of_lens`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value 1 to `num_of_lens[x]`. Since `x` was already present in `num_list` and was not in `num_of_lens`, this assignment updates the dictionary `num_of_lens` to include the key-value pair `{x: 1}`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
