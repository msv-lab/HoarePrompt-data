Output State: **`num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `res` is the sum of all values calculated according to the conditions within the loop for each `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` and the new `num_list`, `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` and the new `num_of_lens`, and `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`. `n` is an input integer, and `num_list` is updated with integers from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty dictionary `num_of_lens`. The values of `res`, `total_count`, `results`, `n`, and `num_list` remain unchanged from their initial states as no operations are performed on them within the given code snippet.
