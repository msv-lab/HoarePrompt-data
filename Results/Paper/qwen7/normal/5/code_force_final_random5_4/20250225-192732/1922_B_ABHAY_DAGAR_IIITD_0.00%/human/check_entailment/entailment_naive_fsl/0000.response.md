Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. The program counts combinations of sticks based on their occurrence counts but does not check the triangle inequality theorem, which states that for three lengths to form a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
3
0 1 1
```

The program would output `3` because it counts the combinations of sticks based on their occurrences, but the valid combinations are only `(2^0, 2^1, 2^1)` which forms a degenerate triangle (area = 0), not a non-degenerate triangle. There are no valid non-degenerate triangles that can be formed from these sticks.

To fix this, the program needs to check the triangle inequality theorem after counting the occurrences of each stick length.
