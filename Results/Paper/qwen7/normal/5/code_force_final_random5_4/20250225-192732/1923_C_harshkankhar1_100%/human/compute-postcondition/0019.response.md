Output State: **`x` is an integer from the first input split, `y` is an integer from the second input split, `q` is decremented by 1**.

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input, splits them based on whitespace, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `x` and `y` respectively. The value of `q` is decremented by 1 but its initial value was not specified, so it remains as "decremented by 1". The initial values of `x` and `y` are now specific integers obtained from the input.
