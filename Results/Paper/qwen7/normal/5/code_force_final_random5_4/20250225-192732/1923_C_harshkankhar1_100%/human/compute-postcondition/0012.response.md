Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `c` is an array of length `n` where each element is a positive integer not exceeding \(10^9\), `a` is an array of length `n+1` where `a[0]` is 0 and the rest of the elements are the integers inputted separated by spaces, `b` is an array of length `n+1` where `b[0]` is 0 and `b[i]` is the sum of `x` from `i=1` to `i=n+1`, `i` is `n+1`, `x` is 1 if `a[n]` > 1 else 2.

In this final state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be `n+1`. The variable `x` will be determined by the condition `1` if `a[n]` > 1 else `2`. The array `b` will contain `b[0]` as `0` and each subsequent element `b[i]` will be the cumulative sum of `x` values from `i=1` to `i=n+1`.
