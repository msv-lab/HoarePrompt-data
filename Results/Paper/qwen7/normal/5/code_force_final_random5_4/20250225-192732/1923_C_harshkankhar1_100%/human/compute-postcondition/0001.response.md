Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `c` is an array of length `n` where each element is a positive integer not exceeding 10^9, `a` is an array of length `n+1` where `a[0]` is 0 and the rest of the elements are the integers inputted separated by spaces.**

Explanation: The code initializes an array `a` with a length of `n+1`. It sets `a[0]` to 0 and fills the rest of the array with integers from the input separated by spaces. The initial values of `t`, `n`, `q`, and `c` remain unchanged.
