Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `c` is an array of length `n` where each element is a positive integer not exceeding \(10^9\), `a` is an array of length `n+1` where `a[0]` is 0 and the rest of the elements are the cumulative sums of the integers inputted separated by spaces, `b` is an array of length `n+1` where `b[0]` is 0 and `b[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n+1` is the sum of `x` for each iteration of the loop, `i` is `n+1`, `x` is 1 if `a[n]` > 1 else 2.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES'
        )


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is an integer from the first input split, `y` is an integer from the second input split, the output is 'NO' if a[y] - a[x - 1] is less than b[y] - b[x - 1] or x is equal to y, otherwise the output is 'YES'

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` is an integer from the first input split, `y` is an integer from the second input split, `q` is decremented by 1, the program prints 'NO' if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y, otherwise it prints 'YES'

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `x` is an integer from the first input split, `y` is an integer from the second input split, `q` is decremented by 1, a string 'NO' is printed if a[y] - a[x - 1] is less than b[y] - b[x - 1] or x equals y, otherwise a string 'YES' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
