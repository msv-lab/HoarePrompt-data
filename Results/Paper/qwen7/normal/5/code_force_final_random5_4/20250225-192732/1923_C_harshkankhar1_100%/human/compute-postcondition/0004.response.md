Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `c` is an array of length `n` where each element is a positive integer not exceeding 10^9, `a` is an array of length `n+1` where `a[0]` is 0 and the rest of the elements are the integers inputted separated by spaces, `b` is an array of length `n+1` where each element is 0, `i` is 2, `x` is 1 if `a[1]` > 1 else 2.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `x` based on whether `a[i]` (which is `a[1]` since `i` is initially 1) is greater than 1. If `a[1]` is greater than 1, `x` is set to 1; otherwise, `x` is set to 2. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
