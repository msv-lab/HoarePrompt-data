State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `c` is an array of length `n` where each element is a positive integer not exceeding 10^9, `a` is an array of length `n+1` where `a[0]` is 0 and the rest of the elements are the integers inputted separated by spaces, `b` is an array of length `n+1` where each element is 0, `i` is 1, `i` must be less than or equal to `n+1`**

Explanation:
- The loop runs from `1` to `n+1`.
- The variable `i` starts at `1` and will increment until it reaches `n+1`.
- For the loop to execute, `i` must be within the range `[1, n+1)`, meaning `i` should be less than or equal to `n+1`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `i` is set to `1` and that `i` is less than or equal to `n+1`.
