Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, with `q` being fully decremented to 0. For each iteration, based on the inputs `x` and `y`, the program prints either 'NO' or 'YES'. The final output consists of 'NO' or 'YES' printed for each of the `q` iterations, depending on whether the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] >= b[y] - b[x - 1]` and `x != y` holds true for each pair of inputs.

The values of `t`, `n`, `c`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial or previous states after the loop completes.
