You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, each test case contains two integers n and q where 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5, an array c of length n where each element is a positive integer not exceeding 10^9, and q subarray queries defined by pairs of integers l_i and r_i where 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `c` is an array of length `n` where each element is a positive integer not exceeding \(10^9\), `a` is an array of length `n+1` where `a[0]` is 0 and the rest of the elements are the integers inputted separated by spaces, `b` is an array of length `n+1` where `b[0]` is 0 and `b[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n+1` is the sum of `x` for each iteration of the loop, `i` is `n+1`, `x` is 1 if `a[n]` > 1 else 2.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n+1` because the loop runs from `1` to `n`. The value of `x` will be determined by checking if `a[n]` is greater than 1 or not. The array `b` will have its last element `b[n]` as the sum of all `x` values calculated during each iteration of the loop. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, `a`) will retain their initial or unchanged states as they are not modified within the loop.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `q` is 0, and the loop has completed all its iterations. For each iteration, based on the conditions provided, either 'NO' or 'YES' was printed depending on whether `a[y] - a[x - 1]` is less than `b[y] - b[x - 1]` or if `x` equals `y`. After the loop completes, there will be no further inputs or outputs, and the program terminates.
    #
    #In more detail, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `q` which initially counted the number of iterations, is now 0. The loop has processed all its inputs, and for each input pair `(x, y)`, it printed 'NO' if the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y` was met, otherwise it printed 'YES'. The arrays `a` and `b` have been updated according to the loop's logic, but their exact values are not specified in the problem statement beyond their initial conditions and the operations performed within the loop. The variables `x` and `y` used in the loop are no longer relevant as the loop has ended.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of inputs including a positive integer `t`, an integer `n`, an integer `q`, an array `c` of length `n` containing positive integers not exceeding 10^9, and `q` subarray queries defined by pairs of integers `l_i` and `r_i` where 1 <= `l_i` <= `r_i` <= `n`. For each query, it returns the sum of elements in the subarray from index `l_i` to `r_i`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
