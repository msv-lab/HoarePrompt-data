Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(1, n):` will start from `i = 1` and go up to `n-1`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1 (since the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`, if `n` is 1 or less, the loop won't execute).

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - The variable `i` will start from 1, so we don't need to explicitly set it; the loop will handle this.
   - The variable `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the initial states:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `line` is the string input by the user.
- `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `line` by spaces and converting each part to an integer.
- `a` is a list containing the integer 1000.

We only need to adjust the state of `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final State**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1**
