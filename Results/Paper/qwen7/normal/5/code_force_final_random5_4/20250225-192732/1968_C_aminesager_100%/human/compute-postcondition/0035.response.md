Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list with `n` elements where each element `a[j]` (for `j` from 0 to `n-1`) is equal to the sum of the first `j+1` elements of `T` plus `a[0] + T[0]`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, `t` is `t-1` and is still truthy (non-zero)**.

Explanation: The variable `t` is decremented by 1, making it `t-1`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, `result`, and the condition of `t` being truthy) remain unchanged.
