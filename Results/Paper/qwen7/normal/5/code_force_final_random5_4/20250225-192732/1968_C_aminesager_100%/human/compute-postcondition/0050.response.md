Output State: The list `a` will contain `n` elements where each element `a[j]` (for `j` from 0 to `n-1`) is equal to the sum of the first `j+1` elements of `T` plus `a[0] + T[0]`. The value of `n` will be the input integer provided when `t` was initially set to a positive integer. The variable `result` will be a space-separated string of elements from list `a`. The variable `t` will eventually become 0 after all iterations of the loop are completed, making the loop terminate. The variable `line` will remain as the original input entered by the user after the last iteration of the loop.
