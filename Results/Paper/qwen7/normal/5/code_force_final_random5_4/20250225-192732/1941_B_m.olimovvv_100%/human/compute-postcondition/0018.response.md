Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` must be greater than 4, and `i` is 2; `b[i + 1]` is decreased by `2 * b[i]`**.

Explanation: The code `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2` modifies the value of `b[i + 1]` by subtracting twice the value of `b[i]` from it. Given that `i` is 2, `b[i + 1]` refers to `b[3]`. Therefore, `b[3]` is updated to its current value minus twice the value of `b[2]`. The conditions and values of `t`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.
