Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is greater than 5, `i` is 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `a`, or `i`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Since no variables are reassigned or modified by the `break` statement, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
