Output State: **`b` is a list of integers, the current value of `b[i]` is less than 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block provided in the code snippet, the only effect is that the execution will break out of the most internal loop or if statement that it was inside. The values of the variables `b` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
