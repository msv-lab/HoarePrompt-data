Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program checks if any element in the array is negative after performing the operations and immediately prints 'NO' if it finds a negative element. However, this approach is flawed because it does not ensure that all elements can be reduced to zero.

To illustrate, consider the following input:
```
5
1 3 5 5 2
```
The program will check the array and find that `b[0]` is 1, which is not negative, so it will proceed to the next elements. It will then attempt to perform the operations, but it does not correctly handle the scenario where the operations might lead to a state where not all elements can be reduced to zero.

A correct approach would involve ensuring that the sum of the array elements is even (since each operation reduces the sum by 3), and then checking if it's possible to balance the array such that all elements can be reduced to zero through the specified operations. The current implementation fails to account for these necessary conditions.
