Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `a`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `a - 2`. 

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `b[i]` is 0.
   - `b[i + 1]` is decreased by `2 * b[i]`.
   - `b[i + 2]` is decreased by `b[i]`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `b[i]` is 0, the values of `b[i + 1]` and `b[i + 2]` remain unchanged from the previous iteration because `2 * b[i]` and `b[i]` are both 0.
   - The variable `i` needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `a` remains the same.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 1]` is decreased by `2 * b[i]`, `b[i + 2]` is decreased by `b[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`**.
