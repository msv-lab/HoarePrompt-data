Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `b[i + 1]` is `b[i + 1] - 2 * b[i]`, `b[i]` is `0`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `b[i + 1]` by subtracting twice the value of `b[i]` from it. Given that `b[i]` is `0`, the expression `b[i + 1] - b[i] * 2` simplifies to `b[i + 1] - 0 * 2`, which further simplifies to just `b[i + 1]`. Therefore, `b[i + 1]` is updated by subtracting `2 * b[i]`, which is `0`, from its original value. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
