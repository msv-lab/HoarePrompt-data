Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is greater than 4, and `i` is 2; `b[i + 2]` is decreased by `2 * b[i]`**

Explanation: The code `b[i + 2] -= b[i]` decreases the value of `b[i + 2]` by `2 * b[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, this translates to decreasing `b[4]` by `2 * b[2]`. The initial conditions for `t`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.
