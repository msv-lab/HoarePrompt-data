Reasoning:
1. The provided program consists of a main loop that processes each test case.
2. For each test case, it calls `func_1(arr)` with the array and prints the result.
3. The function `func_1(arr)` aims to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation.
4. The logic in `func_1(arr)`:
   - Initializes `i` to 0 and `j` to the last index of the array.
   - Skips consecutive identical elements from the start (`i`).
   - Skips consecutive identical elements from the end (`j`).
   - Checks if the first and last elements are the same.
     - If true, it returns the maximum value between 0 and the difference between `j` and `i` minus one.
     - If false, it returns the maximum value between the minimum of (the length of `arr` minus `i` minus 1) and `j`, and 0.

5. The logic in `func_1(arr)` does not fully address the problem requirements:
   - It only handles the case where the entire array can be made uniform by setting all elements to the first or last element.
   - It does not consider other possible segments within the array that could be set to a common value to minimize the cost.

Given the provided execution summary, the function's logic is incomplete and does not cover all necessary scenarios to solve the problem correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
