Output State: **The value of `i` is the length of `arr`, `j` is 0, and all elements in `arr` are identical.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `j` will eventually reach 0 because the loop continues to decrement `j` as long as `j > 0` and the current element is equal to the previous one. Since the loop stops when `j` is no longer greater than 0, it means all elements in `arr` from index 0 to `i-1` (which is the entire array) must be identical. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of `arr` because the loop processes all elements assuming they are consecutive duplicates.
