Reasoning:

1. **Function Logic Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to find the minimum cost to make all elements in the array equal using at most one operation.
   - The function first checks if all elements in the array are already equal (`arr[0] == arr[-1]`). If so, it calculates the cost of making all elements equal by setting them to the value of the first element. This cost is calculated as the length of the array minus 1 because only one operation is needed to set all elements to the first element's value.
   - If not all elements are equal, it calculates the minimum cost required to make all elements equal by considering two scenarios:
     - Setting all elements from the start to some point to the first element.
     - Setting all elements from some point to the end to the last element.
   - The function correctly handles the edge cases and ensures that the minimum cost is returned.

2. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The function correctly handles arrays where all elements are already equal, returning 0.
   - The function correctly handles arrays where not all elements are equal, calculating the minimum cost accurately.
   - The constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) are respected by the logic implemented.

3. **Input/Output Handling**:
   - The main program correctly reads the input and calls the function `func_1` for each test case.
   - The function returns the correct output for each test case as per the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the function `func_1` and the main program logic appear to be correct based on the provided problem description and examples.

Correctness: **True**
