Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify the Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is given by:
   ```
   while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
   ```

2. **Current States:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `j` is the length of `arr` - 1
   - `arr[0]` must be equal to `arr[1]`

3. **Loop Head Variables:**
   The variables in the loop head are `i` and the condition involving `arr`.

4. **Determine the Next Iteration Condition:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, both conditions in the `while` statement must be true.
   - The first condition `i < len(arr) - 1` should hold true.
   - The second condition `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` should hold true.

5. **Check Current Values:**
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - To satisfy `i < len(arr) - 1`, `len(arr)` must be greater than 2 (since `i` is 1, `len(arr) - 1` must be greater than 1).
   - To satisfy `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`, `arr[1]` must be equal to `arr[2]`.

6. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since `i` is already 1, we need to ensure `len(arr)` is greater than 2.
   - We also need to ensure `arr[1] == arr[2]`.

### Final State Adjustment

Based on the above analysis, we need to adjust the following states:
- Ensure `len(arr)` is greater than 2.
- Ensure `arr[1] == arr[2]`.

### Final Answer

State: **`i` is 1, `j` is the length of `arr` - 1, `arr[0]` must be equal to `arr[1]`, `len(arr)` must be greater than 2, and `arr[1]` must be equal to `arr[2]`**
