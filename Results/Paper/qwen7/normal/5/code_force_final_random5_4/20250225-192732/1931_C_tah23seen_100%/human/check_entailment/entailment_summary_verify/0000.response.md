### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function `func_1` in detail to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to make all elements of the array equal by performing at most one operation where we can set a subarray to a single value. The cost of this operation is the length of the subarray. We need to find the minimum cost to achieve this.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
The function `func_1` has the following logic:
1. It initializes two pointers `i` and `j` to the start and end of the array, respectively.
2. It checks if all elements in the array are the same by comparing `arr[0]` with `arr[-1]`.
3. If they are the same, it calculates the maximum value between 0 and the difference between `j` and `i` minus one.
4. If they are not the same, it returns the maximum value between the minimum of (the length of `arr` minus `i` minus 1) and `j`, and 0.

This logic does not cover all possible scenarios for minimizing the cost. For instance, consider the test case `[2, 1, 1, 2]`. The correct solution involves setting the entire array to either 1 or 2, which would cost 3 burles. However, the current implementation might only consider setting the prefix or suffix, leading to an incorrect result.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we should use dynamic programming or a more thorough exploration of all possible segmentations. The function `func_1` does not explore all possible segmentations and thus cannot guarantee the minimum cost.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal. The function `func_1` does not handle all cases correctly and does not explore all possible segmentations to ensure the minimum cost is found.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible segmentations to find the minimum cost.
