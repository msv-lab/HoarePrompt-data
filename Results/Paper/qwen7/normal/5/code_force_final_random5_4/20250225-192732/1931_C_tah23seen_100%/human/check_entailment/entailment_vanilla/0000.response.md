Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It calls the function `func_1` to compute the result and prints it.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function takes an array `arr` as input.
   - It initializes two pointers `i` and `j` to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - It uses a while loop to skip consecutive identical elements from the start (`i`).
   - Another while loop skips consecutive identical elements from the end (`j`).
   - It checks if the first and last elements are the same. If they are, it returns the maximum of `j - i - 1` and 0.
   - Otherwise, it returns the maximum of the minimum cost to make all elements from the start to `j` equal and the minimum cost to make all elements from `i` to the end equal.

### Issues in the Function `func_1`:
1. **Logic for Finding Minimum Cost:**
   - The logic to find the minimum cost to make all elements from the start to `j` equal or from `i` to the end equal is flawed.
   - The current implementation does not correctly calculate the cost of making all elements equal using the allowed operation.
   - The function should identify the most frequent element in the array and calculate the cost of making all other elements equal to this most frequent element.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The cost of making all elements from `i` to `j` equal to a particular value `x` is `(j - i + 1)` burles.
   - The function should iterate through the array to find the most frequent element and then calculate the cost of making all other elements equal to this most frequent element.

### Correct Implementation:
Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func_1(arr):
    # Count the frequency of each element
    freq = Counter(arr)
    # Find the most frequent element
    most_common_element, _ = freq.most_common(1)[0]
    
    min_cost = float('inf')
    current_cost = 0
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] != most_common_element:
            current_cost += 1
        else:
            min_cost = min(min_cost, current_cost)
            current_cost = 0
    
    # Add the cost for the last segment
    min_cost = min(min_cost, current_cost)
    
    return min_cost
```

### Conclusion:
The original function `func_1` is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to make all elements equal using the allowed operation. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
