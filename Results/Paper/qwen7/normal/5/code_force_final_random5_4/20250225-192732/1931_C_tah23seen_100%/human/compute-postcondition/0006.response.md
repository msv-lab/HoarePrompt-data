Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is the length of `arr` - 1, `arr[0]` must be equal to `arr[1]`, `len(arr)` must be greater than 2, and `arr[1]` must be equal to `arr[2]`**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
