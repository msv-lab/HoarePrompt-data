Postcondition: `left` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` must be less than half of `left + 1` or `rightOne` must be less than half of `n - left + 1`. If the character at position `left - 1` in the string `s` is '0', then `leftZero` is decreased by 2, `left` remains greater than 0, `rightZero` is increased by 1, and `rightOne` remains less than half of `n - left + 1`. Otherwise, `left` is decreased by 1, `leftZero` must be less than half of `left + 1`, or `rightOne` is less than half of `n - left + 1`, and the character at position `left - 1` in the string `s` is not '0', `rightOne` is increased by 1.
