Output State: **`left` must be greater than 0 and either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` must still hold true; `rightOne` is `rightOne + 1`.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. The conditions involving `left` and the comparison between `leftZero` and `(left + 1) // 2`, as well as `rightOne` and `(n - left + 1) // 2`, remain unchanged from the initial state.
