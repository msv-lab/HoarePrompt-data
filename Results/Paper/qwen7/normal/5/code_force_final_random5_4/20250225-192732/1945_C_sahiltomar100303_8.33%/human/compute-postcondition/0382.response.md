Output State: **`left` is `n // 2` plus the total number of iterations minus 3 and must be greater than 0, `rightZero` is increased by 1 if `s[left - 1]` was '0', otherwise `rightOne` is increased by 1 and `s[left - 1]` is not '0', and either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` must hold true; `leftOne` is decreased by 1; `rightOne` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `rightOne += 1` increases the value of `rightOne` by 1. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
