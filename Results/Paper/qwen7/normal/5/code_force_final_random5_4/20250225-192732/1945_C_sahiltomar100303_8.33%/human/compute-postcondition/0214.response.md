Output State: **`leftZero` is `leftZero - 2`, `left` must be greater than 0, `rightZero` is `rightZero + 1`, `rightOne` must be less than half of `n - left + 1`.**

Explanation: The code increments `rightZero` by 1. The initial state shows that `leftZero` is `leftZero - 1`, which means `leftZero` was already decremented by 1 before this line of code. After executing `rightZero += 1`, `rightZero` is incremented by 1 again. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
