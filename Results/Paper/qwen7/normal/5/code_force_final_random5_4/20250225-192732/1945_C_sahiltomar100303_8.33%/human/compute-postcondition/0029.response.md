Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The other variable mentioned in the loop condition is `mid`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < mid`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `mid` must be greater than 1.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 2.
   - Since `mid` must remain greater than 1 for the loop to continue, `mid` remains as it was in the previous iteration.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` changes from 1 to 2.
   - `mid` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 1.

5. **Formulate the New State:**
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `mid` must still be greater than 1.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is 2, `mid` must be greater than 1**
