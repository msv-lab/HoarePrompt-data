Postcondition: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or 1, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros in the string from index `left` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is the total number of ones in the string from index `left` to `n-1`, `right` is `mid`, and `rightOne` is less than or equal to half of the remaining length of the string. If `s[right]` is '0', then `leftZero` is 1 and `rightZero` is reduced by 1. Otherwise, `leftZero` remains unchanged.**

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts, considering the condition `s[right] == '0'` and the corresponding changes in the variables.
