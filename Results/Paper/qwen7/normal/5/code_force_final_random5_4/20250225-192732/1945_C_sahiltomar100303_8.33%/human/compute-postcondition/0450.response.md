Postcondition: **`s` is a string, `right` is an index within the string `s` and is not equal to `n`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, `tleftOne` are updated based on the number of '0's and '1's encountered as described. The absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right` if the if condition is true, and the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is greater than the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right` if the else condition is true.**
