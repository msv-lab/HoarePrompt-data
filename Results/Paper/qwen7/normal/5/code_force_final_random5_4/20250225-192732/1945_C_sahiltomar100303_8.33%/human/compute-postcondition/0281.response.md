Postcondition: `left` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or 1, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros in the string from index `left` to `n-1` minus the number of iterations the loop executed, `rightOne` is the total number of ones in the string from index `left` to `n-1` minus the number of iterations the loop executed, `right` is `n`, `trightZero` and `trightOne` are adjusted according to the characters encountered during each iteration of the loop, and `left` is not equal to 0 before the loop but becomes 0 when the condition `right == n` is met.
