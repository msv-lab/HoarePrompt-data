Output State: **`s` is a string, `i` is `i + 2`, `rightZero` is unchanged, `rightOne` is increased by 2**

Explanation: The variable `rightOne` was already increased by 1 in the initial state. The code snippet `trightOne += 1` increases `rightOne` by 1 again, making it increased by 2 in total. The other variables remain unchanged.
