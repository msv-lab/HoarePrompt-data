Output State: **`i` is 1, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 2**

Explanation: The variable `tleftZero` is not present in the initial state, so it is assumed to be a typo and should be `leftZero`. The code increments `leftZero` by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The values of `i` and `mid` remain unchanged.
