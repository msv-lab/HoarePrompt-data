Output State: **`left` is now `(left + 1)`, `leftZero` is such that either `leftZero < (left + 1 + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2`, and `rightZero` is increased by 1 if `s[left - 1] == '0'`, otherwise `rightOne` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `left` is decremented by 1, so `left` is now `(left + 1)`. The conditions involving `leftZero`, `rightOne`, `rightZero`, and the string `s` remain unchanged in their logical form, but `leftZero` and `rightOne` might now satisfy different conditions due to the new value of `left`.
