Postcondition: **`leftMove` is 6, `i` is equal to `n`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `s` is the input string, `leftZero` is the count of '0's from index 0 to `mid - 1` (decreased multiple times or unchanged), `leftOne` is the count of '1's from index 0 to `mid - 1` (decreased multiple times or unchanged), `rightZero` is the count of '0's or '1's from index `mid` to the end of the string (increased multiple times or unchanged), `rightOne` is the count of '0's or '1's from index `mid` to the end of the string (increased multiple times or unchanged), `left` is `mid - 3`, `right` is `mid - 2`, `tleftZero` is less than `(n // 2 + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is less than `(n // 2 + 1) // 2`. If `s[right]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is equal to the previous value of `tleftZero` plus 1, `trightZero` is equal to the previous value of `trightZero` minus 1; otherwise, `tleftOne` is increased by 1, `trightOne` is decreased by 1.**
