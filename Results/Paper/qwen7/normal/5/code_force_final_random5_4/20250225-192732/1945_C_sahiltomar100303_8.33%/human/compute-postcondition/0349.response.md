Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head involves the variable `i`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `mid` to `n-1` (inclusive), as indicated by `for i in range(mid, n)`.

3. **Determine the State After the Previous Iteration:**
   - `s` is a string.
   - `i` is an index within `s`.
   - If the character at index `i` in `s` is '0', then `rightZero` is 2.
   - If the character at index `i` in `s` is not '0', then `rightOne` is increased by 1.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`:**
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

5. **Check the Loop Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

6. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `rightZero` and `rightOne` remain unchanged unless the condition in the loop body is met.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- The current value of `i` is such that it satisfies the loop condition `i < n`.
- The next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `rightZero` and `rightOne` remain unchanged unless the condition in the loop body is met.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`s` is a string, `i` is `i + 1`, and `rightZero` and `rightOne` remain unchanged.**
