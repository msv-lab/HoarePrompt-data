Output State: **`i` is 0, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 1, the current value of `s[i]` is '0'**

Explanation: The code `leftZero += 1` increments the value of `leftZero` by 1. Initially, `leftZero` was not specified, but since no other value is given, we assume it was 0 before this line of code. After executing the code, `leftZero` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
