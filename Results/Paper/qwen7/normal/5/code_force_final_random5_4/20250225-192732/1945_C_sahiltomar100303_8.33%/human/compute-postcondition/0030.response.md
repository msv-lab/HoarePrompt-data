Output State: **`i` is 2; `mid` must still be greater than 1; `leftZero` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `leftZero` is incremented by 1. The values of `i` and `mid` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still 2, `mid` must still be greater than 1, and `leftZero` is increased by 1.
