Output State: **`leftMove` is 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `s` is the input string, `leftZero` is the count of '0's from index 0 to `mid - 1` (either decreased by 1 or unchanged), `leftOne` is the count of '1's from index 0 to `mid - 1` (decreased by 1 if `s[left - 1]` is '1' or unchanged if `s[left - 1]` is '0'), `rightZero` is the count of '0's from index `mid` to the end of the string (increased by 1 if `s[left - 1]` is '0' or unchanged if `s[left - 1]` is '1'), `rightOne` is the count of '1's from index `mid` to the end of the string (unchanged if `s[left - 1]` is '0' or increased by 1 if `s[left - 1]` is '1'), `left` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`, and the character at `left - 1` in `s` is either '0' or '1'.**

Explanation: The variable `left` is decremented by 1, so `left` is now `mid - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
