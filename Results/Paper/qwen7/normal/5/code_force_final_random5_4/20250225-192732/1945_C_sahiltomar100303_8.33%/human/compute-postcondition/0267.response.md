Output State: `left` is 0 or 1, `leftZero` is either 0 or 1, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros in the string from index `left` to `n-1` minus the number of iterations the loop executed, `rightOne` is the total number of ones in the string from index `left` to `n-1` minus the number of iterations the loop executed, `right` is `mid` plus the number of iterations the loop executed, and the values of `trightZero` and `trightOne` are adjusted according to the characters encountered during each iteration of the loop.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `left` will still be either 0 or 1, as it does not change within the loop. The `leftZero` and `leftOne` counts will be either 0 or 1 because they start at 0 or 1 and only increment or decrement by 1 per iteration. `rightZero` and `rightOne` will be reduced by the number of iterations since each iteration decrements these counts by 1 for a zero and 1 for a one, respectively. The `right` index will be `mid` plus the total number of iterations, as it increments by 1 with each iteration. The `trightZero` and `trightOne` values will reflect the cumulative changes made during the loop based on the characters encountered ('0' for `trightZero` and '1' for `trightOne`).
