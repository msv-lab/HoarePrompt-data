Output State: **`leftZero` is now `leftZero - 1`, `i` is equal to `n`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `s` is the input string, `leftOne` is the count of '1's from index 0 to `mid - 1`, `rightZero` is the count of '0's from index `mid` to the end of the string, `rightOne` is the count of '1's from index `mid` to the end of the string and must be less than half of `n - mid + 1`, `left` is assigned the value of `mid`, and the current value of `left` is `mid`. Additionally, the character at `left - 1` in `s` is '0'.**

This means that the value of `leftZero` has been decreased by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
