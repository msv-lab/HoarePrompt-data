Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `mid`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is the loop variable, and it starts from 0.
   - `mid` is defined as `n // 2`, where `n` is an input integer.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < mid`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0, it is already in the correct initial state.
   - `mid` is dependent on `n`, and for the loop to execute, `mid` must be at least 1 (since `i` starts from 0 and goes up to `mid-1`).

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `n` to ensure `mid` is greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
