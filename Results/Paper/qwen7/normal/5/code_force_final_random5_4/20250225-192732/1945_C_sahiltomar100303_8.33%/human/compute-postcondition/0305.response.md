Output State: **`s` is the input string, `left` is 0 or 1, `leftZero` is either 0 or 1, `leftOne` is either 0 or 1, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros in the string from index `left` to `n-1` minus the number of iterations the loop executed, `rightOne` is the total number of ones in the string from index `left` to `n-1` minus the number of iterations the loop executed, `right` is `mid` plus the number of iterations the loop executed, and the values of `trightZero` and `trightOne` are adjusted according to the characters encountered during each iteration of the loop. If `right` equals `n`, then either `trightZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` (in which case `trightZero` remains unchanged) or `rightOne` is less than half of `n + 1`. Otherwise, the absolute difference between `left` and `(n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `right` and `(n + 1) // 2` if `right` is not equal to `n`, and `right` is greater than `n` otherwise. `t` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `s = input()` reads an input string and assigns it to the variable `s`. This changes the value of `s` to the input string provided by the user. All other variables remain in their initial states as described in the precondition.
