Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` is increased by 4 if `s[mid]` is '0', and `leftZero` is increased by 6 if `s[mid]` is not '0'. `leftOne` is increased by 3 if `s[mid]` is not '0', and `leftOne` is increased by 2 if `s[mid]` is '0'. `i` is `mid`, and `tleftZero` is 1 if `s[mid]` is '0', otherwise `tleftOne` is increased by 1.
