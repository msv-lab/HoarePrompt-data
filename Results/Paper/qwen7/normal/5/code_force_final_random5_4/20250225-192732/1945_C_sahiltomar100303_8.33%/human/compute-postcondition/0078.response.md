Output State: **`leftZero` is less than half of `left + 1`, `leftOne` is decreased by 1, `rightOne` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The code `rightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. The other variables (`leftZero`, `leftOne`) remain unchanged from their initial conditions. Therefore, the updated state includes the increment of `rightOne`.
