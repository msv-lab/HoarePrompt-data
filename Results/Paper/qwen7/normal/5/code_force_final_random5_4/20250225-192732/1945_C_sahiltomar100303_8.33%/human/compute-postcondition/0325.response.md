Output State: **`i` is 1, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 1**

The code `leftZero += 1` increments the value of `leftZero` by 1. Given that `leftZero` was initially 0 (implied by the initial state where no specific value for `leftZero` is mentioned, it defaults to 0), after executing the code, `leftZero` becomes 1. The values of `i` and `mid` remain unchanged.
