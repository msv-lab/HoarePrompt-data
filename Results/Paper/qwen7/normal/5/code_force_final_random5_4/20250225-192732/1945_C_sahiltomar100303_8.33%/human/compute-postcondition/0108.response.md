Output State: **`leftMove` is 6, `i` is equal to `n`, `mid` remains as `n // 2`, `s` is the input string, `leftZero` is the count of '0's from index 0 to `mid - 1` (decreased multiple times or unchanged), `leftOne` is the count of '1's from index 0 to `mid - 1` (decreased multiple times or unchanged), `rightZero` is the count of '0's or '1's from index `mid` to the end of the string (increased multiple times or unchanged), `rightOne` is the count of '0's or '1's from index `mid` to the end of the string (increased multiple times or unchanged), `left` is `mid - 3`, `right` is `mid - 2`, `tleftZero` is less than `(n // 2 + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is less than `(n // 2 + 1) // 2`, `trightZero` is decreased by 1 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise `tleftOne` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `right += 1` increments the value of `right` by 1. Initially, `right` was set to satisfy the condition `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2`. After incrementing `right` by 1, `right` becomes `mid - 2`. The values of `leftMove`, `i`, `mid`, `s`, `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `left`, `tleftZero`, `trightOne`, and `trightZero` remain unchanged, except that `trightZero` is decreased by 1 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise `tleftOne` is increased by 1.
