Output State: **`rightOne` is increased by 1, `i` is `mid + 1`, `i` is less than `n`, `n` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `rightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial conditions, which are `i` is `mid + 1` and `n` must be greater than 0. Therefore, `i` is still less than `n`.
