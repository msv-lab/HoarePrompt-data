Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `left` is `mid`, `right` is `n`, `t` is decreased by the total number of iterations, `rightZero` is twice the number of '0's encountered from index `n // 2` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is twice the number of '1's encountered from index `n // 2` to `n-1`, `left` is `n // 2` plus the total number of iterations, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` and `tleftZero` are unchanged, `leftOne` and `tleftOne` are unchanged, `trightZero` and `trightOne` are unchanged.
Code of the loop:
while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) //
    2):
    if s[left - 1] == '0':
        leftZero -= 1
        rightZero += 1
    else:
        leftOne -= 1
        rightOne += 1
    left -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `left` is `n // 2` plus the total number of iterations minus 2 and must be greater than 0, `rightZero` is increased by 1 if `s[left - 1]` was '0', otherwise `rightOne` is increased by 1 and `s[left - 1]` is not '0'.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `leftZero` is updated according to the value of `s[left - 2]`, `rightZero` is updated according to the value of `s[left - 2]`, `left` is decreased by 1, either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` must still hold true.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `left` is `left - 1`, and either `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` must still hold true.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
