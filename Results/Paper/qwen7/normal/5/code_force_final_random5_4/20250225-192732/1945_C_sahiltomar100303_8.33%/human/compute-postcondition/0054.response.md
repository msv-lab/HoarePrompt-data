Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head contains the following variables: `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `mid`.
   - `mid` is `n // 2`.
   - `s` is the input string.
   - `leftZero` is the count of '0's from index 0 to `mid - 1`.
   - `leftOne` is the count of '1's from index 0 to `mid - 1`.
   - If `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `rightOne` is incremented by 1.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   The loop runs as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `mid`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `mid + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Update the Relevant States:**
   - `i` will be updated to `mid + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `leftZero` and `leftOne` remain unchanged because they are based on the substring from 0 to `mid - 1`, which does not change.
   - `rightZero` and `rightOne` may have changed depending on the value of `s[mid]`, but these values are not part of the loop head and thus not adjusted here.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is `mid + 1`, `n` is the same as before**
