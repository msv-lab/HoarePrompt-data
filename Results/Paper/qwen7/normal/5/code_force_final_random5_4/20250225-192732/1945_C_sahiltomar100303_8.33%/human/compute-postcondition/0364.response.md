Output State: **`left` is `mid`, `right` is `n`, `t` is decreased by the total number of iterations, `rightZero` is twice the number of '0's encountered from index `n // 2` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is twice the number of '1's encountered from index `n // 2` to `n-1`, `left` is `n // 2` plus the total number of iterations, `leftZero` and `tleftZero` are unchanged, `leftOne` and `tleftOne` are unchanged, `trightZero` and `trightOne` are unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `left = mid` simply assigns the value of `mid` to `left`. No other variables are affected by this operation. The precondition remains valid except for the change in the value of `left`.
