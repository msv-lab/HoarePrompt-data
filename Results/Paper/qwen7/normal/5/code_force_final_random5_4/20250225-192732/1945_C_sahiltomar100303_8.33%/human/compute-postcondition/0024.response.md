Output State: **`i` is 1; `mid` must be greater than 1; `leftZero` is 2**

The code `tleftZero += 1` increments the value of `leftZero` by 1. Given that `leftZero` was initially 1, after executing this line, `leftZero` becomes 2. The values of `i` and `mid` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
