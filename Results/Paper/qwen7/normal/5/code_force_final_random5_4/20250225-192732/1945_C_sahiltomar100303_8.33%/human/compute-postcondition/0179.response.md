Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` is increased by 4, `leftOne` is increased by 2 if `s[mid]` is not '0', `i` is `mid`, `tleftZero` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `tleftZero += 1` increments the value of `tleftZero` by 1. Initially, `tleftZero` was not specified, but after executing this line, its value is 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.
