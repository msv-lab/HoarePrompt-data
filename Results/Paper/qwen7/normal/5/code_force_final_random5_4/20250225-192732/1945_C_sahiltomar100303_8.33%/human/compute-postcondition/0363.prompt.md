Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is `n // 2`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `left` is `n // 2` plus the total number of iterations, `leftZero` is twice the number of '0's encountered up to index `n // 2 - 1`, `leftOne` is twice the number of '1's encountered up to index `n // 2 - 1`, `rightZero` is 0, `right` is `n`, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is twice the number of '0's encountered up to index `n // 2 - 1`, `tleftOne` is twice the number of '1's encountered up to index `n // 2 - 1`, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `t` is decreased by the number of iterations, and if `right` equals `n`, then either `trightZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` (in which case `trightZero` remains unchanged) or `rightOne` is less than half of `n + 1`, otherwise the absolute difference between `left` and `(n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `right` and `(n + 1) // 2` if `right` is not equal to `n`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n // 2`, meaning the loop has iterated over the first half of the string. The value of `left` will be the midpoint plus the total number of iterations, `leftZero` and `leftOne` will reflect the counts of zeros and ones encountered in the first half of the string respectively, and `right` will be set to `n` indicating the end of the string. The conditions for `trightZero`, `trightOne`, and the comparison involving `left` and `right` will depend on the final values of these variables and the length of the string `n`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(mid, n):
    if s[i] == '0':
        rightZero += 1
        trightZero += 1
    else:
        rightOne += 1
        trightOne += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `s` is a string, and `i` is an index within `s`. If the character at index `i` in `s` is '0', then `rightZero` is 2. If the character at index `i` in `s` is not '0', then `rightOne` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `s` is a string, `i` is `i + 1`, `rightZero` and `rightOne` are updated such that if `s[i]` is '0', `rightZero` is increased by 1, and if `s[i]` is '1', `rightOne` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `s` is a string, `i` is `i + 2`. If `s[i]` is '0', then `rightZero` is increased by 1 and `rightOne` remains unchanged. If `s[i]` is '1', then `rightZero` remains unchanged and `rightOne` is increased by 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
