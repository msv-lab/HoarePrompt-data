Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions at the start of the loop**:
   - `i` is set to `mid`.
   - `i` must be less than `n`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **State at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is `mid`.
   - `i` must be less than `n`.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `mid + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `n`.

6. **Postconditions inside the loop**:
   - If `s[i]` is '0', `rightZero` is incremented by 1.
   - If `s[i]` is not '0', `rightOne` is incremented by 1.

Since these postconditions do not affect the loop condition directly, they do not need to be adjusted in the state for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is `mid + 1`.
- `i` must be less than `n`.

Putting this into the required format:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `mid + 1`, `i` must be less than `n`**
