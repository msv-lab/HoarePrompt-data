Output State: **`left` is 0 or 1, `leftZero` is either 0 or 1, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros in the string from index `left` to `n-1` minus 1, `rightOne` is the total number of ones in the string from index `left` to `n-1`, `right` is `mid` plus 2, `trightOne` is equal to `trightOne - 1`, `tleftZero` must be less than half of the segment length `(right + 1) // 2`, `tleftOne` is `tleftOne` plus 1.**

Explanation: The code `trightOne -= 1` decreases the value of `trightOne` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the given code snippet.
