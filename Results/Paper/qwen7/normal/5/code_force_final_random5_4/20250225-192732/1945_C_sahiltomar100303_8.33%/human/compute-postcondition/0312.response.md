Output State: **`mid` is `n // 2`, `s` is the input string, `left` is 0 or 1, `leftZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `right` is `mid` plus the number of iterations the loop executed, `trightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is 0, if `right` equals `n`, then either `trightZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` (in which case `trightZero` remains unchanged) or `rightOne` is less than half of `n + 1`, otherwise the absolute difference between `left` and `(n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `right` and `(n + 1) // 2` if `right` is not equal to `n`, and `t` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The line `trightZero = 0` sets `trightZero` to 0. This does not affect any other variables or the conditions involving `right`, `left`, and `t`. Therefore, the values of `mid`, `s`, `left`, `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `rightZero`, `right`, `rightOne`, `tleftZero`, and the conditional statements remain unchanged from their initial states.
