Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is less than or equal to 1, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros in the string from index `left` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is the total number of ones in the string from index `left` to `n-1`, `right` is `mid`**.

Explanation: The code `right = mid` assigns the value of `mid` to the variable `right`. This does not affect the values of `left`, `leftZero`, or `rightZero`, nor does it change `rightOne`. The conditions and values of `leftZero` and `rightZero` remain as they were before the assignment. The variable `right` now holds the value of `mid`.
