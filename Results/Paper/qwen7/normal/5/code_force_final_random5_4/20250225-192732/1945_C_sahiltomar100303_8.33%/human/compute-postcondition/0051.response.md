Output State: **`i` is `mid`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `s` is the input string, `leftZero` is the count of '0's from index 0 to `mid - 1`, `leftOne` is the count of '1's from index 0 to `mid - 1`, `rightOne` is `rightOne + 1`**

Explanation: The code `trightOne += 1` increments the value of `trightOne` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated state includes `trightOne` being increased by 1.
