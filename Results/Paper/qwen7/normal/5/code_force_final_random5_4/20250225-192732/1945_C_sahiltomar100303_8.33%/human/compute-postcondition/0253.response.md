Output State: **`left` is 1, `leftZero` is either 0 or 1, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros in the string from index `left` to `n-1` minus 1, `rightOne` is the total number of ones in the string from index `left` to `n-1`, `right` is `mid` plus 1, `trightZero` is equal to `trightZero - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `trightZero -= 1` decreases the value of `trightZero` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `trightZero` is updated to its original value minus 1, while the rest of the variables retain their initial conditions.
