Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `mid`, `i` must be less than `n`, and the current value of `s[i]` is '0', `rightZero` is `rightZero` + 1.**

Explanation: The variable `rightZero` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`n`, `i`, and `s[i]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
