Output State: **`mid` is `n // 2`, `s` is the input string, `left` is 0 or 1, `leftZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is the total number of ones in the string from index `left` to `n-1` minus the number of iterations the loop executed, `right` is `mid` plus the number of iterations the loop executed, `trightZero` and `trightOne` are adjusted according to the characters encountered during each iteration of the loop, if `right` equals `n`, then either `trightZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` (in which case `trightZero` remains unchanged) or `rightOne` is less than half of `n + 1`, otherwise the absolute difference between `left` and `(n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `right` and `(n + 1) // 2` if `right` is not equal to `n`, and `right` is greater than `n` otherwise, `t` is decreased by 1.**

The variable `leftOne` is updated to 0, while all other variables retain their previous values. The conditions involving `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, and the comparison involving `left` and `right` remain unchanged.
