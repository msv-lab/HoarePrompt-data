Postcondition: **`s` is a list of characters with at least one character, `i` is the next character in the list `s`, and `thorn` is incremented by 1 if `i` equals '*', and remains 0 if `i` does not equal '*', `ret` is 1.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block executes. It states that `s` remains a list of characters with at least one character, `i` is the next character in the list `s`, `thorn` is incremented by 1 if `i` equals '*', and remains 0 if `i` does not equal '*', and `ret` is 1.
