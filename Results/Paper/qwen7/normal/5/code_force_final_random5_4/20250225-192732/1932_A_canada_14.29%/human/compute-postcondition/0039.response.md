Output State: **`thorn` is either 1, 2, or 3; `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is an input integer determined by the length of the input; `s` is a list of characters with at least one character remaining, `ret` is 0; `i` is the second character in the list `s`.**

Explanation: The value of `thorn` is incremented by 1. Since `thorn` could initially be 0, 1, or 2, after incrementing by 1, `thorn` can now be 1, 2, or 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
