Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `thorn` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is the input integer minus 1, `s` is now a list of characters from the new input string, `ret` is 0, `i` is the last character in the list `s`, `len` is the integer input
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == '@':
        thorn = 0
        ret += 1
    elif i == '*':
        thorn += 1
        if thorn == 2:
            break
    else:
        thorn == 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `s` is a list of characters with at least one character, `thorn` is 2 if `i` equals '*', and `thorn` is 0 if `i` does not equal '*'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is a list of characters with at least one character, `i` is the next character in the list `s`, and `thorn` is incremented by 1 if `i` equals '*', and remains 0 if `i` does not equal '*', `ret` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `s` is a list of characters with at least one character, `i` is the next character in the list `s`, `thorn` is incremented by 1 if `i` equals '*', remaining 0 otherwise, and `ret` is 1. If `thorn` equals 2, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
