Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer determined by the length of the input.**

Explanation: The code `len = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged as it is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000. The variable `n` now holds the value of the input provided by the user, which is converted to an integer.
