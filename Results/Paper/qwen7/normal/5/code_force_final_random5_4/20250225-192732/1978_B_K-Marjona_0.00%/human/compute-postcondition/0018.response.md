Output State: **`n` is an integer from the input, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, and `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `min(n, b - a)` to `k`. This means `k` now holds the smaller value between `n` and `b - a`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
