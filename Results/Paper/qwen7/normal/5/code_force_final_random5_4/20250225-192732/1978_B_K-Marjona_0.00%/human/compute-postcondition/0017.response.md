Output State: **`n` is an integer from the input, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, and `k` is the same value as before.**

Explanation: The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes three integers as input separated by spaces and assigns them to `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively. The value of `k` remains unchanged from its initial state.
