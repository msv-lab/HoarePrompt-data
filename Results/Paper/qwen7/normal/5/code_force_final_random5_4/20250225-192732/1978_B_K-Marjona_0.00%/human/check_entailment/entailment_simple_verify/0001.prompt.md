You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three positive integers n, a, and b, where n is the number of buns, a is the usual price of a bun, and b is the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price (0 ≤ k ≤ min(n, b)).
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        k = min(n, b - a)
        
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed for all the test cases provided by the user. For each test case, the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` represent the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, respectively. The variable `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`. If `b` is greater than `a`, `k` is also the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`. The final output for each test case is calculated based on whether `b` is less than or equal to `a` or not, as described in the loop body.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize Bob's profit by choosing an optimal \( k \).
   - If \( b \leq a \), selling all buns at the usual price \( a \) is the best option.
   - Otherwise, we need to find the optimal \( k \) such that the sum of the modified prices for the first \( k \) buns plus the usual price for the remaining \( n - k \) buns is maximized.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The function iterates over the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).
   - It calculates \( k \) as \( \min(n, b - a) \). This ensures \( k \) is within the valid range and reflects the difference between the usual price and the modified price.
   - If \( b \leq a \), it prints \( a \times n \) because selling all buns at the usual price is optimal.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the profit using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = \left( \frac{(b + (b - k + 1))}{2} \right) \times k + (n - k) \times a
     \]
     This formula is derived from the sum of an arithmetic series for the first \( k \) buns and the usual price for the remaining \( n - k \) buns.

3. **Verification:**
   - The logic for calculating \( k \) is correct.
   - The condition \( b \leq a \) correctly handles the scenario where selling all buns at the usual price is optimal.
   - The profit calculation formula is correct and aligns with the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The given solution correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns under the given conditions.

### Correctness:
**True**
