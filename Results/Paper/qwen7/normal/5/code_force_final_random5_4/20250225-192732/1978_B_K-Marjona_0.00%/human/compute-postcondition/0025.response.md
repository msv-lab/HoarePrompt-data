Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three positive integers: the number of buns (n), the usual price of a bun (a), and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price (b). It calculates and prints the total cost based on these inputs. If the price of the first modified bun (b) is less than or equal to the usual price (a), it calculates the total cost as the usual price multiplied by the number of buns. Otherwise, it calculates the total cost considering both the usual and modified prices for the buns.**
