Output State: **`i` is 3, `last_year` is 4, `results` is ['4'], `index` is increased by 1 plus `n`, `a` is [3]**.

Explanation: The variable `index` is incremented by `n`. Since `n` is not defined in the initial state, we keep it as `n` in the output state. The other variables (`i`, `last_year`, `results`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
