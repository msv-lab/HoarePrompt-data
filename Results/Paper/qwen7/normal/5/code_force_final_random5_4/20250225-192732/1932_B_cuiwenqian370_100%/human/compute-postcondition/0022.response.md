Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 1, `last_year` equals `(last_year + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`. The variable `last_year` will be updated in each iteration according to the formula `next_year = (last_year + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`, and by the end of the loop, it will hold the final value after processing all elements in the list `a`.
