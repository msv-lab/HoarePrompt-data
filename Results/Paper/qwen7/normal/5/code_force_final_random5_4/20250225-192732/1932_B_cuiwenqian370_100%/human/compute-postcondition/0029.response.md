Output State: **`index` is incremented by n, `n` is assigned the value of `data[index-1]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting elements from `data` starting from `index-1` and continuing for `n` elements, `last_year` is the first element of list `a`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `a[0]` to `last_year`, which means `last_year` now holds the first element of the list `a`. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
