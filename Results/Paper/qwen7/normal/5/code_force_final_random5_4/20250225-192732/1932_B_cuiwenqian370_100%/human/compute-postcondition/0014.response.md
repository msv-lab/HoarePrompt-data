Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1, `next_year` is (last_year + 0) // a[1] * a[1], `last_year` equals `next_year`**.

Explanation: The code updates `last_year` to be equal to `next_year`. Since `next_year` is defined as `(last_year + 0) // a[1] * a[1]`, after the assignment, `last_year` now holds the same value as `next_year`. The other variables (`i` and `n`) remain unchanged.
