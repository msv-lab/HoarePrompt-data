Output State: **`i` must be less than 4, `n` must be greater than 3, `last_year` is equal to `next_year`, `next_year` is equal to ((`last_year` + 1 + `a[i]` - 1) // `a[i`] * `a[i]`).**

Explanation: The code `last_year = next_year` simply assigns the value of `next_year` to `last_year`. This does not change the conditions or the expressions involving other variables. Therefore, the conditions and expressions for `i`, `n`, `last_year`, and `next_year` remain the same as they were initially.
