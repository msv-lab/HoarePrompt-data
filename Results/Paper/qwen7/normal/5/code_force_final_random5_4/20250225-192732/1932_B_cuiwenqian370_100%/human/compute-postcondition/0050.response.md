Output State: **`i` must be 1 or greater, `n` must be greater than 3, `last_year` is equal to `next_year`.**

Explanation: The code `last_year = next_year` updates the value of `last_year` to be the same as `next_year`. The initial state of `next_year` is given by the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`. Since `last_year` is now equal to `next_year`, the value of `last_year` is updated to match this expression, but the specific numerical value depends on the values of `last_year`, `a[i]`, and `i`. However, the key point is that `last_year` is now directly equal to `next_year`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
