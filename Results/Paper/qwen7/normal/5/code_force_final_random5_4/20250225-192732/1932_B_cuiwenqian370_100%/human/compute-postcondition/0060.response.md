Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `last_year` is the final value after processing all elements in the list `a` for all iterations, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `last_year` for each iteration.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has processed all elements in the list `a`. The variable `last_year` will hold the final computed value after processing all elements in the list `a` for the last iteration. The `results` list will contain the string representation of `last_year` for each iteration that was executed, which in this case would be the final `last_year` value for each iteration.
