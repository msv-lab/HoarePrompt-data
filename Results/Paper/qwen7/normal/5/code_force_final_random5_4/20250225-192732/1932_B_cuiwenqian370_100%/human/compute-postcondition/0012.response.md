Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - `i` should start from 1 and go up to `n-1` (since the range function in Python generates numbers from the start value up to but not including the stop value).
   - `n` should be a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute.

3. **Check the given state before the loop**:
   - `index` is `3 + n`.
   - `T` is an integer from the list `data` at position 3.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `n` is an integer obtained from `data[3]`.
   - `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^6\).
   - `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using spaces.
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting the slice of `data` from index 3 to 3+n to integers.
   - `last_year` is the first element of the list `a`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`, `i` must be set to 1 initially.
   - `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the final state after adjustment is:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1**
