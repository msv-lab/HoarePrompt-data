Output State: **`i` is 3, `last_year` is 4, `results` is ['4']**

Explanation: The loop runs for the first three iterations since `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each time, reaching 3 within these iterations. After the third iteration, `i` will no longer satisfy the condition `i < n`, thus ending the loop. During each iteration, `last_year` is updated to 4, and `i` is incremented. After the loop, `results` is appended with the string representation of `last_year`, which is '4'.
