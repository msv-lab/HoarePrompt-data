Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly decode the encoded string. Specifically, the issue lies in the way the `char_map` is constructed. The program assumes that the characters in the auxiliary string `r` are in alphabetical order and maps each character to its symmetric counterpart in `r`. However, the problem description states that the auxiliary string `r` is constructed by taking all distinct letters of the original string `s` in alphabetical order, not the order they appear in the encoded string `b`.

For example, consider the encoded string `b = "serofedsoc"` which is the result of encoding `"codeforces"`. According to the problem description, the auxiliary string `r` should be `"cdefors"`, not the order of unique characters in the encoded string `b`.

The program incorrectly sorts the unique characters of the encoded string `b` alphabetically and then maps them to their symmetric counterparts. This leads to incorrect decoding for strings where the order of unique characters in the original string `s` matters.

To fix this, the program should first construct the auxiliary string `r` by taking the unique characters of the original string `s` in alphabetical order, and then map the characters in the encoded string `b` accordingly.
