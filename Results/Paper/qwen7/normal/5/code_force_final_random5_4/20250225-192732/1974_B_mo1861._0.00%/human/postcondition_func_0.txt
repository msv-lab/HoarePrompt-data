The function accepts a string `b` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and decodes it to form the original string `s`. It achieves this by creating a mapping where each unique character in `b` is replaced with a corresponding character starting from 'z' and moving backwards based on the character's position in the sorted list of unique characters. Finally, it returns the decoded string `s` formed by applying this mapping to each character in `b`.
