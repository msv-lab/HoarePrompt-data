You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a string `b` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and decodes it to form the original string `s`. It achieves this by creating a mapping where each unique character in `b` is replaced with a corresponding character starting from 'z' and moving backwards based on the character's position in the sorted list of unique characters. Finally, it returns the decoded string `s` formed by applying this mapping to each character in `b`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly decode the encoded string. Specifically, the issue lies in the way the `char_map` is constructed. The program assumes that the characters in the auxiliary string `r` are in alphabetical order and maps each character to its symmetric counterpart in `r`. However, the problem description states that the auxiliary string `r` is constructed by taking all distinct letters of the original string `s` in alphabetical order, not the order they appear in the encoded string `b`.

For example, consider the encoded string `b = "serofedsoc"` which is the result of encoding `"codeforces"`. According to the problem description, the auxiliary string `r` should be `"cdefors"`, not the order of unique characters in the encoded string `b`.

The program incorrectly sorts the unique characters of the encoded string `b` alphabetically and then maps them to their symmetric counterparts. This leads to incorrect decoding for strings where the order of unique characters in the original string `s` matters.

To fix this, the program should first construct the auxiliary string `r` by taking the unique characters of the original string `s` in alphabetical order, and then map the characters in the encoded string `b` accordingly.
