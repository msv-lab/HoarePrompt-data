Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for c in b:`. This means the loop iterates over each element `c` in the list `b`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `s` is updated by adding `char_map[c]` to its current value.
   - `b` still contains at least one element.

3. **Understand what happens in the loop**:
   - In each iteration, `c` takes the value of an element from `b`.
   - `s` is updated by adding `char_map[c]` to its current value.
   - After processing one element from `b`, `b` will have one less element (assuming `b` is being consumed in the loop).

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `b` still contains at least one element, it means there is at least one more element left to process.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must contain at least two elements (one for the current iteration and one for the next iteration).
   - `s` will be updated again by adding `char_map[c]` to its current value, where `c` is the next element from `b`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `s` will be updated by adding `char_map[c]` to its current value, where `c` is the next element from `b`.
   - `b` must contain at least two elements for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `s` is updated by adding `char_map[c]` to its current value, `b` must contain at least two elements**.
