Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `c`.
2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each unique character in the sorted form of `b`. The variable `i` is the index, and `c` is the character at that index.
3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `b` must contain at least one unique character.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `c` is the first unique character in the sorted form of `b`.
   - `char_map[c]` is assigned the value `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration, after the first iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - The character `c` will now be the second unique character in the sorted form of `b`.
   - The length of `b` remains the same, so `len(b)` does not change.

Given this information, let's update the states accordingly:

- `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
- `c` will be the second unique character in the sorted form of `b`.
- `char_map[c]` will be updated based on the new value of `i`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `b` must contain at least one unique character, `i` is 1, `c` is the second unique character in the sorted form of `b`, `char_map[c]` is assigned the value `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`**
