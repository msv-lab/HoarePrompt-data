You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: b is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of b is at most 2 * 10^5. It is guaranteed that b is the result of encoding some string s according to the described algorithm.
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    char_map = {}
    for (i, c) in enumerate(sorted(set(b))):
        char_map[c] = chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))
        
    #State: The output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows: `b` contains a list of unique characters sorted in ascending order, `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character from `b` is mapped to a unique lowercase letter starting from 'z' and going backwards based on the position of the character in the sorted unique character list. Specifically, the last unique character in the sorted list will be mapped to 'a', the second last to 'b', and so on, until the first unique character which will be mapped to 'z'.
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
        
    #State: `s` is a concatenated string formed by adding `char_map[c]` for each element `c` in `b`.
    return s
    #The program returns a string `s` that is formed by concatenating `char_map[c]` for each element `c` in `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `b`, which is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a maximum length of 2 * 10^5. The function returns a string `s` formed by concatenating `char_map[c]` for each element `c` in `b`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a string `s` that is formed by concatenating `char_map[c]` for each element `c` in `b`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
