Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the following objects:
   - `i`: An integer representing the index.
   - `c`: A character from the sorted set of unique characters in the string `b`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length is at most \(2 \times 10^5\).
   - `char_map` is an empty dictionary, but this is not relevant to the loop head.

3. **Understand the loop condition**:
   - The loop iterates over each unique character in the string `b`, sorted alphabetically.
   - The variable `i` represents the index of the current character `c` in the sorted set of unique characters.

4. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute, there must be at least one unique character in the string `b`.
   - The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment with each iteration.
   - The variable `c` will be the first unique character in the sorted set of `b`.

Given the above points, the necessary adjustments are:
- `b` must contain at least one unique character.
- `i` should start from 0.
- `c` should be the first unique character in the sorted set of `b`.

Therefore, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: `b` is a string containing at least one unique character, `i` is 0, `c` is the first unique character in the sorted set of `b`**
