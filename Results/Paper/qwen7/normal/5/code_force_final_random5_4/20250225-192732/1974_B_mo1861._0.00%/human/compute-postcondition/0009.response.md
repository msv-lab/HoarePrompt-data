Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `c`. The loop iterates over each character in the sorted set of `b`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `b` must contain at least one unique character.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `c` is the second unique character in the sorted form of `b`.
   - `char_map[c]` is assigned the value `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`.

3. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the loop has processed the first character in the sorted set of `b`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - The next character `c` in the sorted set of `b` will be the third unique character (since the first two were already processed).
   - The value of `char_map[c]` will be updated based on the new `i` value.

4. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `c` will be the third unique character in the sorted form of `b`.
   - `char_map[c]` will be assigned the value `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`, which simplifies to `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - 2 - 1)) = chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - 3))`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`b` must contain at least one unique character, `i` is 2, `c` is the third unique character in the sorted form of `b`, `char_map[c]` is assigned the value `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - 3))**.
