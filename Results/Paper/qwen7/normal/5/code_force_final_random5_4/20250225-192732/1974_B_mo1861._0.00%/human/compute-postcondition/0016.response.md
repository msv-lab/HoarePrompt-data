Output State: **`s` is updated by adding `char_map[c]` to its current value, `b` still contains at least one element.**

Explanation: The code `s += char_map[c]` updates the value of `s` by adding the value of `char_map[c]` to its current value. The precondition that `b` must still contain at least one element remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `s` and the fact that `b` still contains at least one element.
