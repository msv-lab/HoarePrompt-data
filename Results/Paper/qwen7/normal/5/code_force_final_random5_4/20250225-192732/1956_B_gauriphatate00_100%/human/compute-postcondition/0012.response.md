Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of `n-1` integers where each integer is between 1 and `n` inclusive, and each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most twice in the list; `count_a[num]` is 1, and `num` is the first element in the updated list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `count_a[num] = 1` sets the value of `count_a[num]` to 1. Since `num` is the first element in the updated list `a`, and `a` is a non-empty list of `n-1` integers where each integer is between 1 and `n` inclusive, and each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most twice in the list, the only change is that `count_a[num]` is now 1.
