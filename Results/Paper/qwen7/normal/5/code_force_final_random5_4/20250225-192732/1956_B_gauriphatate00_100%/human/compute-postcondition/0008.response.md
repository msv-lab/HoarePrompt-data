Postcondition: `a` is a non-empty list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and `n` inclusive, and each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most twice in the list; `count_a` is a dictionary. If `num` is already a key in `count_a`, its corresponding value is increased by 1. If `num` is not in `count_a`, a new key-value pair `{num: 1}` is added to `count_a`.
