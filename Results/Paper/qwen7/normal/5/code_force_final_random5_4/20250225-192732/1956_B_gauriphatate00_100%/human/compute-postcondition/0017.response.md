Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list of `n-1` integers where each integer is between 1 and `n` inclusive, and the first element in the list `a` is `num`; `count_a[num]` is equal to 1.**

This means that the first element in the list `a` is now `num`, and the count of `num` in `count_a` is set to 1. All other conditions remain the same as the initial state, with each integer from 1 to `n` appearing at most twice in the list `a`.
