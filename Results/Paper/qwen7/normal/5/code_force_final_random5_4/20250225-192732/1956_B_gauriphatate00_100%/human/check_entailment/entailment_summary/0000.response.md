Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally.
2. The given code defines a function `func_1` that attempts to solve this problem by counting the occurrences of each number in the list `a`.
3. However, the logic in `func_1` is flawed. Specifically, it incorrectly calculates the maximum score you can achieve.
4. The function currently increments `max_score` by 1 for each number that appears exactly twice in the list `a`. This is not the correct approach because:
   - Nene will always try to minimize your score while maximizing hers. Therefore, if you have a card that appears exactly twice, Nene will ensure that you do not get any points for that card.
   - The correct strategy is to consider the worst-case scenario for you, where Nene always picks the card that maximizes her score and minimizes yours.

Given the execution summary, the provided solution assumes that the maximum score is 3, which is incorrect based on the problem statement and the optimal play strategy described.

Correctness: **False**
