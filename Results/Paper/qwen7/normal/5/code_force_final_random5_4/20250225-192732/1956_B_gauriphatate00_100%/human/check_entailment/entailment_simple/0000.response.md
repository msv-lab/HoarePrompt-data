Reasoning:
- The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
- For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the list of integers `a` representing the cards in your hand.
- The function `func_1` is called with `a` and `n` as arguments.
- In `func_1`, a dictionary `count_a` is created to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
- The function then iterates through the range from 1 to `n` and checks if each integer exists in `count_a` with a count of 2. If so, it increments `max_score`.
- Finally, the function returns `max_score`.

However, there are a few issues with the logic in `func_1`:
1. The function does not account for the fact that Nene will always play optimally to minimize your score. This means that if you have a card that Nene can use to gain a point, she will do so, and this should affect your strategy.
2. The logic in `func_1` assumes that you can always get the maximum possible score, which is not necessarily true due to Nene's optimal play.

Given the problem statement, the function should consider the optimal play of Nene and adjust your strategy accordingly. The current implementation does not reflect this.

Correctness: **False**

To correctly solve this problem, you would need to simulate the game and consider Nene's optimal moves, which is not done in the current implementation.
