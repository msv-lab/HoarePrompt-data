Postcondition: `a` is a non-empty list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and `n` inclusive, and each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most twice in the list; `count_a` is a dictionary where the value of `count_a[num]` is either increased by 1 if `num` was already a key in `count_a`, or set to 1 if `num` was not a key in `count_a`.
