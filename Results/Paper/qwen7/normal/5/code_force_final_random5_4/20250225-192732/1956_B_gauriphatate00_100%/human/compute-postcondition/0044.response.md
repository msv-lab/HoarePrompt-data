The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a`, which is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and `n` inclusive, and each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most twice in the list; and `n`, which is an integer representing the length of the list `a`. The function returns 3.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of `n` integers (each between 1 and `n` inclusive, with each integer appearing at most twice) and an integer `n`, and returns 3.**
