Postcondition: `max_score` is 0, `a` is an empty list, `count_a` is a dictionary containing the count of each unique integer from the original list `a`, ranging from 1 to 2, reflecting how many times each integer appeared in the list, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and the current value of `num` is in `count_a`. Additionally, the count of `num` in `count_a` is exactly 2.
