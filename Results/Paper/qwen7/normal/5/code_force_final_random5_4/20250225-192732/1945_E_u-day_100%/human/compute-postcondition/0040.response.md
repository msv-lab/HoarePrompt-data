Postcondition: `low`, `high`, and `mid` retain their original values or update according to the if-else condition. If `arr[mid] > k`, then `low` is set to `mid` and `high` is set to `mid`. Otherwise, `low` remains unchanged, and `high` remains as either `(0 + n) // 2` or `n`. The set `st` always contains the value of `mid`.
