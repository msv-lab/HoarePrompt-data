Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Problem Description**: We need to find a way to rearrange the permutation `p` using at most 2 swaps such that the element `x` is at position `l` after performing a binary search. The binary search should end with `p[l] == x`.

2. **Binary Search Algorithm**: The binary search algorithm is designed to find the target value `x` in the array `p`. It starts with `l = 1` and `r = n + 1` and repeatedly halves the search interval until it finds the target.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The program should identify the position of `x` in the permutation.
   - It should ensure that the binary search can correctly identify `x` after at most 2 swaps.

### Program Analysis

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - `func_1()`: Reads a line of input and splits it into integers.
   - `func_2()`: Converts the result of `func_1()` into a list of integers.
   - `func_3()`: Implements the main logic for solving the problem.

2. **Main Logic in `func_3()`**:
   - **Step 1**: Read the input values `n` and `k`.
   - **Step 2**: Read the permutation `arr`.
   - **Step 3**: Find the position `pos` of `k` in the permutation.
   - **Step 4**: Initialize `low` and `high` for the binary search.
   - **Step 5**: Perform the binary search:
     - Calculate the middle index `mid`.
     - Add `mid` to a set `st` to avoid infinite loops.
     - Adjust `low` and `high` based on the comparison between `arr[mid]` and `k`.
   - **Step 6**: Check if `arr[low]` equals `k`:
     - If true, print `0` (no swaps needed).
     - Otherwise, print `1` and the positions to swap.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The binary search logic in the provided code does not correctly handle the case where `arr[low]` is not equal to `k` after the initial binary search.
   - The program assumes that the binary search will always find `k` without considering the possibility of needing additional swaps.

2. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The program attempts to swap elements to place `k` at the correct position, but it does not ensure that the binary search will work correctly after the swaps.
   - The logic for determining the positions to swap is not robust and may not always produce the correct result.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
