Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `low + 1 < high`.

2. **Determine the current state**:
   - `low` is either 0 or `mid`.
   - `high` is either `(0 + n) // 2` or `n`.
   - `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`.
   - `pos` is 3 (this is not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
   - `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()` call.
   - `i` is n (this is not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `st` is a set containing the values `(0 + n) // 2` and `mid`.

3. **Analyze the loop head**:
   - The loop head involves the variables `low` and `high`.

4. **Check the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to continue, `low + 1 < high` must be true.

5. **Current state analysis**:
   - `low` can be either 0 or `mid`.
   - `high` can be either `(0 + n) // 2` or `n`.

6. **Determine necessary adjustments**:
   - To ensure `low + 1 < high` is true, `low` cannot be equal to `high - 1`.
   - Since `low` can be 0 or `mid`, and `high` can be `(0 + n) // 2` or `n`, we need to ensure that `low` and `high` are not consecutive integers.

Given the possible values:
- If `low` is 0, then `high` must be greater than 1 (i.e., `high` must be at least 2).
- If `low` is `mid`, then `high` must be greater than `mid + 1`.

Since `high` can be `(0 + n) // 2` or `n`, and `low` can be 0 or `mid`, we need to ensure that `low` and `high` are not consecutive.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `high` is at least 2 if `low` is 0, or `high` is greater than `mid + 1` if `low` is `mid`.

State: **`low` is either 0 or `mid`, `high` is either `(0 + n) // 2` or `n`, and `high` must be at least 2 if `low` is 0, or `high` must be greater than `mid + 1` if `low` is `mid`.**

Final Answer:
State: **`low` is either 0 or `mid`, `high` is either `(0 + n) // 2` or `n`, and `high` must be at least 2 if `low` is 0, or `high` must be greater than `mid + 1` if `low` is `mid`.**
