Postcondition: **`low` is either 0 or one of the previously calculated `mid` values, `high` is either `n` or one of the previously calculated `mid` values, `mid` is the final calculated midpoint value from the last iteration, `pos` is 3, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()` call, and `i` is n; `st` is a set containing all the unique `mid` values calculated during the loop iterations. Additionally, `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.**
