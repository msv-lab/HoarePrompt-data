Postcondition: **Output State: `low` is the smallest index where `arr[low]` is greater than or equal to `k`, or it is 0 if no such index exists, `high` is the largest index where `arr[high]` is less than `k`, or it is `n` if no such index exists, `mid` is the final calculated midpoint value from the last iteration of the loop, `pos` is 3, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()` call, `i` is n, `st` is a set containing all the unique `mid` values calculated during the loop iterations, and the current value of `arr[low]` is equal to `k`.**
