Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the target value `k` is not present in the permutation `arr`. According to the problem description, the goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation such that after performing the binary search, `p_l` is equal to `x`. However, the program only checks if `arr[low] == k` and prints `0` or `1` accordingly without attempting to rearrange the elements if `k` is not found.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:
- Input:
  ```
  6 3
  4 3 1 5 2 6
  ```

- Expected Output:
  The target value `3` is not present in the permutation, so the program should output `2` operations and the pairs of indices to swap. For example:
  ```
  2
  1 4
  4 5
  ```

- Actual Output:
  The program outputs `1` and `1 4`, which is incorrect because it does not ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x`.

Since the program does not handle the case where the target value is not present in the permutation, it is not correct according to the problem description.
