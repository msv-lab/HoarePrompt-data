Output State: **`low` is either 0 or `mid`, `high` is either `(0 + n) // 2` or `n`, `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`, `pos` is 3, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()` call, and `i` is n; `st` is a set containing the values `(0 + n) // 2` and `mid`.**

Explanation: The code adds the value of `mid` to the set `st`. Since `mid` is already calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, the set `st` now contains both `(0 + n) // 2` and `mid`, which are the same value. Therefore, the set `st` now includes these two identical values. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
