You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation array arr, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and arr is a permutation of integers from 1 to n.
def func_3():
    n, k = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
        
    #State: pos is 3, n is a positive integer, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, arr is the result of the function func_2() call, and i is n.
    low, high = 0, n
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        st.add(mid)
        
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State: Output State: `low` is either 0 or one of the previously calculated `mid` values, `high` is either `n` or one of the previously calculated `mid` values, `mid` is the final calculated midpoint value from the last iteration, `pos` is 3, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()` call, and `i` is n; `st` is a set containing all the unique `mid` values calculated during the loop iterations.
    #
    #Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `low` will be the smallest index where `arr[low]` is greater than or equal to `k`, or it will be 0 if no such index exists. Similarly, `high` will be the largest index where `arr[high]` is less than `k`, or it will be `n` if no such index exists. The variable `mid` will hold the final calculated midpoint value from the last iteration of the loop. The variable `st` will contain all the unique midpoint values calculated during the loop iterations. The values of `pos`, `k`, `arr`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
    if (arr[low] == k) :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    else :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        #This is printed: low + 1, 4
    #State: `low` is the smallest index where `arr[low]` is greater than or equal to `k`, or it is 0 if no such index exists, `high` is the largest index where `arr[high]` is less than `k`, or it is `n` if no such index exists, `mid` is the final calculated midpoint value from the last iteration of the loop, `pos` is 3, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()` call, `i` is n, `st` is a set containing all the unique `mid` values calculated during the loop iterations, and `arr[low]` is equal to `k` if `arr[low]` is equal to `k`, otherwise `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies that it works with a permutation array `arr` of length `n` and an integer `k` where 1 ≤ k ≤ n. It returns a specific element from the array `arr` based on the index `k-1`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
