Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is n, `mid` is (0 + n) // 2, `pos` is 3, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()` call, and `i` is n; `st` is a set containing the value (0 + n) // 2.**

Explanation: The code adds the value of `mid`, which is `(0 + n) // 2`, to the set `st`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
