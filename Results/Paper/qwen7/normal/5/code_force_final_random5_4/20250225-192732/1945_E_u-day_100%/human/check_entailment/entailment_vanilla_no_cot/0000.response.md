Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. Specifically, it attempts to perform a binary search directly on the given permutation without ensuring that the necessary swaps have been made to make the element `x` accessible at the position where the binary search would place it (`p_l`). The program also does not handle the task of performing at most 2 swaps to achieve the desired result.

To solve this problem correctly, the program should:
1. Identify the position of `x` in the permutation.
2. Determine the necessary swaps to bring `x` to the position where the binary search would find it.
3. Perform the swaps and then run the binary search.

The current implementation only performs a binary search and does not handle the required swaps. Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect.
