Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head condition is `low + 1 < high`.

2. **Analyze the current state**:
   - `low` is 0.
   - `high` is `n`.
   - `pos` is 3 (not relevant to the loop head).
   - `n` is a positive integer (this doesn't directly affect the loop head but ensures `high` is valid).
   - `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n (not relevant to the loop head).
   - `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()` call (not relevant to the loop head).
   - `i` is `n` (not relevant to the loop head).
   - `st` is an empty set (not relevant to the loop head).

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `low + 1 < high`.
   - Given `low` is 0 and `high` is `n`, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - The only variable in the loop head that needs adjustment is `high` (which is `n`). Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1.

Given this analysis, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to reflect that `n` must be greater than 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`low` is 0, `high` is n and n must be greater than 1, `pos` is 3, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()` call, and `i` is n; `st` is an empty set.**
