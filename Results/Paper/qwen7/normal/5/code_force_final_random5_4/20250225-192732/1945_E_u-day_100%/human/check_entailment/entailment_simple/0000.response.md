Reasoning:
1. The problem requires rearranging the permutation array so that the element `x` is at position `l` after performing at most 2 swaps.
2. The provided code does not actually perform any swaps. Instead, it prints the number of swaps needed (either 0 or 1) and the positions of the elements to be swapped if necessary.
3. The logic inside `func_3()` checks if `arr[low]` is equal to `k`. If it is, it prints `0`, indicating no swaps are needed. Otherwise, it prints `1` and the positions `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.
4. The variable `pos` is set to the position of `k` in the array, but the code does not use this information to perform any swaps. It only uses it to check if the element at `low` is `k`.
5. The binary search logic is used to find the position of `k` in the array, but it does not ensure that the array is rearranged correctly before performing the binary search.
6. The problem statement requires that the array be rearranged using at most 2 swaps, but the provided code does not implement this requirement.

Given these points, the provided code does not meet the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
