### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the annotated code and the original assessment step-by-step.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function reads two integers from the user input, separated by a space, and returns a map object containing these two integers.
   - This function is used to read the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function calls `func_1()` and returns a list generated by `func_1()`.
   - This function is not used in the main logic of the program and seems redundant.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function takes `n` and `k` as input, reads the permutation `arr` using `func_2()`, and then performs the following steps:
     - Finds the position of `k` in the permutation `arr` and stores it in `pos`.
     - Uses binary search to find the smallest index `low` where `arr[low]` is greater than or equal to `k`.
     - If `arr[low]` equals `k`, it prints `0`.
     - If `arr[low]` does not equal `k`, it prints `1` and `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.

#### Original Assessment:

The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the target value `k` is not present in the permutation `arr`. The program only checks if `arr[low] == k` and prints `0` or `1` accordingly without attempting to rearrange the elements if `k` is not found.

However, upon closer inspection, the original assessment is incorrect for the following reasons:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The binary search implemented in `func_3` correctly finds the smallest index `low` where `arr[low]` is greater than or equal to `k` or 0 if no such index exists.
   - This is a valid approach to ensure that the binary search condition is met.

2. **Output Handling**:
   - If `arr[low] == k`, the program prints `0`, indicating that no swaps are needed.
   - If `arr[low] != k`, the program prints `1` and the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1`, which are the positions to swap to make sure `p_l` is equal to `x`.

3. **Rearrangement**:
   - The program does not explicitly perform the swaps within the function, but it provides the necessary indices for the swaps.
   - The actual swapping would be done outside the function, which is consistent with the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly identifies the necessary swaps and provides the correct output format. The original assessment is inaccurate because it overlooks the fact that the program correctly handles the binary search and provides the required indices for rearrangement.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description.
