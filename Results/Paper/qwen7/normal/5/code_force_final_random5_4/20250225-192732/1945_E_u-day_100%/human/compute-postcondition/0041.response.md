Output State: `low` is either 0 or `mid` from the last iteration, `high` is either `mid` or `n` from the last iteration, `mid` is updated to the final value of `(low + high) // 2`, `pos` is 3, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()` call, and `i` is n; `st` is a set containing all the unique values of `mid` from each iteration of the loop.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `low` and `high` will converge to the same value or `low` will be equal to `high - 1`. The variable `mid` will hold the final midpoint value calculated in the last iteration. The set `st` will contain all the unique midpoint values calculated during the loop's execution. The other variables (`pos`, `k`, `arr`, `i`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
