Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is n, `pos` is 3, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()` call, and `i` is n; `st` is an empty set.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty set named `st`. This does not affect the values of any other variables. Therefore, the values of `low`, `high`, `pos`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, and `i` remain unchanged, and a new variable `st` is introduced as an empty set.
