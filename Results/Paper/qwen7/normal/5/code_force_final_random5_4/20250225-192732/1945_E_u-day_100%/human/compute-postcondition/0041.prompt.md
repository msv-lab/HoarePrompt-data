Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `low` is 0, `high` is n, `pos` is 3, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()` call, and `i` is n; `st` is an empty set.
Code of the loop:
while low + 1 < high:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    st.add(mid)
    if arr[mid] > k:
        high = mid
    else:
        low = mid


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `low` is either 0 or `mid`, `high` is either `(0 + n) // 2` or `n`, `mid` is `(0 + n) // 2`, `pos` is 3, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()` call, and `i` is n; `st` is a set containing the value `(0 + n) // 2`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `low` is either 0 or `mid`, `high` is either `(0 + n) // 2` or `n`, `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`, `pos` is 3, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()` call, and `i` is n; `st` is a set containing the values `(0 + n) // 2` and `mid`. If `arr[mid] > k`, then `high` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`. Otherwise, `low` is set to `mid`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `low`, `high`, and `mid` retain their original values or update according to the if-else condition. If `arr[mid] > k`, then `low` is set to `mid` and `high` is set to `mid`. Otherwise, `low` remains unchanged, and `high` remains as either `(0 + n) // 2` or `n`. The set `st` always contains the value of `mid`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
