Output State: **`pos` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function func_2() call, `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `pos = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 0) to `pos`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `pos` is updated to 0, while `n`, `k`, `arr`, and `i` retain their original values.
