Output State: **`pos` is 3, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()` call, `i` is 3.**

Explanation: The value of `pos` is updated to be equal to the value of `i`, which is 3. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `arr`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
