Output State: **`char` is now added to the `letters` list; `digits` remains the same list of digits; `letters` now contains all its original non-digit characters plus the `char`.**

This means that the `char` which was the next character in the `password` string has been appended to the `letters` list, while the `digits` list remains unchanged. The `letters` list now includes all its original non-digit characters along with the newly added `char`.
