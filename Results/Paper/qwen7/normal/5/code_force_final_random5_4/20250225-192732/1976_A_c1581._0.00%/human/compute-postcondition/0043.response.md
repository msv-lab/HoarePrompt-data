Postcondition: `last_digit_index` is either 3 or -1, `password` is a string with at least one character, `i` is 3, `char` is the fourth character in the password. If `char` is a digit, `last_digit_index` is set to 3. If `char` is not a digit and `last_digit_index` is not -1, the function returns 'NO'.
