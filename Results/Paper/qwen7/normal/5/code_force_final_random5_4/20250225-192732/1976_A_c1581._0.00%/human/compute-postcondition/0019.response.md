Output State: **All characters from the `password` string have been processed, and `digits` contains all the digits from the `password` string while `letters` contains all the non-digit characters.**

In this final output state, the loop has iterated through every character in the `password` string exactly once. The `digits` list now holds all the digits found in the `password`, and the `letters` list contains all the non-digit characters (lowercase Latin letters) from the `password`. Neither list has any additional elements beyond those directly derived from the `password` string during the loop's execution.
