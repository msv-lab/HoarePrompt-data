Output State: **`char` is a digit; `digits` is a list containing the digit `char`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `char` (which is a digit) to the list `digits`. Since `char` is initially a digit, after appending, `digits` will contain that digit. The initial state of `char` remains unchanged, and now `digits` is a list with one element, which is the digit `char`.
