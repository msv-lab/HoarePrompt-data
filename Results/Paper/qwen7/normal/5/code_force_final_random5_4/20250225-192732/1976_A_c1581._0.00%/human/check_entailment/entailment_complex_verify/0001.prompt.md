You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program: 
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    password = data[index + 1]
    index += 2
    results.append(func_1(password))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    last_digit_index = -1
    for (i, char) in enumerate(password):
        if char.isdigit():
            last_digit_index = i
        elif last_digit_index != -1:
            return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    return 'YES'



- Annotated Code: 
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    password = data[index + 1]
    index += 2
    results.append(func_1(password))
print('\n'.join(results))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: password is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
        
    #State: All characters from the `password` string have been processed, and `digits` contains all the digits from the `password` string while `letters` contains all the non-digit characters.
    last_digit_index = -1
    for (i, char) in enumerate(password):
        if char.isdigit():
            last_digit_index = i
        elif last_digit_index != -1:
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: The function has either returned 'NO' or `last_digit_index` is equal to the length of the `password` minus one.
    if (digits != sorted(digits)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: The function has either returned 'NO' or `last_digit_index` is equal to the length of the `password` minus one, and the digits in the `password` are already sorted.
    if (letters != sorted(letters)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: The function has either returned 'NO', or `last_digit_index` is equal to the length of the `password` minus one, and the digits in the `password` are already sorted, and the letters in the `password` are not sorted.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a password string and checks if it meets certain criteria. If any of the following conditions are met, it returns 'NO': 1) The password contains a digit that is not the last character; 2) The digits in the password are not sorted in ascending order; 3) The letters in the password are not sorted in ascending order. If none of these conditions are met, it returns 'YES'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the given program to check its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits the data into a list.
   - It correctly extracts the number of test cases (`t`) and iterates over each test case.

2. **Parsing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it correctly extracts the length of the password (`n`) and the password itself.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` to validate the password.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Separation of Digits and Letters**:
     - The function correctly separates digits and letters into two lists.
   - **Checking Order of Digits**:
     - It checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order by comparing the original list of digits with the sorted version of the digits. This is correct.
   - **Checking Order of Letters**:
     - It checks if the letters are in non-decreasing order by comparing the original list of letters with the sorted version of the letters. This is also correct.
   - **Checking Digit Placement**:
     - The function checks if any digit appears after a letter. This is done by maintaining a `last_digit_index` and checking if a letter appears before this index. This logic is correct.

### Detailed Validation:

- **Digits Check**: The function correctly ensures that all digits are in non-decreasing order.
- **Letters Check**: The function correctly ensures that all letters are in non-decreasing order.
- **Digit Placement Check**: The function correctly ensures that no digit appears after a letter.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the required conditions for validating strong passwords.
