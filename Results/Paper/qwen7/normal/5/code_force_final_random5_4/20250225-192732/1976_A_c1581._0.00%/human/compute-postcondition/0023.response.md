Output State: **`last_digit_index` is 0, `password` is a string with at least one character, `i` is 1, `char` is the first character in the password, and the current value of `char` is a digit.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` (which is 0) to `last_digit_index`. All other variables remain unchanged. Since `char` was initially the first character in the password and it is a digit, these details are preserved.
