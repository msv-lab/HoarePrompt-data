Postcondition: `char` is the next character in the `password` string, `digits` is the list of digits, and `letters` is the list of non-digit characters. If `char` is a digit, it is appended to the `digits` list, and `letters` remains unchanged. If `char` is not a digit, it is added to the `letters` list, and `digits` remains unchanged.
