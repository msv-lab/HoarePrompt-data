Let's break down the given program to check its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits the data into a list.
   - It correctly extracts the number of test cases (`t`) and iterates over each test case.

2. **Parsing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it correctly extracts the length of the password (`n`) and the password itself.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` to validate the password.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Separation of Digits and Letters**:
     - The function correctly separates digits and letters into two lists.
   - **Checking Order of Digits**:
     - It checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order by comparing the original list of digits with the sorted version of the digits. This is correct.
   - **Checking Order of Letters**:
     - It checks if the letters are in non-decreasing order by comparing the original list of letters with the sorted version of the letters. This is also correct.
   - **Checking Digit Placement**:
     - The function checks if any digit appears after a letter. This is done by maintaining a `last_digit_index` and checking if a letter appears before this index. This logic is correct.

### Detailed Validation:

- **Digits Check**: The function correctly ensures that all digits are in non-decreasing order.
- **Letters Check**: The function correctly ensures that all letters are in non-decreasing order.
- **Digit Placement Check**: The function correctly ensures that no digit appears after a letter.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the required conditions for validating strong passwords.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
