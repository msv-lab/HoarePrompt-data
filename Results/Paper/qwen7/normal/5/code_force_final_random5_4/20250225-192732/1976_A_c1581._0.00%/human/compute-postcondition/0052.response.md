Output State: **The program returns 'YES'**

Given the initial conditions:
- The function has either returned 'NO'.
- `last_digit_index` is equal to the length of the `password` minus one.
- The digits in the `password` are already sorted.
- The letters in the `password` are not sorted.

The code snippet simply returns 'YES'. Since none of the initial conditions affect the return statement, the program directly returns 'YES'.
