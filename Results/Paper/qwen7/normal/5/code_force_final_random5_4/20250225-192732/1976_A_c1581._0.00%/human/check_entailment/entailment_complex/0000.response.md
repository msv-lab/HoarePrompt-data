Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
2. The `func_1` function correctly separates digits and letters from the password.
3. The function checks if there are any digits that come after a letter, which is done by ensuring that the last digit index is at the end of the password or not present.
4. The function sorts the digits and letters separately and checks if they are in non-decreasing order.
5. The logic in the function is sound and covers all the required conditions for a strong password as specified in the problem statement.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
