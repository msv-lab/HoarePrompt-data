Output State: **The function has either returned 'NO' or `last_digit_index` is equal to the length of the `password` minus one.**

In Natural Language: The loop will continue executing until it has iterated through all characters in the `password`. If at any point a digit is found and `last_digit_index` is not updated to the index of that digit, the function returns 'NO'. If the loop completes without returning, it means that the last digit in the `password` was found and `last_digit_index` is set to its index. If no digit was found throughout the entire `password`, `last_digit_index` remains -1.
