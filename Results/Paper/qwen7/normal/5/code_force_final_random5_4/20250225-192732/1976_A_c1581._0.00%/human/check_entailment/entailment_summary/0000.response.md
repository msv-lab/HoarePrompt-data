Reasoning:
1. The program reads multiple test cases from standard input and processes each one individually.
2. For each test case, it correctly extracts the length of the password and the password itself.
3. The `func_1` function is responsible for checking whether the password meets the specified criteria:
   - It separates digits and letters into two lists.
   - It ensures that no digit appears after a letter by checking if the last digit index is the last position in the password.
   - It checks if the digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. The logic in `func_1` accurately implements the rules described in the problem statement:
   - No digit should come after a letter.
   - Digits must be sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - Letters must be sorted in non-decreasing order.
5. The overall structure of the program correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the appropriate output for each.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
