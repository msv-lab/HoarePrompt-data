Output State: **`ind1` is 2, `ind2` is 0, `inpstr` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' that must contain at least one 'B', `outind` is 0, `i` is 2, `j` is the third character in `inpstr`**.

Explanation: The code `ind1 = i` assigns the value of `i`, which is 2, to `ind1`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `ind1` is updated to 2, while `ind2`, `inpstr`, `outind`, `i`, and `j` retain their original values.
