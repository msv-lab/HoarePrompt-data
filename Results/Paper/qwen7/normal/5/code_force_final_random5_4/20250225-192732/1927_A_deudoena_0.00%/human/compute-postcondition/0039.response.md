Output State: **ind1 is the index of the first 'B' in the string inpstr, ind2 is the index of the last 'B' in inpstr, inpstr is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' that must contain at least one 'B', outind is 0.**

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, `ind2` will be set to the index of the last 'B' in the string `inpstr`. The variable `ind1` remains unchanged from its initial state, as it was not modified within the loop. The variable `outind` remains 0 because it was not changed by the loop. The string `inpstr` and its length `n` remain unchanged as well.
