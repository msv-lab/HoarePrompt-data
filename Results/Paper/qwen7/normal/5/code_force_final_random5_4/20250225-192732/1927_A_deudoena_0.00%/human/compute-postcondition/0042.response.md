Functionality: **The function processes an input string `inpstr` that consists of characters 'W' and 'B', and contains at least one 'B'. It finds the index of the first 'B' (ind1) and the index of the last 'B' (ind2) in the string. After determining these indices, it prints the length of the string minus the sum of these two indices (len(inpstr) - ind1 - ind2). The function does not return any value but prints the calculated result.**
