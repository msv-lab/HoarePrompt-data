Output State: **`inpstr` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where 'W' represents a white cell and 'B' represents a black cell, with at least one 'B' in the string.**

Explanation: The code `inpstr = input()` reads a string from the input and assigns it to the variable `inpstr`. The initial conditions state that `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10\) and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B'. After executing the code, `inpstr` takes the place of `s`, but the conditions on `n` and the content of the string remain unchanged. Therefore, `inpstr` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where 'W' represents a white cell and 'B' represents a black cell, with at least one 'B' in the string.
