Output State: **ind1 is the index of the first 'B' in the string inpstr, ind2 is 0, inpstr is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' that must contain at least one 'B', outind is 0.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `ind1` will hold the index of the first occurrence of the character 'B' in the string `inpstr`. The variable `ind2` remains 0 because it is not modified within the loop. The string `inpstr` and the variable `outind` remain unchanged as they are not altered by the loop. The variable `i` will be equal to the index of the last character in `inpstr` (i.e., `n-1`), but since the final state does not require this information, it is not included in the output state description.
