Postcondition: `i` is 1, `inpstr` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' that must contain at least one 'B'. If the last character of `inpstr` (i.e., `inpstr[-1]`) is 'B', then `i` remains 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the last character of `inpstr` is not 'B', then the conditions remain as they were before the if statement.
