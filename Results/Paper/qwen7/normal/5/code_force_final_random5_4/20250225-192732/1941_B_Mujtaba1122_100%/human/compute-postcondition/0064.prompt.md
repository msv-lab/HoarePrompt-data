You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: `list` is a list of non-negative integers representing the array `a`, and `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. Each element in the list is in the range [0, 10^9].
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        
        if list[i - 1] != 0:
            print('no')
            return
        
    #State: All elements in the list are less than or equal to 0.
    if func_1(list, n) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: All elements in the list are less than or equal to 0. If `func_1(list, n)` returns True, the postcondition remains unchanged. If `func_1(list, n)` returns False, the postcondition also remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `list`, which is a list of non-negative integers, and another parameter `n`, which is an integer within the range 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The function does not return any value since there is no return statement in the provided code.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program does not return any value since there is no return statement in the provided code.

Case_2: The program returns None

Case_3: The program returns None


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
