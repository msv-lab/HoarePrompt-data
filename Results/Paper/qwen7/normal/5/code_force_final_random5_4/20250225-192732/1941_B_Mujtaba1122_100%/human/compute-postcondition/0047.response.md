Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is given by `list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0)`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 3.
   - `list[3]` is now `list[3] - 2 * list[2] - 1`.
   - `list[2]` is greater than 0.
   - `list[4]` is unchanged.
   - `list[3]` is now `list[3] - 2 * list[2] - 1`.

3. **Check each part of the loop condition**:
   - For `list[i] > 1`: Since `i` is 3, we need to check `list[3] > 1`.
   - For `list[i - 1] > 0`: Since `i` is 3, `i - 1` is 2, so we need to check `list[2] > 0`.
   - For `(list[i + 1] > 0)`: Since `i` is 3, `i + 1` is 4, so we need to check `list[4] > 0`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - We know `list[2] > 0` from the given state.
   - We need to ensure `list[4] > 0` for the loop to continue.
   - We need to ensure `list[3] > 1` for the loop to continue. Given that `list[3]` is now `list[3] - 2 * list[2] - 1`, we need to make sure this expression results in a value greater than 1.

Given that `list[2] > 0`, let's denote the initial value of `list[2]` as `x`. Therefore, `list[3] = x - 2x - 1 = -x - 1`. For `list[3] > 1`, `-x - 1 > 1`, which simplifies to `-x > 2` or `x < -2`. However, since `x` is a value in a list and typically non-negative, we need to ensure that the adjusted state still satisfies the condition. Given the context, we assume `x` is positive, so we need to ensure that the value of `list[3]` is greater than 1 after the adjustment.

Since `list[4]` is unchanged and we need it to be greater than 0, we need to ensure that `list[4] > 0`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `list[4]` must be greater than 0.
- `list[3]` must be greater than 1 after the adjustment.

State: **`i` is 3, `list[3]` is now `list[3] - 2 * list[2] - 1`, `list[2]` is greater than 0, `list[4]` must be greater than 0, and `list[3]` must be greater than 1**
