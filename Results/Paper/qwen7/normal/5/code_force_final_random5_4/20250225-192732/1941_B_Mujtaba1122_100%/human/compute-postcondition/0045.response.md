Output State: **`i` is 3; `list[3]` is decreased by 2 times `list[2]` minus 1; `list[3]` is now `list[3] - 2 * list[2] + 2`; `list[2]` is greater than 0; `list[4]` must be greater than 0; `list[4]` is unchanged; `list[4]` is decreased by `list[2] - 1`**

Explanation: The code `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]` updates `list[3]` by subtracting twice the value of `list[2]` from `list[3]`. Since `i` is 3, `i - 1` is 2. Therefore, `list[3]` is updated to `list[3] - 2 * list[2]`. Also, `list[4]` is decreased by `list[2] - 1` as per the initial conditions. All other conditions remain unchanged.
