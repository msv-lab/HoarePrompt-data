Output State: **`i` is 2; `list[2]` is greater than -1; `list[1]` is greater than 0; `list[3]` is greater than 0; `list[3]` is decreased by `list[1]; list[2]` is `list[2] - 4**.

Explanation: Initially, `list[3]` is greater than 0 and is decreased by `list[1]`. After that, `list[i]` which is `list[2]` is updated by subtracting `2 * list[i - 1]` from it. Since `i - 1` is 1, `list[2]` is updated to `list[2] - 2 * list[1]`. Given that `list[1]` is greater than 0, `list[2]` will be reduced by twice the value of `list[1]`. The condition that `list[2]` must be greater than 1 is still valid, but now it is adjusted to be greater than -1 because it has been decreased by `2 * list[1]`.
