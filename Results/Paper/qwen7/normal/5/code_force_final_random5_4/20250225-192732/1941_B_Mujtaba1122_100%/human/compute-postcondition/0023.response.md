Output State: **`i` is 2; `list[2]` is -1; `list[1]` is greater than 0; `list[3]` is greater than 0; `list[3]` is decreased by `list[1]; list[2]` is `list[2] - 4**.

Explanation: 
- Initially, `i` is 2.
- The code `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` translates to `list[2 - 1] -= 1 * list[2 - 1]`, which means `list[1] -= 1 * list[1]`.
- Since `list[1]` is greater than 0, let's denote its value as `x` (where `x > 0`). After executing the code, `list[1]` becomes `x - x = 0`.
- The other conditions remain unchanged: `list[2]` is initially greater than -1, and after the code is executed, it becomes `-1` (since `list[2] -= 4`).
- `list[3]` remains greater than 0 and is decreased by `list[1]`, but since `list[1]` is now 0, `list[3]` does not change.
- Therefore, the updated state is as described above.
