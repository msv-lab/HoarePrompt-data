Output State: **`i` is 1, `list[0]` is -2, `list[1]` is 6, `list[2]` is -3, `list[3]` is 5**

Explanation:
- Initially, `i` is 1.
- The code updates `list[i - 1]` which is `list[0]` (since `i - 1` equals 0). The new value of `list[0]` is `list[0] - 1 * list[0]`, which simplifies to `list[0] - list[0] = 0 - (-2) = -2`.
- After the operation, `list[0]` becomes -2.
- The values of `list[1]`, `list[2]`, and `list[3]` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the code.
