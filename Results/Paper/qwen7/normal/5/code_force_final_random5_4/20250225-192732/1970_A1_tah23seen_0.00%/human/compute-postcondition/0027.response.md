Output State: **`d` is a sorted list containing at least one tuple, the first tuple in `d` has `i` as `n`, `j` is some value corresponding to the first element in `d`, `ans` is increased by `s[n]`, `ans` is now `ans + s[n]`**.

In natural language: `d` remains a sorted list with its first tuple having `i` as `n`. `j` remains the same as it was before. The variable `ans` is increased by the value of `s[n]`, making `ans` equal to its previous value plus `s[n]`.
