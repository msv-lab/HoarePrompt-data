Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `(i, j) in d`. This means the loop iterates over each tuple in the list `d`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `d` is a sorted list containing at least one tuple.
   - The first tuple in `d` has `i` as `n`.
   - `j` is some value corresponding to the first element in `d`.
   - `ans` is increased by `s[n]`, and `ans` is now `ans + s[n]`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are tuples left in `d` to iterate over.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over tuples in `d`, the list `d` itself needs to be adjusted to reflect that one tuple has been processed.
   - The variable `i` will now be the `i` value of the next tuple in `d`.
   - The variable `j` will now be the `j` value of the next tuple in `d`.
   - The list `d` will be updated to exclude the first tuple since it has already been processed.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `d` is a sorted list containing at least one tuple (excluding the first tuple).
- `i` is the `i` value of the next tuple in `d`.
- `j` is the `j` value of the next tuple in `d`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`d` is a sorted list containing at least one tuple (excluding the first tuple), `i` is the `i` value of the next tuple in `d`, `j` is the `j` value of the next tuple in `d`**
