Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `len(s)`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration.
   - The variable `len(s)` is derived from the length of the string `s`, which is already given as `n`.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0, we need to ensure that `i` is initially set to 0.
   - The value of `len(s)` is `n`, so no adjustment is needed here as `n` is already provided.
   - The other variables (`s`, `ans`, and `d`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be 0.
- `n` (which is `len(s)`) remains as it is.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the length of `s`**
