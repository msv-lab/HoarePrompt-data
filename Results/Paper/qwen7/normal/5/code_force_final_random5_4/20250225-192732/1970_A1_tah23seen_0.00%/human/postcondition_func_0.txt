The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of characters "(" and ")`. It calculates the cumulative balance of parentheses as it traverses the string and constructs a new string `ans` containing only the characters from `s` that contribute to a non-negative balance. Finally, it returns the sum of all characters in the original string `s`.
