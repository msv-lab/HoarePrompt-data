Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter s, which is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")". The function returns the sum of all characters in string 's'.**

Note: In this context, since the string consists only of "(" and ")", the sum of all characters is essentially counting the total number of "(" and ")", but typically, such a function would return an integer representing this count.
