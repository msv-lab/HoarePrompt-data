Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of the time and is equal to '05', `m` is a string representing the minute part of the time, `h1` is equal to '05', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The code `h1 = '05'` assigns the string `'05'` to the variable `h1`. The value of `h` remains unchanged and is still `'05'`. All other variables (`t`, `m`, `m1`, `time`) remain in their initial states as no operations were performed on them.
