Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `h` is '02', `m` is a string representing the minute part of the time, `h1` is '02', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value '02' to `h1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
