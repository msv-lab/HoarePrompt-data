Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Variables and their values:**
   - `t`: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1440\).
   - `h`: A string representing the hour part of the time.
   - `m`: A string representing the minute part of the time.
   - `h1`: Either '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', or '11'.
   - `m1`: Equal to `m`.
   - `time`: 'AM'.

2. **Conditions for `h1`:**
   - If `h` is '01', then `h1` is '01'.
   - If `h` is not '01', then `h1` is one of '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', or '11' depending on the value of `h`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')
   ```

Given the conditions, the print statement will output the values of `h1`, `m`, and `time` concatenated together with a colon between `h1` and `m`, and a space between `m` and `time`.

Since the exact values of `h`, `m`, and `t` are not specified, we need to consider the possible values for `h1` based on the conditions provided. However, the print statement does not depend on the actual value of `h` but rather on the derived value of `h1`.

Therefore, the output will be in the format `h1 : m AM`, where `h1` is one of the specified values ('01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', or '11') and `m` is a string representing the minute part of the time.

Output: **h1 : m AM (where h1 is one of '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', or '11', and m is a string representing the minute part of the time)**
