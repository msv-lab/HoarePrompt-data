Output State: **`user_input` is `user_input - 1`, `h` is a string from the input split by ':', `m` is a string from the input split by ':', `h1` is '09', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is 'PM'**.

The code simply assigns the string `'PM'` to the variable `time`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
