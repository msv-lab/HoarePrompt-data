Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440) and a string `s` in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format. It returns "Morning" if the time is between 06:00 and 11:59, "Afternoon" if the time is between 12:00 and 17:59, "Evening" if the time is between 18:00 and 21:59, and "Night" if the time is between 22:00 and 05:59.**
