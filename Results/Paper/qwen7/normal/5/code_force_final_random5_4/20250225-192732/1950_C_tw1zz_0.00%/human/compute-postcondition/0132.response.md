Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `h` is '22', `m` is a string representing the minute part of the time, `h1` is '10', `m1` is equal to `m`, and `time` is 'PM'**.

Explanation: The line `time = 'PM'` assigns the string 'PM' to the variable `time`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
