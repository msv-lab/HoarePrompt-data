Output State: **`user_input` is `user_input - 1`, `h1` is '04', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is 'PM', `h` is a string from the input split by ':'**

Explanation: The line `time = 'PM'` assigns the string 'PM' to the variable `time`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `user_input`, `h1`, `m1`, and `h` remain unchanged from their initial states.
