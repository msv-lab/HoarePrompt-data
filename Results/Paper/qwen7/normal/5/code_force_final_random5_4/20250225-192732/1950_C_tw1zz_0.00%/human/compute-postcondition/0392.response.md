Based on the initial state provided:

- `h` is a string representing the hour part of the input.
- `m` is a string representing the minute part of the input.
- `h1` is either '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '12', or '01'.
- `m1` is equal to `m`.
- `time` is 'AM' if `h1` is '10', '11', or '12', otherwise `time` is 'PM'.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')
```

To determine the exact output, we need to consider the possible values of `h1` and `time`:

1. If `h1` is '10', '11', or '12', then `time` is 'AM'.
2. Otherwise, `time` is 'PM'.

Let's break it down into two cases:

### Case 1: `h1` is '10', '11', or '12'
- In this case, `time` is 'AM'.
- The output will be `h1 : m AM`.

### Case 2: `h1` is any other value ('01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', or '01')
- In this case, `time` is 'PM'.
- The output will be `h1 : m PM`.

Given the possible values of `h1` and `time`, the final output will be one of the following:
- `h1 : m AM` if `h1` is '10', '11', or '12'.
- `h1 : m PM` otherwise.

Since the exact value of `h1` and `m` is not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **h1 : m AM (if h1 is '10', '11', or '12') or h1 : m PM (otherwise)**
