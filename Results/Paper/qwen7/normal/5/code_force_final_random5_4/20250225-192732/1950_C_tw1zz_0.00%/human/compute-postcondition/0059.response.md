Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of the time, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the time, `h1` is '10', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is an empty string, and `h` is equal to '10'.**

The code `h1 = '10'` updates the value of `h1` to be exactly '10'. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
