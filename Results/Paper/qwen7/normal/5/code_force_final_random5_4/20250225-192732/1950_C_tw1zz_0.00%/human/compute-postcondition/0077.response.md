Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of the time and is equal to '13', `m` is a string representing the minute part of the time, `h1` is equal to '01', `m1` is equal to `m`, and `time` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The code assigns the string `'01'` to the variable `h1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
