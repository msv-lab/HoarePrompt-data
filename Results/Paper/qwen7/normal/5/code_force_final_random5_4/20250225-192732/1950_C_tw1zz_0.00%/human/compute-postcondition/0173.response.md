Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of the time, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the time, `h1` is either '10' or '11' or any hour from '01' to '13', `m1` is equal to `m`, and `time` is a string equal to 'AM'. If `h` is '10', then `h1` is '10' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '11', then `h1` is '11' and `time` is 'AM'.
