Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` will no longer be used in the program since it is not referenced anywhere after the loop. The loop processes the input time and converts it to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. The final state will have `h` being the original hour part of the input time, `m` being the original minute part of the input time, `h1` being the converted hour in 12-hour format, `m1` being equal to `m`, and `time` being 'AM' if `h1` is between '01' and '11', inclusive, and 'PM' if `h1` is '12', '01', or '02'.

In simpler terms, after processing all inputs, the variables will reflect the converted time in 12-hour format along with the appropriate AM/PM indicator based on the original 24-hour format input.
