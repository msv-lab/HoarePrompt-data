Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `h` is a string representing the hour part of the time, `m` is a string representing the minute part of the time, `h1` is either '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', or '11', `m1` is equal to `m`, and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '06', then `h1` is '06' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is not '06', then `h1` is '07', '08', '09', '10', or '11' (depending on the value of `h`) and `time` is 'AM'.
