Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `h` is '11', `m` is a string representing the minute part of the time, `h1` is '11', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is an empty string, and `h` is not equal to '10'**.

Explanation: The code `h1 = '11'` assigns the string `'11'` to the variable `h1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
