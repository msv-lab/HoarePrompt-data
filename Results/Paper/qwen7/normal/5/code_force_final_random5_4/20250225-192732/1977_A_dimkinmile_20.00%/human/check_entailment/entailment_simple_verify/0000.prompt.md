You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and each test case consists of two positive integers n and m such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if (n >= m) :
        print('Yes')
        #This is printed: Yes
    else :
        print('No')
        #This is printed: No
    #State: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer, and `m` is an input integer. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, the program does not change the values of `n` and `m`. If `n` is less than `m`, the program does not change the values of `n` and `m` either.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the cases where the number of moves `n` is odd and the desired number of cubes `m` is less than `n`. According to the problem description, Nikita can either add or remove one cube per move. Therefore, after an odd number of moves, the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of cubes will be different from the initial state (which starts with 0 cubes, an even number).

For example, consider the test case where `n = 5` and `m = 2`. Since `n` is odd, the final number of cubes should be odd (starting from 0, adding or removing one cube 5 times results in an odd number of cubes), but the program incorrectly outputs "Yes" because it only checks if `n >= m`.

To fix this, the program should check the parity of `n` and ensure that `m` has the same parity as `n` (both odd or both even). Here's a corrected version:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m and (n % 2 == m % 2):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This version ensures that the final number of cubes matches the parity required by the number of moves.
