Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining whether it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Specifically:

1. The function `func_1()` is defined but never called within the loop where the number of test cases is processed.
2. The condition `if n >= m:` is not sufficient to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes. For example, if `n = 2` and `m = 4`, the condition `n >= m` fails, but it should still be possible to add 2 cubes to the tower (which would result in 2 cubes, not 4).

To fix this, the logic inside `func_1()` should check if the difference between `n` and `m` is even because each pair of moves (one add and one remove) cancels out to zero net change in the number of cubes. Here is the corrected version:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This version checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even, which is necessary and sufficient for determining if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
