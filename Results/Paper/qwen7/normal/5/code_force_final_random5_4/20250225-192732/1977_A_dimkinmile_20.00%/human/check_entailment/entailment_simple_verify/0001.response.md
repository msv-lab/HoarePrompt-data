### Your Response:
Reasoning: 

The original assessment accurately describes the logic and flow of the program. Let's break down the program and verify it step by step using the provided annotations:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The variable `kreker` is initialized with an integer value representing the number of test cases.
   - A loop runs for `kreker` iterations, where each iteration calls the function `func_1()`.
   - This part is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - Inside `func_1`, two integers `n` and `m` are read using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - The condition `if n >= m:` checks if the number of moves `n` is greater than or equal to the desired number of cubes `m`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints 'Yes'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.
   - This part is also correct and matches the problem description.

3. **Annotations:**
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after each function call.
   - The postcondition for `func_1` states that the values of `n` and `m` are not changed, which is accurate since the function only reads and prints values without modifying them.

4. **Overall Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly determines whether it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves based on the condition `n >= m`.
   - The function `func_1` is called `kreker` times, which matches the number of test cases, ensuring all test cases are processed.
   - The input handling and output format match the problem statement requirements.

Given this detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.
