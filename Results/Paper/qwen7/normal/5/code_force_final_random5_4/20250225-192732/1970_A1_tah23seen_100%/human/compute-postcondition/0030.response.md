Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variables `i`, `j`, and `d`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `d` is not empty.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is `ans` plus `s[i]`.
   - `i` is the second value of the next tuple in `d`.
   - `j` is the second value of the next tuple in `d`.
   - `d` is a non-empty list of tuples sorted by the maximum depth of nested parentheses and then by negative index.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `d` is a list of tuples and the loop continues until `d` is empty, the next tuple in `d` will be used.
   - After processing the current tuple `(i, j)` from `d`, the next tuple will be taken. Therefore, `i` and `j` will be updated to the values of the second elements of the next tuple in `d`.
   - `d` will be updated to remove the first tuple since it has been processed.

Given these points, let's update the states for the next iteration:

- `ans` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.
- `i` and `j` will be updated to the values of the second elements of the next tuple in `d`.
- `d` will be updated to remove the first tuple.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`ans` is `ans` plus `s[i]`, `i` is the second value of the next tuple in `d`, `j` is the second value of the next tuple in `d`, `d` is a non-empty list of tuples sorted by the maximum depth of nested parentheses and then by negative index, but with the first tuple removed**.
