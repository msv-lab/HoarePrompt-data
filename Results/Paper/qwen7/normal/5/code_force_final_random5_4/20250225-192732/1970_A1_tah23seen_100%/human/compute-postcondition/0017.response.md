Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given code are `i` and `s`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(s)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `len(s)` is `n`
   - `d[2]` is either `d[1] + 1` if `s[i] == '('`, or `d[1] - 1` if `s[i] != '('`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - `len(s)` remains unchanged as it is determined by the length of the string `s` and does not change within the loop.
   - `d[2]` will be updated based on the value of `s[i]` (which is now `s[2]`), but since we don't know the exact value of `s[2]`, we can only say that `d[2]` will be either `d[1] + 1` if `s[2] == '('`, or `d[1] - 1` if `s[2] != '('`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `len(s)` is `n`, `d[2]` is either `d[1] + 1` if `s[2] == '('`, or `d[1] - 1` if `s[2] != '('`**
