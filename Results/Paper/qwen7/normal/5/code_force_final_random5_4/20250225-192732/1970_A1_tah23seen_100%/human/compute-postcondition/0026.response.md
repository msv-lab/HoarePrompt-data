Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the tuple `(i, j)` where `i` and `j` are the variables used in the loop.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**: From the given state, we know that `i` is `n-1` and `d` is a list of tuples sorted by the maximum depth of nested parentheses and then by negative index.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `d`. Therefore, the list `d` must contain at least one tuple.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Since the loop depends on the list `d` having at least one element, we need to ensure that `d` is not empty. Additionally, `i` and `j` will be set to the values from the first tuple in the list `d`.

5. **Formulate the final state**: Based on the above points, the state should reflect that `d` is a non-empty list of tuples, and `i` and `j` are initialized to the values from the first tuple in `d`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is the first value of the first tuple in `d`, `j` is the second value of the first tuple in `d`, `d` is a non-empty list of tuples sorted by the maximum depth of nested parentheses and then by negative index**
