Output State: **`i` is 1; `len(s)` is `n`; `d[i + 1]` is `d[2]` and its value is `d[1] + 1`**

Explanation: The code `d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1` updates the dictionary `d` such that the key `i + 1` (which is 2 since `i` is 1) is assigned the value of `d[i] + 1` (which is `d[1] + 1`). The other variables remain unchanged.
