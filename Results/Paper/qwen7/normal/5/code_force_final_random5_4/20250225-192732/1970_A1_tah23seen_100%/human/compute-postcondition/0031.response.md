Output State: **`ans` is `ans` plus `s[i]`; `i` is the second value of the next tuple in `d`; `j` is the second value of the next tuple in `d`; `d` is a non-empty list of tuples sorted by the maximum depth of nested parentheses and then by negative index, but with the first tuple removed.**

Explanation: The code `ans += s[i]` increments the value of `ans` by `s[i]`. The value of `i` and `j` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. The list `d` remains the same as well, since the code does not modify it.
