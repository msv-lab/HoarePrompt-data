Reasoning:
1. The program correctly defines the `func_1` function which is responsible for performing the balanced shuffle operation on the input string.
2. The function first computes the balance of the prefix at each position and stores these values in a dictionary `d`.
3. After removing the entry for the full length of the string (which is not needed for sorting), it sorts the dictionary items based on the balance (prefix balance) and position.
4. It then constructs the output string `ans` by concatenating characters from the original string `s` at the positions specified by the sorted dictionary keys.
5. The function returns the constructed string `ans`.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the function `func_1` correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
