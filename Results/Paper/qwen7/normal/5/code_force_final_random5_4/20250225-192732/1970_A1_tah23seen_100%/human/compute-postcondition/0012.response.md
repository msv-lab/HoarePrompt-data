Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in this case is `i`, and it ranges from `0` to `len(s) - 1`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < len(s)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `len(s)` is `n`.

4. **Loop body effect**: The loop body sets `d[i + 1]` based on the value of `s[i]`. Specifically:
   - If `s[i]` is `(`, then `d[i + 1]` is set to 1.
   - Otherwise, `d[i + 1]` is set to `d[0] - 1`.

5. **Next iteration requirements**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` should be set to 1.
   - `len(s)` remains `n` because it does not change within the loop.

6. **Adjusting the state**:
   - `i` needs to be 1.
   - `len(s)` remains `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `len(s)` is `n`**.
