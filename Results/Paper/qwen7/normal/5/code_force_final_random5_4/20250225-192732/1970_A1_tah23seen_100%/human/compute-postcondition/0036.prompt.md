You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")". The string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
        
    #State: Output State: The final state of the loop after all iterations will be: `i` is `n-1`, `len(s)` is `n`, and `d[n]` will be the final value of the depth calculation based on the sequence of parentheses in the string `s`. Specifically, `d[n]` will be the maximum depth of nested parentheses in the string `s`. The variable `ans` remains an empty string as it was not affected by the loop.
    #
    #This means that after the loop completes, `d[n]` will reflect the deepest level of nesting of parentheses in the string `s`, starting from 0 and incrementing or decrementing based on encountering '(' or ')'.
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is the concatenation of all `s[i]` values for each tuple `(i, j)` in `d`, `i` is `n-1`, `len(s)` is `n`, `d` is an empty list of tuples, and `ans` is a string containing all characters from `s` indexed by the first elements of tuples in `d` in the order they appeared.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `ans` will contain every character from the string `s` that corresponds to the indices specified in the tuples of `d`. The variable `i` will be set to `n-1`, indicating it has reached the end of the string. The list `d` will be empty because all tuples have been processed.
    return ans
    #The program returns an empty string 'ans', since `d` is an empty list of tuples and there are no indices from `s` to concatenate.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")". The function returns an empty string 'ans' because `d` is an empty list of tuples and there are no indices from `s` to concatenate.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns an empty string 'ans', since `d` is an empty list of tuples and there are no indices from `s` to concatenate.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
