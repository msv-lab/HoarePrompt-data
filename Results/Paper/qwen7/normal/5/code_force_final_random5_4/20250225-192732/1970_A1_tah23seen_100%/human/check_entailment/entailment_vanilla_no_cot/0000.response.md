Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the solution sorts the keys of the dictionary `d` based on the prefix balance and position, but it does not handle the sorting of the entire table as required. The solution only sorts the keys of the dictionary and does not reorder the characters based on the sorted keys. 

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = []
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d.append((i, 1))
        else:
            d.append((i, -1))
    d.sort(key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, _) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans

n = input()
print(func_1(n))
```

This corrected version creates a list of tuples where each tuple contains the index and the balance change (`1` for an opening parenthesis and `-1` for a closing parenthesis). It then sorts this list according to the rules specified in the problem statement and constructs the balanced shuffle sequence accordingly.
