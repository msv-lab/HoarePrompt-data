Output State: **`i` is 2, `len(s)` is `n`, `d[2]` is `d[1] - 1`, `d[3]` is `d[2] - 1`**

Explanation: Initially, `i` is 2, `len(s)` is `n`, and `d[2]` is either `d[1] + 1` if `s[2] == '('`, or `d[1] - 1` if `s[2] != '('`. After executing `d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1`, `d[3]` is updated to `d[2] - 1`. Since the value of `d[2]` is already defined, it becomes `d[1] - 1` (whether `s[2] == '('` or `s[2] != '('`). Therefore, `d[3]` is now `d[1] - 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
