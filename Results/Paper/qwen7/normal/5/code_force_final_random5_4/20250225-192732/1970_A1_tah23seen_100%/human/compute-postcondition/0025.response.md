Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `len(s)` is `n`, `d` is a list of tuples sorted by the maximum depth of nested parentheses and then by negative index, and `ans` remains an empty string.**

Explanation: The code sorts the dictionary `d` into a list of tuples based on two keys: the value of the depth (`x[1]`) and the negative index (`-x[0]`). Since `d.pop(n)` removed the element at index `n`, the length of `d` is now one less than before. The sorting does not affect the values of `i`, `len(s)`, or `ans`.
