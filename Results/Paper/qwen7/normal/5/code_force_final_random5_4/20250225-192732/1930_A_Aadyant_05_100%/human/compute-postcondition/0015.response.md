Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be at least 1, `num` is 0, `s` is 0, `list2` contains the integer value of the third element in `list1`, `a` is an input string, `b` is a non-empty input string, `list1` is the split result of `b` and must have at least three elements, `str` is the third element in `list1`, `list2` has the integer value of `str` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the integer value of the third element in `list1` (which is stored in `str`) to `list2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
