Output State: **`list2` is a sorted version of the original `list1`, `i` is equal to the length of `list2`, `s` is the sum of the elements of `list2` at even indices, `final` contains the sum of elements at even indices of `list2`.**

Explanation: The code appends the sum of elements at even indices of `list2` to the list `final`. Since the loop has completed all its iterations, `i` now equals the length of `list2`, and `s` contains the sum of elements at even indices of `list2`. The other variables remain in their previous states.
