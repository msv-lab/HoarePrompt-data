Based on the initial state provided, `final` must contain at least one element. Since no specific value or type for the elements in `final` is given, we can only state that `final` contains at least one element.

However, since the print statement simply outputs `fin` without any formatting or additional context, the output will be the value of the variable `final`.

Output: **fin (where fin is a list containing at least one element)**
