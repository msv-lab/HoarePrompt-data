Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for num in range(int(n))`. The variables involved in the loop head are `num` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `num < int(n)`.

3. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `s` is the sum of `list2` at even indices.
   - `t` retains its value.
   - `n` retains its value.
   - `num` retains its value.
   - `a` retains its value.
   - `b` retains its value.
   - `list1` retains its value.
   - `final` contains the sum `s`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop depends on `num` and `int(n)`, we need to update `num` to be incremented by 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is used to determine the upper limit of the range.
   - `s`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `list1`, and `final` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `num` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - All other variables (`s`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `list1`, and `final`) retain their values.

Given that `num` was previously some value (let's call it `prev_num`), after the increment, `num` will be `prev_num + 1`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`s` is the sum of `list2` at even indices, `t` retains its value, `n` retains its value, `num` is `prev_num + 1`, `a` retains its value, `b` retains its value, `list1` retains its value, and `final` contains the sum `s`.**

For simplicity, if we denote the previous value of `num` as `prev_num`, the final state can be summarized as:
State: **`s` is the sum of `list2` at even indices, `t` retains its value, `n` retains its value, `num` is `prev_num + 1`, `a` retains its value, `b` retains its value, `list1` retains its value, and `final` contains the sum `s`.**
