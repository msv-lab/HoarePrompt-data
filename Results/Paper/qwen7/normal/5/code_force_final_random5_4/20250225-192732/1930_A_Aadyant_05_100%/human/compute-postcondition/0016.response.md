Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be at least 1, `num` is 0, `s` is 0, `list2` contains the integer values of all elements in `list1`, `a` is an input string, `b` is a non-empty input string, `list1` is the split result of `b` and must have at least as many elements as there were iterations of the loop, `str` is the current element in `list1` being processed.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `list2` will contain the integer conversion of every string in `list1`. The variables `t`, `n`, `num`, `s`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial or previous states, with `b` still being a non-empty input string and `list1` being its split result.
