Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `n` which is expected to be the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (which is actually the number of pairs of numbers, so the total number of integers is `2n`).
   - It then reads a line containing `2n` space-separated integers.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The program initializes a variable `s` to 0, which will store the score.
   - It initializes an empty list `list2` to store the sorted integers.
   - It splits the input string into individual integers and converts them to a list of integers (`list2`).
   - It sorts the list `list2`.
   - It iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, summing up the elements at even indices (since the list is sorted, these represent the minimum of each pair).

3. **Output**:
   - The score `s` is appended to the list `final` for each test case.
   - Finally, it prints all the scores stored in `final`.

### Correctness Check

1. **Sorting and Pairing**:
   - Sorting the list ensures that we always pick the smallest available number in each pair, which is the optimal strategy to maximize the score.
   - Summing up every other element (after sorting) correctly implements the strategy of picking the minimum of each pair.

2. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The program correctly processes each test case separately and stores the results in a list `final`.
   - It then prints the results for each test case.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the input format as specified in the problem statement.
   - It correctly processes the sorting and pairing logic for each test case.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program outputs the results in the correct order, corresponding to each test case.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It sorts the numbers, pairs them optimally, and calculates the maximum score as required.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
