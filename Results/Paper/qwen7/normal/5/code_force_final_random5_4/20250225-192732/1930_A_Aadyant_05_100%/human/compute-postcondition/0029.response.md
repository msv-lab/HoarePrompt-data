Output State: **`s` is 0, `t` retains its value, `n` retains its value, `num` is `prev_num + 1`, `a` retains its value, `b` retains its value, `list1` retains its value, `final` contains the sum 0, `list2` is an empty list.**

The code creates an empty list named `list2`. No other variables are affected, so their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
