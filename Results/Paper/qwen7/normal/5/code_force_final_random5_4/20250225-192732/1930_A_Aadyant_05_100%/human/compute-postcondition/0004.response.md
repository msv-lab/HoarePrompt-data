Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be at least 1, `num` is 0, `s` is 0, `list2` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `list2`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `num`, or `s`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions, and `list2` is the only new variable introduced with a specific state.
