Output State: `list1` must be empty or contain all its original strings, `str` will have iterated through each string in `list1` and been assigned the last string in `list1` if `list1` is not empty, `list2` will contain the integer representation of every string in `list1`, with each integer appended sequentially to form a list.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `list1` will be empty because all its strings have been processed. The variable `list2` will contain a list of integers, where each integer is the converted numeric value of each string from `list1`, in the order they appeared in `list1`.
