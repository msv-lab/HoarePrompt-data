Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `num` is a positive integer, `out` is an empty list, `list1` is an empty list, `list2` is an empty list, `a` is converted to an integer and assigned to `a`.**

Explanation: The code `a = int(a)` converts the input string `a` to an integer and assigns it back to `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
