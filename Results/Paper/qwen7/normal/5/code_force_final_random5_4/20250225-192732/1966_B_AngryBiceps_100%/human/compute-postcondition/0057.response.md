Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. This means the loop will run based on the integer value of the input provided by the user.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being the input provided by the user at each iteration.
   - `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each element in `a`, concatenated together.
   - `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each element in `a`, concatenated together.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `n` is the integer value of the first input provided by the user.
   - `m` is the integer value of the second input provided by the user.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - The loop will execute again if the user provides another integer input.
   - After the current iteration, `i` will be decremented by 1 because `i` starts from `n - 1` and decreases by 1 with each iteration.
   - The value of `n` and `m` will remain the same unless they are updated within the loop body, but since no such updates are mentioned, they stay the same.
   - The list `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.

Given these points, let's adjust the states for the next iteration:

- The user will provide another integer input, which will be used to determine how many times the loop should run.
- `i` will be `n - 2` (decremented by 1 from the previous value).
- `n` and `m` remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**State: `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being the input provided by the user at each iteration; `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each element in `a`, concatenated together; `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each element in `a`, concatenated together; `i` is `n - 2`; `n` is the integer value of the first input provided by the user; `m` is the integer value of the second input provided by the user.**
