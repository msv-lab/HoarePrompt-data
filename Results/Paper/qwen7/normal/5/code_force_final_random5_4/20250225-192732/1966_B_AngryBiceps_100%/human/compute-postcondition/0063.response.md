Output State: **`a` is a list containing one element which is the input provided by the user, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string, `i` is `n - 2`.**

The code appends the input provided by the user to the list `a`. The other variables (`first_row`, `last_row`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
