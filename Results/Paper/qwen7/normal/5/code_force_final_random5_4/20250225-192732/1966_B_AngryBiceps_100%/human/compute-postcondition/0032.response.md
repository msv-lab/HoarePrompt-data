Output State: **`a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `last_row` is an empty string, `i` is `n`, `n` is the integer value of the first input provided by the user, and `m` is the integer value of the second input provided by the user.**

The code `last_row = ''` simply assigns an empty string to the variable `last_row`. This does not affect any other variables, so their states remain unchanged.
