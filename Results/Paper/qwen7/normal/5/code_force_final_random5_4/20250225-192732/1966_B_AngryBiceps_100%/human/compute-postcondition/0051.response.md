Output: **NO**

Explanation:
- `a` is a list containing `n` elements, where each element is an input provided by the user.
- `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each element in `a`, concatenated together.
- `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each element in `a`, concatenated together.
- `i` is set to `n - 1`.
- `n` is the integer value of the first input provided by the user.
- `m` is the integer value of the second input provided by the user.

Given the initial state, the `print('NO')` statement directly prints the string `'NO'` without any dependency on the values of `first_row`, `last_row`, `i`, `n`, or `m`. Therefore, the output is simply **NO**.
