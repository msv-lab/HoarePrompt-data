Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a list containing one element which is the input provided by the user.
   - `first_row` is the first character of the last element in `a`.
   - `last_row` is the last character of the last element in `a`.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `n` is the integer value of the first input provided by the user.
   - `m` is the integer value of the second input provided by the user.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `n`.
   - Since `i` is now `n`, the loop will check the condition `i < n`. This condition will be false, meaning the loop will terminate if it reaches this point. However, the question asks for the state at the start of the next iteration, which would be right before the loop checks the condition.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented from `n-1` to `n`.
   - `n` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**`a` is a list containing one element which is the input provided by the user, `first_row` is the first character of the last element in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the last element in `a`, `i` is `n`, `n` is the integer value of the first input provided by the user, `m` is the integer value of the second input provided by the user.**

State: **`a` is a list containing one element which is the input provided by the user, `first_row` is the first character of the last element in `a`, `last_row` is the last character of the last element in `a`, `i` is `n`, `n` is the integer value of the first input provided by the user, `m` is the integer value of the second input provided by the user.**
