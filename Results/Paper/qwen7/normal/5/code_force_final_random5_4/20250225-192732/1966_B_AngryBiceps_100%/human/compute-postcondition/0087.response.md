Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a grid of size n x m where n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500. Each cell in the grid contains either 'W' or 'B'. The function also accepts an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it returns a result based on the grid configuration.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each involving a grid of specified dimensions filled with 'W' and 'B'. It processes these grids according to some unspecified logic and returns different results for each test case, with the total number of test cases being limited to 10^4.
