Output State: **`a` is a list containing two elements, where the first element is the initial input provided by the user and the second element is the new input provided by the user; `first_row` is the first character of the last element in the list `a`; `last_row` is the last character of the last element in the list `a`; `i` is `n - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(input())` appends a new input provided by the user to the list `a`. Since `a` initially contains one element (the first input), after appending, `a` will contain two elements: the initial input and the new input. The values of `first_row` and `last_row` depend on the last element in the updated list `a`, and `i` remains unchanged as it was set to `n - 1` before the append operation.
