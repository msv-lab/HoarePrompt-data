Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly identifies the conditions under which it would be impossible to make all squares in the grid the same color.
2. It checks if the first and last rows are uniform but different, and if the first and last characters of each row are uniform but different.
3. These conditions are sufficient to determine whether it's possible to make all squares the same color using the allowed operations.
4. The logic is sound and covers the necessary cases to determine the outcome for each test case.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the program correctly implements the solution.

Correctness: **True**
