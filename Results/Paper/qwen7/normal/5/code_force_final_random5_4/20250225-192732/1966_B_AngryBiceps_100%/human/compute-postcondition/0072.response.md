Output State: **`a` is a list containing three elements, where the first element is the initial input provided by the user, the second element is the new input provided by the user, and the third element is the current input provided by the user; `first_row` is the first character of the last element in the list `a` concatenated with the first character of the last element in `a`, plus the first character of the last element in `a`; `last_row` is the last character of the last element in the list `a` concatenated with the last character of the last element in `a`; `i` is `n - 2`.**

Explanation: The code `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last element in the list `a` to `first_row`. Since `a[-1][0]` refers to the first character of the last element in the list `a`, `first_row` is updated by concatenating its current value with this first character. All other variables remain unchanged.
