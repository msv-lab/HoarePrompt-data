Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current Values**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `n` is the integer value of the first input provided by the user.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `for i in range(n)`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` starts from `n` and the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, `i` will be `n + 1` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the range and does not change within the loop.

5. **Update the States**:
   - `a`: No change needed as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `first_row`: No change needed as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `last_row`: No change needed as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i`: Incremented by 1 from `n` to `n + 1`.
   - `n`: Remains the same.

Given this analysis, the updated states at the start of the next iteration are:

State: **`a` is a list containing two elements, the first element is the input provided by the user initially, the second element is the current input provided by the user; `first_row` is the concatenation of the first character of the last element in `a` and the first character of the last element in `a`; `last_row` is the last character of the last element in `a` plus the last character of the last element in `a`; `i` is `n + 1`; `n` is the integer value of the first input provided by the user**.
