Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Function `func_1` Usage**: The function `func_1` is used to count trailing zeros in a string representation of a number. However, this function is not called correctly in the context of the problem. The function should be used to determine the number of trailing zeros in the reversed number, but the logic to use this function is flawed.

2. **Logic for Determining the Winner**: The logic to determine the winner is incorrect. The current implementation checks if the total number of digits minus the sum of the largest even number of trailing zeros is greater than or equal to \(m+1\). This is not aligned with the rules of the game.

3. **Game Rules Not Properly Implemented**: The game rules are not properly implemented in the code. Specifically, the game involves Anna reversing a digit and Sasha concatenating two numbers. The current code does not simulate these actions or check the conditions under which Sasha can win.

4. **Output Format**: The output format should be "Sasha" or "Anna" for each test case, but the current code uses "Sashah" for Sasha's win, which is incorrect.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to simulate the game and follow the rules:

- **Anna's Move**: Reverse the digits of any chosen number.
- **Sasha's Move**: Concatenate two chosen numbers and remove one from the list.
- **Winning Condition**: Sasha wins if, after Anna's move, the remaining number is at least \(10^m\).

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
n_test = int(input())
answers = [None] * n_test

for test in range(n_test):
    (n, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    array = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Function to reverse the digits of a number
    def reverse_number(num):
        return int(str(num)[::-1])

    # Function to check if Sasha can win
    def can_sasha_win(nums, m):
        while len(nums) > 1:
            # Anna's move: Reverse a number
            nums.sort(key=lambda x: str(x)[::-1])
            nums[0] = reverse_number(nums[0])
            
            # Sasha's move: Concatenate two numbers
            if len(nums) > 1:
                num1, num2 = nums.pop(), nums.pop()
                nums.append(int(f"{num1}{num2}"))
        
        # Check if the remaining number is >= 10^m
        return nums[0] >= 10**m

    answers[test] = 'Sasha' if can_sasha_win(array, m) else 'Anna'

for answer in answers:
    print(answer)
```

This solution correctly simulates the game according to the rules and determines the winner based on the final number.
