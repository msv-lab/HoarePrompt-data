Output State: **`i` is 2**.

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, starting from 1, making it 2. The conditions specified in the initial state (if `l[i]` equals `i + 2` and `l[i + 1]` equals `i + 1`) are not relevant to the given code snippet, which only increments `i`. Therefore, these conditions remain as part of the precondition but are not altered by the code.
