Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `range(int(input()))` expression. This means the loop will iterate based on the integer input provided by the user.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition is that `i` is equal to `n`, and `j` is either 0 or 1, but `j` remains 0 because the specified condition was never met.

3. **Determine the next state**: For the loop to execute one more time, the user must provide an input that changes the value of `n` (which is the upper limit of the range). Since `i` is equal to `n` at the end of the previous iteration, the next iteration will increment `i` to `n + 1`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: 
   - The variable `i` will be incremented by 1, so if `i` was equal to `n` before, it will now be `n + 1`.
   - The variable `j` will remain 0 because the condition `l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1` was never met, and there is no indication that `j` will change unless the condition is met.

5. **Formulate the new state**: The new state should reflect the updated values of `i` and `j`.

Given these steps, the new state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 0**
