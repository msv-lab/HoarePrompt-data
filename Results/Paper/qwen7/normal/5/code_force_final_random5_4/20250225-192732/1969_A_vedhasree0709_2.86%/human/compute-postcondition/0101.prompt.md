Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and p is a list of n integers where each p_i satisfies 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    i = 0
    j = 0
    while i <= n - 1:
        if l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1:
            print(2)
            j = 1
            break
        i += 1
    if j == 0:
        print(3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is 1, `n` must be at least 4, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, and the conditions `l[i-1] == i + 1` and `l[i-2] == i + 2` are met for some `i` between 0 and `n-1`. Since the condition `j == 0` is true, the if part is executed, and the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is either 0 or 1, and the value of `j` remains 0 because the condition `l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1` was never met for any `i` within the range of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is either 0 or 1. If during any iteration of the loop, the condition `l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1` was met, then `j` is set to 1. Otherwise, `j` remains 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
