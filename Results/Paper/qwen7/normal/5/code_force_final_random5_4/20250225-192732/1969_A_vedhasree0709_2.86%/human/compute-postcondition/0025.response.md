Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 4, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1. If `l[2]` equals 4 and `l[3]` equals 3, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.
