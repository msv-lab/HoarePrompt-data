Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Condition Check**: The program checks for a specific condition `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`, which is not aligned with the problem statement. The problem requires finding pairs of friends who are each other's best friends and ensuring both receive invitations.

2. **Handling of Best Friends**: The program does not properly handle the logic to find pairs of best friends who need to be invited together. Instead, it looks for a specific sequence that does not exist in the problem constraints.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program fails to handle edge cases, such as when no pair of best friends can be found that satisfy the condition, or when the minimum number of invitations required is more than 2.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
