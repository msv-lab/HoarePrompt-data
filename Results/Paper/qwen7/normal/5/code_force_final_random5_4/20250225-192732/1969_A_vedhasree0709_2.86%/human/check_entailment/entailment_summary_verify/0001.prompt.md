You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        i = 0
        j = 0
        while i <= n - 1:
            if l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1:
                print(2)
                j = 1
                break
            i += 1
        if j == 0:
            print(3)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list `l` of length `n`. For each test case, it checks if there exists an index `i` where `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`. If such an index is found, it prints `2`; otherwise, it prints `3`. The function does not return a value but prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `l`.

2. **Logic Implementation**:
   - The program uses a `while` loop to iterate through the list `l` up to `n-1`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the current friend `i` and the next friend `i+1` form a pair where `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`.
     - If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and sets `j` to `1`, indicating that at least 2 friends can be invited.
     - If no such pair is found after the loop, it prints `3`.

3. **Problem Description Analysis**:
   - The problem states that each friend's best friend is distinct and not themselves.
   - The goal is to find the minimum number of invitations needed so that at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - A friend comes to the party if both the friend and their best friend receive invitations.

### Issues with the Provided Program:

1. **Incorrect Pair Checking**:
   - The condition `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1` does not correctly represent the problem constraints.
   - The correct condition should check if `l[i] == i + 1` and `l[i + 1] == i`.

2. **Handling All Cases**:
   - The program only checks for a specific pair and does not handle all possible configurations of friends and their best friends.
   - The logic should consider all possible pairs and ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party.

### Correct Solution:

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider all possible pairs and ensure that at least 2 friends are invited. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        invited = set()
        
        # Check all pairs
        for i in range(n):
            if i + 1 in invited:
                continue
            if l[i] - 1 in invited:
                continue
            invited.add(i + 1)
            invited.add(l[i])
        
        # Ensure at least 2 friends are invited
        if len(invited) < 2:
            print(3)
        else:
            print(len(invited))
```

### Conclusion:

The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle all possible configurations of friends and their best friends. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
