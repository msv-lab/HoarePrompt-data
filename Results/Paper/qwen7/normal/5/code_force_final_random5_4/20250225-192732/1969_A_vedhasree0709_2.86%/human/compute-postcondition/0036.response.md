Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a single line of input, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `l`. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it was just an input integer before this operation.
