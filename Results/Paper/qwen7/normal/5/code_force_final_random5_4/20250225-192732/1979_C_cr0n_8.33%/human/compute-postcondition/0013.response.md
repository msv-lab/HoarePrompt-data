Based on the initial state provided:

- `vals` is an empty list.
- `vprod` is an empty list.
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `N` is an input integer where \(1 \leq N \leq 50\).
- `prod` is the product of all elements in the list `vals`. Since `vals` is empty, `prod` is 1.
- `den` is `prod - sum(vprod)`. Since both `vals` and `vprod` are empty lists, `sum(vprod)` is 0, and thus `den` is `1 - 0 = 1`.

However, it is also stated that `den` is less than or equal to 0. Given that `den` is calculated as 1, this condition cannot be satisfied unless there is an external factor or a different interpretation of the state that is not explicitly mentioned. But based on the given information, `den` should be 1, which contradicts the condition that `den` is less than or equal to 0.

Given the explicit print statement and the conditions provided, the print statement will directly output `-1` without any dependency on the values of `prod` or `den`.

Output: **-1**
