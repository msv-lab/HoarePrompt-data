Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires distributing coins among different outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` correctly reads the necessary inputs (`N` and the list `vals`).
   - It calculates the product of all elements in `vals` and stores it in `prod`.
   - It then computes a new list `vprod` where each element is `prod` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`.
   - The variable `den` is calculated as `prod - sum(vprod)`.
   - If `den` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints `-1` and returns, indicating no valid distribution exists.
   - Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` as a space-separated string.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic to calculate `vprod` ensures that the sum of `vprod` is equal to `prod - den`.
   - Since `den` is defined as `prod - sum(vprod)`, if `den` is greater than 0, the sum of `vprod` is indeed less than `prod`, which means the total bet is less than the potential winnings for any outcome.
   - The function handles the case where no valid distribution exists by printing `-1` and returning, which is correct according to the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the function correctly implements the required logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
