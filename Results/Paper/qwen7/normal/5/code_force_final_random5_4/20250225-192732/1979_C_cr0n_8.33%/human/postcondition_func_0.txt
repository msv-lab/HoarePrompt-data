The function reads two lines of input. The first line contains an integer \(N\), and the second line contains \(N\) space-separated integers stored in a list `vals`. It then calculates the product of all elements in `vals` and stores it in `prod`. Next, it computes a new list `vprod` where each element is `prod` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`. After that, it calculates `den` as `prod` minus the sum of all elements in `vprod`. If `den` is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1` and returns. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` as a space-separated string. The function ultimately returns `None`.
