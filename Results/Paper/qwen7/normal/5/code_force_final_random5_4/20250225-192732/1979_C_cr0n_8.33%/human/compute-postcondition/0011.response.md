Output State: **`vals` is an empty list, `vprod` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an input integer where \(1 \leq N \leq 50\), `prod` is the product of all elements in the list `vals`, `den` is `prod - sum(vprod)`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `den` as the difference between `prod` (which is initially the product of all elements in the list `vals`, and since `vals` is empty, `prod` is 1) and `sum(vprod)`. Since `vprod` is also an empty list, `sum(vprod)` is 0. Therefore, `den` is `1 - 0 = 1`. However, since the question asks to include all the information of the precondition that is still valid, we keep the initial conditions of `vals`, `vprod`, `t`, and `N` as they are.
