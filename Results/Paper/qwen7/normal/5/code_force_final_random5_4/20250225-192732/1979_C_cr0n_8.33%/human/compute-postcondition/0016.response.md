Based on the initial state provided:

- `vals` is an empty list.
- `vprod` is an empty list.
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `N` is an input integer where \(1 \leq N \leq 50\).
- `prod` is the product of all elements in the list `vals`, but since `vals` is empty, `prod` is 1.
- `den` is `prod - sum(vprod)`, and since both `prod` and `sum(vprod)` are 0 (because `vals` and `vprod` are empty lists), `den` is 1 (as stated, `den` is greater than 0).

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
```

Since `vprod` is an empty list, the expression `[str(x) for x in vprod]` will generate an empty list of strings. When this empty list is joined with spaces, it results in an empty string.

Therefore, the output will be an empty string.

Output: **''**
