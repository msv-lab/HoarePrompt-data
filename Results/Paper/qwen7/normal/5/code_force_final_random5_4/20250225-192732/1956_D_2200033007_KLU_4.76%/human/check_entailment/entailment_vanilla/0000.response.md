Reasoning:
1. The problem requires us to maximize the sum of the elements of the array `a` using at most \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.
2. Each operation involves setting all elements from index `l` to `r` to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of the subarray from `a[l]` to `a[r]`.
3. The provided code does not actually implement the logic to find the MEX value and update the array. Instead, it uses hardcoded values for different lengths of the array.
4. Let's analyze the examples given:
   - For `n = 2`, the initial array is `[0, 1]`. The code outputs `4 1` and the operation `1 2`, which correctly sets the array to `[2, 2]` to get a sum of `4`.
   - For `n = 3`, the initial array is `[1, 3, 9]`. The code outputs `13 0`, meaning no operations are needed since the sum is already maximized.
   - For `n = 4`, the initial array is `[1, 100, 2, 1]`. The code outputs `105 2` with operations `3 3` and `3 4`, which correctly sets the array to `[1, 100, 0, 0]` to get a sum of `101`, but the expected output is `105`, indicating the code is incomplete.
5. The code does not handle general cases where the array length is greater than 2, and it does not correctly compute the MEX value or perform the required operations.

Correctness: **False**
