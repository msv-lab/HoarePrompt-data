### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the annotated code step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Input Reading and List Initialization:**
   ```python
   a = []
   n = int(input())
   sa = input()
   na = sa.split()
   for ai in na:
       a.append(ai)
   ```
   This part correctly reads the input and initializes the list `a` with the given integers.

2. **Function Call:**
   ```python
   func_1(len(a))
   ```
   This calls the function `func_1` with the length of the list `a`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   ```python
   def func_1(c):
       m = 0
       if (c == 2) :
           print(f'4 1')
           print(f'1 2')
       else :
           print(f'13 0')
       return
   ```
   - The function `func_1` takes an integer `c` as input, which represents the length of the list `a`.
   - If `c` is 2, it prints "4 1" followed by "1 2".
   - If `c` is not 2, it prints "13 0".

Now, let's consider the examples provided in the problem statement and how the program behaves:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `2\n0 1`
  - Output: `4 1\n1 2`
  - Explanation: For `n = 2`, the function prints "4 1" and "1 2". This is correct because the maximum sum is 4 (achieved by setting both elements to 2), and one operation is needed.

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `3\n1 3 9`
  - Output: `13 0`
  - Explanation: For `n = 3`, the function prints "13 0". This is correct because the initial sum is already 13, and no operations are needed.

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `4\n1 100 2 1`
  - Output: `105 2\n3 3\n3 4`
  - Explanation: For `n = 4`, the function prints "105 2" and performs two operations. This is incorrect because the program does not perform any operations to achieve the maximum sum of 105. The correct operations would involve setting specific ranges to the MEX value.

- **Example 4:**
  - Input: `1\n0`
  - Output: `1 1\n1 1`
  - Explanation: For `n = 1`, the function prints "1 1". This is incorrect because the correct output should be "1 1" with no operations needed.

Based on the analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array elements. It hardcodes the output based on the length of the array without considering the actual values or performing the necessary operations. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
