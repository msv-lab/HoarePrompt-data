Output: **4 1**

Explanation: The initial state does not provide any specific values for the elements of the list `c` other than the fact that it equals 2. This means the list `c` is set to `[2]`. The variable `m` is explicitly stated to be 0. The `print` statement simply outputs the fixed string "4 1", which does not depend on the values of `c` or `m`. Therefore, the output is exactly "4 1".
