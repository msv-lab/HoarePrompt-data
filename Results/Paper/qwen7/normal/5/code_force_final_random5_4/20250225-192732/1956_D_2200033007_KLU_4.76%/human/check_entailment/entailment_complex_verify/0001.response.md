### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the annotated version to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize the sum of the array elements by performing operations that set a subarray to the MEX value of that subarray. The code should handle any array length \( n \) within the constraints.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the length of the array \( n \) and the array itself.
   - It then calls `func_1(len(a))`, passing the length of the array to the function.
   - `func_1` is a simple function that checks if the length of the array is 2. If it is, it prints "4 1" and "1 2". Otherwise, it prints "13 0".

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` does not actually compute the MEX value or perform any operations on the array. It simply prints hardcoded values based on the length of the array.
   - This means the function is not solving the problem as described.

4. **Examples Analysis**:
   - **Example 1**: For \( n = 2 \), the initial array is `[0, 1]`. The code outputs `4 1` and `1 2`, which correctly sets the array to `[2, 2]` to get a sum of `4`. This is correct.
   - **Example 2**: For \( n = 3 \), the initial array is `[1, 3, 9]`. The code outputs `13 0`, meaning no operations are needed since the sum is already maximized. This is correct.
   - **Example 3**: For \( n = 4 \), the initial array is `[1, 100, 2, 1]`. The code outputs `105 2` with operations `3 3` and `3 4`, which correctly sets the array to `[1, 100, 0, 0]` to get a sum of `101`. However, the expected output is `105`, indicating the code is incomplete. This is incorrect because the code does not handle the case where the array length is greater than 2 properly.

5. **General Case**:
   - The code does not handle the general case where the array length is greater than 2. It only handles arrays of length 2 and 3, and even for these cases, it does not compute the MEX value or perform the required operations.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The code does not implement the logic to find the MEX value and update the array. It only prints hardcoded values based on the length of the array, which is not a solution to the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. It only handles specific cases and does not compute the MEX value or perform the required operations to maximize the sum of the array elements.
