Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and compare it against the problem description and the function summary.

1. **Problem Description Analysis**:
   - The program needs to read an array of integers.
   - It must perform operations to maximize the sum of the elements in the array.
   - The operations involve setting a subarray to the MEX (minimum excluded value) of that subarray.
   - The program should output the maximum possible sum and the sequence of operations used to achieve this sum.

2. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `c`.
   - If the length of `c` is 2, it prints "4 1" followed by "1 2".
   - If the length of `c` is not 2, it prints "13 0".

3. **Program Code Analysis**:
   - The program reads the length of the array `n` and then reads the array `a`.
   - It calls `func_1(len(a))`, passing the length of the array to the function.
   - The function `func_1` does not use the actual array `a` but instead hardcodes the output based on the length of the array.

Given these points, let's evaluate the program:

- The program does not read the actual array values; it only uses the length of the array.
- The function `func_1` does not perform any operations to maximize the sum of the array elements.
- The hardcoded outputs do not depend on the actual values in the array, which means the program cannot achieve the correct maximum sum for different arrays.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
The program will output:
```
13 0
```
This is incorrect because the maximum sum achievable is 105, not 13. The program does not provide any operations to achieve this sum.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is thus incorrect.

Final: **False**
