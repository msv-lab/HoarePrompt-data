### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided code does not implement the logic to find the MEX value and update the array as required by the problem statement. However, the assessment seems to overlook the fact that the provided code is indeed solving specific cases correctly, albeit in a hardcoded manner.

Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize the sum of the array elements by performing operations that set a subarray to the MEX value of that subarray. The operations are limited to \(5 \times 10^5\).

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the input size `n` and the array `a`.
   - It then calls `func_1(len(a))`, passing the length of the array to the function.
   - `func_1` is a hardcoded function that prints specific results based on the length of the array:
     - If `n == 2`, it prints `4 1` and performs the operation `1 2`.
     - Otherwise, it prints `13 0`.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - **Example 1 (`n = 2`)**: Initial array `[0, 1]`. The code correctly sets the array to `[2, 2]` to get a sum of `4`.
   - **Example 2 (`n = 3`)**: Initial array `[1, 3, 9]`. The code correctly prints `13 0`, indicating no operations are needed since the sum is already maximized.
   - **Example 3 (`n = 4`)**: Initial array `[1, 100, 2, 1]`. The code prints `105 2` with operations `3 3` and `3 4`, which correctly sets the array to `[1, 100, 0, 0]` to get a sum of `101`. However, the expected output is `105`, indicating the code is incomplete.

4. **General Case Handling**:
   - The code does not handle general cases where the array length is greater than 2. It only provides hardcoded solutions for specific lengths.
   - For general cases, the code would need to compute the MEX value and update the array accordingly, which is not implemented in the provided code.

5. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the code does not handle general cases and does not compute the MEX value or perform the required operations.
   - However, the assessment fails to recognize that the provided code correctly handles the specific cases given in the examples.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not fully solve the problem as stated, but it does correctly handle the specific examples given. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in identifying the limitations of the code but is overly critical in terms of completeness.

**Final: False**

The code is not complete and does not handle general cases, but it correctly solves the specific examples provided.
