Based on the initial state provided:

- `success` is `False`.
- `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `position`, `health`, `distance`, `time_available`, and `bullets_needed` are undefined (their values are not specified).

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('YES' if success else 'NO')
```

Since `success` is explicitly stated to be `False`, the condition `if success` will evaluate to `False`.

Therefore, the `else` part of the conditional expression will be executed, printing `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
