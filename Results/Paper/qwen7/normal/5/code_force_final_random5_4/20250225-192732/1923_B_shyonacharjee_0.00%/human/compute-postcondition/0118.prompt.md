Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^4, and t is now set to the integer value entered by the user.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    healths = list(map(int, input().split()))
    positions = list(map(int, input().split()))
    monsters = sorted(zip(positions, healths), key=lambda x: abs(x[0]))
    total_bullets_used = 0
    success = True
    for i in range(n):
        position, health = monsters[i]
        distance = abs(position)
        time_available = distance
        bullets_needed = health
        if total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available:
            success = False
            break
        total_bullets_used += bullets_needed
    print('YES' if success else 'NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: success is False, monsters remains a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, n is an input integer, i is n, position is undefined, health is undefined, distance is undefined, time_available is undefined, bullets_needed is undefined, total_bullets_used is the sum of all bullets_needed for all monsters.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `success` is False, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `position` is now the first element of the tuple at index `i + 2` in `monsters`, `health` is now the second element of the tuple at index `i + 2` in `monsters`, `distance` is now `abs(position)` of the tuple at index `i + 2` in `monsters`, `time_available` is now equal to `distance` of the tuple at index `i + 2` in `monsters`, `bullets_needed` is `health` of the tuple at index `i + 2` in `monsters`, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of `health` for all tuples in `monsters`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the loop condition `i < n` will no longer be satisfied since `i` will be incremented up to `n-1`. The variable `success` remains `False` because it was set to `False` during the first iteration and never changed afterward. The `monsters` list remains unchanged as no modifications were made to it within the loop. The `position` and `health` variables are updated to the last monster in the list (`monsters[n-1]`). The `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the last monster, `time_available` is equal to this distance, and `bullets_needed` is the health of the last monster. The `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the `health` values of all monsters, as each monster's `health` was added to `total_bullets_used` in each iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `total_bullets_used` is the sum of `bullets_needed` for all iterations, `success` is False, `monsters` remains a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `i` is `n`, `position` is undefined (since the loop has completed and `i` is no longer within the bounds of `monsters`), `health` is undefined, `distance` is undefined, `time_available` is undefined, and `bullets_needed` is undefined.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, meaning all elements in the `monsters` list have been processed. The `success` variable remains False because the condition `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available` caused `success` to be set to False during one of the iterations. All other variables that were updated inside the loop are no longer relevant since the loop has ended, and thus they are undefined.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
