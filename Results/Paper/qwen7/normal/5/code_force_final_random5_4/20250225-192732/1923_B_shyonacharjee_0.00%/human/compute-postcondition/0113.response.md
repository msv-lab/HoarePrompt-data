Postcondition: **`total_bullets_used` is increased by `bullets_needed`, `success` is False, `monsters` remains a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `i` is `i + 1`, and either we break out of the most internal loop or if statement because `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available`, or there is no else part and the program continues as normal.**
