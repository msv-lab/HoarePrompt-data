Output State: **`total_bullets_used` is 0, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `n` is an input integer, `i` must be between 0 and n-1 inclusive, `success` is True, `position` is the position of the i-th monster in the `monsters` list, `health` is the health of the i-th monster in the `monsters` list, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the i-th monster in the `monsters` list.**

The code calculates the distance from the player to the i-th monster by taking the absolute value of the monster's position. This value is stored in the variable `distance`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
