Output State: **`success` remains False, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `position` is now the first element of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `monsters`, `health` is now the second element of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `monsters`, `distance` is now `abs(position)` of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `monsters`, `time_available` is now equal to `distance` of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `monsters`, `bullets_needed` is `health` of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `monsters`, `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used + health`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or if statement that was being executed. The values of the variables remain unchanged except for the fact that the loop or conditional block is exited.
