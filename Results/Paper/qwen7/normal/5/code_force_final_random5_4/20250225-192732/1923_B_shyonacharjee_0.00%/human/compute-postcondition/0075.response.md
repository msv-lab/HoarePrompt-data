Output State: **`success` remains False, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `position` is now the first element of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `monsters`, `health` is now the second element of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `monsters`, `distance` is now `abs(position)` of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `monsters`, `time_available` is now equal to `distance` of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `monsters`, `bullets_needed` is `health` of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `monsters`, `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used + health + bullets_needed`.**

Explanation: The line `total_bullets_used += bullets_needed` adds the value of `bullets_needed` to `total_bullets_used`. Since `bullets_needed` is equal to `health` of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `monsters`, `total_bullets_used` is updated to `total_bullets_used + health + bullets_needed`. All other variables remain unchanged.
