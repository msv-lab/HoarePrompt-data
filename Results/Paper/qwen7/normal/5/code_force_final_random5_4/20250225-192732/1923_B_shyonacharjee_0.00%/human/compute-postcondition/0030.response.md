Output State: **`success` is False, `monsters` remains a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `i` is `i + 2`, `position` is the first element of the `(i + 2)`-th tuple in `monsters`, `health` is the second element of the `(i + 2)`-th tuple in `monsters`, `distance` is calculated as `abs(position)`, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `bullets_needed` is the health of the `(i + 2)`-th monster, and `total_bullets_used` is increased by `bullets_needed`.**

This means that the distance to the monster at the `(i + 2)`-th position in the `monsters` list has been calculated as the absolute value of its position. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
