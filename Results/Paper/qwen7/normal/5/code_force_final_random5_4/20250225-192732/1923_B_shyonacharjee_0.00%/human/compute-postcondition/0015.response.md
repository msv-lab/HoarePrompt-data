Output State: **`success` is False, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `n` is an input integer, `i` must be between 0 and n-1 inclusive, `position` is the position of the i-th monster in the `monsters` list, `health` is the health of the i-th monster in the `monsters` list, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the i-th monster in the `monsters` list, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `bullets_needed` is the health of the i-th monster, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or block of code it is within. In this case, since there is no explicit loop or conditional block indicated, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables listed. It only indicates that the program would exit the current loop or block of code. All the variables retain their initial states as described.
