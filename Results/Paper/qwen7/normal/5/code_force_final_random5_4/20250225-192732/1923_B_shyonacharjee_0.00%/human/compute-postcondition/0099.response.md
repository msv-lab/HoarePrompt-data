Output State: **`total_bullets_used` is increased by `bullets_needed`, `success` is False, `monsters` remains a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `i` is `i + 1`, `position` is the first element of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `monsters`, `health` is the second element of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `monsters`, `distance` is `abs(position)`, `time_available` remains equal to `distance`, and `bullets_needed` remains `health`.**

This means that the `distance` has been updated to the absolute value of the current `position`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
