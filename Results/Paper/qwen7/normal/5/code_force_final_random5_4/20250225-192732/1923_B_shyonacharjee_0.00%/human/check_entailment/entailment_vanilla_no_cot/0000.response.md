Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if the player can survive and kill all monsters without any of them reaching the player's position. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting Monsters**: It sorts the monsters based on their absolute positions from the player (0), which ensures that the closest monsters are addressed first.
3. **Calculating Bullets Needed**: For each monster, it calculates the number of bullets needed to kill the monster (`bullets_needed`) and the time available to use those bullets (`time_available`), which is the distance to the monster.
4. **Checking Feasibility**: It checks if the total bullets used so far plus the bullets needed for the current monster exceed the time available. If they do, it sets `success` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
5. **Outputting Result**: After processing all monsters, it prints `'YES'` if the player can survive and kill all monsters, otherwise `'NO'`.

This approach ensures that the player always targets the closest monsters first, which is the optimal strategy given the constraints. The program handles all edge cases and follows the problem description accurately.
