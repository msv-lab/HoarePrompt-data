Output State: **`success` is False, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `position` is now the first element of the tuple at index `i + 3` in `monsters`, `health` is now the second element of the tuple at index `i + 3` in `monsters`, `distance` is now `abs(position)` of the tuple at index `i + 3` in `monsters`, `time_available` is now equal to `distance` of the tuple at index `i + 3` in `monsters`, `bullets_needed` is `health` of the tuple at index `i + 3` in `monsters`, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of `health` for all tuples in `monsters`, `healths` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces, `positions` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code sorts the `monsters` list by the absolute value of the positions using the `sorted` function and a lambda function as the key. This changes the order of the elements in the `monsters` list, but does not affect the values of the other variables. The other variables remain unchanged and retain their previous values as described in the initial state.
