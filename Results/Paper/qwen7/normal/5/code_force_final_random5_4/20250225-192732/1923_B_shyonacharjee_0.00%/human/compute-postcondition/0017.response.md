Output State: **`success` is False, `monsters` remains a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `n` is an input integer, `i` must be between 0 and n-1 inclusive, `position` is the position of the i-th monster in the `monsters` list, `health` is the health of the i-th monster in the `monsters` list, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the i-th monster in the `monsters` list, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `bullets_needed` is the health of the i-th monster, `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used` + `bullets_needed`.**

Explanation: The line `total_bullets_used += bullets_needed` increments the value of `total_bullets_used` by the value of `bullets_needed`, which is the health of the i-th monster. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
