Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `success` is True, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `i` is `n`, `position` is now a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `health` is a list of integers converted from the input, `distance`, `time_available`, and `bullets_needed` are undefined, `total_bullets_used` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    position, health = monsters[i]
    distance = abs(position)
    time_available = distance
    bullets_needed = health
    if total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available:
        success = False
        break
    total_bullets_used += bullets_needed


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `success` is False, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `i` is less than `n`, `position` is now a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `health` is a list of integers converted from the input, `distance` is the absolute value of the position from the tuple in the `monsters` list at index `i`, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `bullets_needed` is `health`, and `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `success` remains False, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `position` is now the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `monsters`, `health` is now the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `monsters`, `distance` is now `abs(position)`, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `bullets_needed` is `health`, `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used + health`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `success` remains False, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `i` is less than `n - 1`, `position` is now the first element of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `monsters`, `health` is now the second element of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `monsters`, `distance` is now `abs(position)` of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `monsters`, `time_available` is now equal to `distance` of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `monsters`, `bullets_needed` is `health` of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `monsters`, `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used + health + bullets_needed`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
