Output State: **`total_bullets_used` is 0, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 3 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `healths` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `positions` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The line `total_bullets_used = 0` initializes the variable `total_bullets_used` to 0. This is the only variable that gets updated, and all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
