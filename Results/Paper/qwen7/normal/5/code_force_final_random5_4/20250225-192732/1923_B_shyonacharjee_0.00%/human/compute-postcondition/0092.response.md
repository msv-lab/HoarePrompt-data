Postcondition: **`total_bullets_used` is 0, `success` is True, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `i` is less than `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `position` is now the first element of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `monsters`, `health` is now the second element of the tuple at index `i + 1` in `monsters`, `distance` is now `abs(position)`, `time_available` is now equal to `distance`, `bullets_needed` is `health`, and the total bullets used plus the bullets needed is greater than the time available**.
