Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 3 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and splits them by whitespace, converting each to an integer. It then assigns these integers to the variables `n` and `k`. The value of `t` remains unchanged and is still a positive integer within the specified range.
