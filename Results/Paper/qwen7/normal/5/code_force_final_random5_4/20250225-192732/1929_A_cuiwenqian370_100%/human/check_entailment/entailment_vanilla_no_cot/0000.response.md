Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements. The current approach in `func_1` calculates the absolute difference between consecutive elements after sorting the array, which does not necessarily maximize the beauty.

To maximize the beauty, we should arrange the array such that the largest values are paired with the smallest values to maximize positive differences and minimize negative differences. Here's a corrected approach:

1. Sort the array.
2. Pair the smallest element with the largest element, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on.
3. Calculate the beauty based on these pairs.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(len(array) // 2):
        beauty += array[-(i + 1)] - array[i]
    if len(array) % 2 == 1:
        beauty += array[len(array) // 2]
    return beauty

def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(array)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Test the function with provided examples
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func_2()
```

This approach ensures that the array is rearranged to maximize the beauty as required by the problem statement.
