Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

# Annotated Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers where 2 <= len(array) <= 100 and 1 <= array[i] <= 10^9 for all valid i.
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
        
    #State: Output State: `beauty` is 15, `i` is 4, `len(array)` is greater than 4.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to add the absolute difference between consecutive elements in the array to the `beauty` variable. Given that the `beauty` value increases by the sum of differences between consecutive elements with each iteration, and knowing the pattern from the provided outputs (1, 3, 6), we can deduce that the differences are cumulative. If the `beauty` value is 6 after 3 iterations, it suggests the differences between the first 4 elements of the array are such that their cumulative absolute differences sum up to 6. For the next iteration, the `i` value increments to 4, and assuming the array has more than 4 elements, the next difference will be added to `beauty`. Without loss of generality, if the differences continue to follow a pattern or the array is such that the next difference adds 9 (as a plausible next step based on the increasing pattern), then the `beauty` value would be 15 after 4 iterations. Therefore, after all iterations, `beauty` would be 15, `i` would be 4, and the array must have more than 4 elements.
    return beauty
    #The program returns 15, `i` is 4, and `len(array)` is greater than 4.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 100 representing the length of the array; array is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9]; results is a list to store the maximum beauty for each test case.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(array)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will have executed `t` times. After all iterations, `index` will be increased by `1 + t*n`, where `t` is the initial value of `data[0]` converted to an integer, and `n` is the sum of `n` values specified in `data` for each iteration. `results` will be a list containing the return values of `func_1(array)` for each iteration. The final state of `t` will be 0, as it is decremented by 1 after each iteration until it reaches 0. `array` will be updated in each iteration based on the current value of `n` and the slice of `data` starting from `index` and having length `n`. `n` itself will be updated at the start of each iteration to the integer value of `data[index]`, and `index` will be incremented accordingly after each iteration.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `index` will point to the position right after the last processed data, `t` will be 0, `results` will contain the outputs of `func_1(array)` for each iteration, and `array` will be updated in each iteration based on the current value of `n` and the corresponding slice of `data`.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` will be 0, `results` will be a list containing the outputs of `func_1(array)` for each iteration, `index` will point to the position right after the last processed data, `array` will be updated in each iteration based on the current value of `n` and the corresponding slice of `data`, and `data` must be a list containing integers. The final state of `t` will be 0, as it is decremented by 1 after each iteration until it reaches 0. `results` will contain the outputs of `func_1(array)` for each iteration, and `array` will be updated in each iteration based on the current value of `n` and the corresponding slice of `data`. `index` will be increased by `1 + t*n` after all iterations, where `t` is the initial value of `data[0]` converted to an integer, and `n` is the sum of `n` values specified in `data` for each iteration.
