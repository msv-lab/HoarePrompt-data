Output State: **`data[0]` must be a positive integer; `index` is increased by `4 + n`; `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`, `results` is a list to which `result` has been appended; `t` is decreased by 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[index - n]`; `array` is now updated to `list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))`; `results` is a list with an additional element `result`.**

Explanation:
- The code appends the current `result` to the list `results`.
- All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
