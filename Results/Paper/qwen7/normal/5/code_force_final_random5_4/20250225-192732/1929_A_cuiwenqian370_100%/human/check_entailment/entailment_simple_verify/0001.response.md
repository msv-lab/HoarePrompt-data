### Reasoning

Let's analyze the problem and the given code step by step to determine if the solution is correct.

#### Problem Analysis
The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

#### Given Code Explanation
1. **func_1(array):**
   - This function sorts the array.
   - It calculates the beauty of the array using the sorted order.
   - The beauty is calculated as the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements.

2. **func_2():**
   - This function reads input from stdin.
   - It processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` with the array and appends the result to a list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

#### Reasoning
1. **Sorting the Array:**
   - Sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are minimized when the array is in ascending or descending order.
   - For a sorted array \([a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]\), the beauty is \(\sum_{i=2}^{n} |a_i - a_{i-1}|\).
   - In the worst case, this would be \((a_n - a_1)\) if the array is sorted in ascending or descending order.

2. **Maximizing Beauty:**
   - To maximize the beauty, we should consider the differences between the smallest and largest elements.
   - By sorting the array, we ensure that the largest difference is between the smallest and largest elements, which maximizes the beauty.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The `func_2` function correctly handles multiple test cases by reading input and processing each one separately.
   - It uses `func_1` to calculate the beauty for each test case and prints the results.

However, upon closer inspection of the annotated code and the provided examples, there is a critical flaw in the original assessment. The original assessment assumes that the beauty is maximized by sorting the array, but this is not always the case. The correct approach is to maximize the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, which can be achieved by sorting the array and then reversing it.

#### Correct Approach
To maximize the beauty, we should sort the array and then reverse it. This ensures that the largest differences are between the smallest and largest elements, and the intermediate differences are minimized.

Here is the corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    array.reverse()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
    return beauty
```

With this correction, the program will correctly maximize the beauty of the array.

### Conclusion
The original assessment was inaccurate because it did not account for the need to reverse the sorted array to maximize the beauty. The correct approach involves sorting the array and then reversing it.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
