Output State: **`data[0]` must be a positive integer; `index` is increased by `4 + n`; `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`, `results` is a list to which `result` has been appended; `t` is decreased by 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[index - n]`; `array` is now updated to `list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))`**

Explanation: The code `result = func_1(array)` updates the value of `result` to be the return value of `func_1(array)`. It does not affect the other variables' states. Therefore, the output state remains as described in the initial state, with `result` being the return value of `func_1(array)`.
