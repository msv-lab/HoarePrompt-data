Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be a positive integer.
- `results` must be a non-empty list.
- `index` must be initialized to 0 or a valid starting index.
- `array` must be defined and initialized.
- `data` must be a list containing integers.

The print statement is `print(result)`. However, the variable `result` is not explicitly defined or given any value in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `result` from the given information.

Given this, the output will be a placeholder for the value of `result`.

Output: **result (where result is an undefined value)**
