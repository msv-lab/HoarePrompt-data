Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t)`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `data[0]` must be a positive integer.
   - `index` is increased by `4 + n`.
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`.
   - `results` is a list to which `result` has been appended.
   - `t` is decreased by 1.
   - `n` is the integer value of `data[index - n]`.
   - `array` is now updated to `list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))`.
   - `results` is a list with an additional element `result`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop depends on `t`, we need to decrease `t` by 1 from its current value.
   - All other variables (`data[0]`, `index`, `result`, `results`, `n`, and `array`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

5. **New state for the next iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (since it was decreased by 1 from its previous value).

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`data[0]` must be a positive integer; `index` is increased by `4 + n`; `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`, `results` is a list to which `result` has been appended; `t` is decreased by 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[index - n]`; `array` is now updated to `list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))`; `results` is a list with an additional element `result`; `t` must be greater than 0**
