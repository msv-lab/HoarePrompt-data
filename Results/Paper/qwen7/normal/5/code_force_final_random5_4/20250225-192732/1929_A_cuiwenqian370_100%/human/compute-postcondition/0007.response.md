Output State: **`data[0]` must be a positive integer; `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `index` is increased by 1.**

The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. The initial state of `data[0]` being a positive integer and `n` being the integer value of `data[index]` remains unchanged except for the increment of `index`.
