Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The loop will have executed `t` times. After all iterations, `index` will be increased by `1 + t*n`, where `t` is the initial value of `data[0]` converted to an integer, and `n` is the sum of `n` values specified in `data` for each iteration. `results` will be a list containing the return values of `func_1(array)` for each iteration. The final state of `t` will be 0, as it is decremented by 1 after each iteration until it reaches 0. `array` will be updated in each iteration based on the current value of `n` and the slice of `data` starting from `index` and having length `n`. `n` itself will be updated at the start of each iteration to the integer value of `data[index]`, and `index` will be incremented accordingly after each iteration.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `index` will point to the position right after the last processed data, `t` will be 0, `results` will contain the outputs of `func_1(array)` for each iteration, and `array` will be updated in each iteration based on the current value of `n` and the corresponding slice of `data`.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be a positive integer, `results` must be a non-empty list, `index` must be initialized to 0 or a valid starting index, `array` must be defined and initialized, `data` must be a list containing integers

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be a positive integer, `results` must be a non-empty list, `index` must be initialized to 0 or a valid starting index, `array` must be defined and initialized, `data` must be a list containing integers

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` must be a positive integer, `results` must be a non-empty list, `index` must be initialized to 0 or a valid starting index, `array` must be defined and initialized, `data` must be a list containing integers




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
