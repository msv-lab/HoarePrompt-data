### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code step-by-step.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to find the maximum possible beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The beauty is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(array)`**:
   - This function sorts the array and then computes the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - Sorting the array ensures that the differences are minimized, which might not always yield the maximum beauty.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It reads the number of test cases, the size of each array, and the array elements, then computes and prints the beauty for each test case.

#### Annotations Analysis:
- The annotations suggest that the function `func_1` returns a value of 15 with `i` set to 4 and the length of the array greater than 4. This is misleading because the annotations do not reflect the actual behavior of the function for different inputs.
- The function `func_2` processes multiple test cases and prints the results, but the annotations do not provide enough information to validate the correctness of the output for all cases.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- The original assessment correctly points out that sorting the array does not necessarily maximize the beauty. The example provided shows that sorting does not yield the maximum beauty for the array `[1, 2, 3]`.
- To maximize the beauty, we need to strategically place the largest and smallest elements to maximize the differences.

#### Example Verification:
- Consider the array `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`:
  - Sorting gives `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`, and the beauty is \((54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57\).
  - The correct rearrangement to maximize the beauty could be `[100, 43, 90, 54, 80]`, and the beauty is \((43-100) + (90-43) + (54-90) + (80-54) = -57 + 47 - 36 + 26 = 57\).

- Consider the array `[2, 1, 3]`:
  - Sorting gives `[1, 2, 3]`, and the beauty is \((2-1) + (3-2) = 1 + 1 = 2\).
  - The correct rearrangement to maximize the beauty could be `[3, 1, 2]`, and the beauty is \((3-1) + (1-2) = 2 - 1 - 1 = 0\).

Given these examples, the function `func_1` does not always yield the maximum beauty.

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases due to the sorting approach used in `func_1`.

**Final: False**
