Output State: **`input` is set to `sys.stdin.read`, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `array` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9], `results` is a list to store the maximum beauty for each test case, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string.**

The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input using `sys.stdin.read`, splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `data`. The values of `t`, `n`, `array`, and `results` remain unchanged from their initial state.
