Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head in this case is the `for result in results:` statement. However, since the loop body is omitted, we need to consider the variables that are used to control the loop and those that are modified within the loop.

2. **Variables Modified or Controlled by the Loop:**
   - `result`: This variable is used to iterate over the `results` list.
   - `results`: This list contains the return values of `func_1(array)` for each iteration.
   - `index`: This variable is updated at the end of each iteration.
   - `t`: This variable is initialized and decremented by 1 after each iteration until it reaches 0.
   - `array`: This array is updated in each iteration based on the current value of `n` and the slice of `data` starting from `index` and having length `n`.
   - `n`: This variable is updated at the start of each iteration to the integer value of `data[index]`.

3. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `t` must be a positive integer because it is decremented until it reaches 0.
   - `results` must be a non-empty list to ensure the loop can execute.
   - `index` must be initialized to 0 or a valid starting index.
   - `array` must be defined and initialized before the loop starts.
   - `data` must be a list containing integers to ensure `n` can be correctly extracted.

4. **Final States:**
   - `t` will be 0 after all iterations.
   - `index` will point to the position right after the last processed data.
   - `results` will contain the outputs of `func_1(array)` for each iteration.
   - `array` will be updated in each iteration based on the current value of `n` and the corresponding slice of `data`.

### Adjusted States:

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `t` must be a positive integer (since it is decremented until it reaches 0).
- `results` must be a non-empty list.
- `index` must be initialized to 0 or a valid starting index.
- `array` must be defined and initialized.
- `data` must be a list containing integers.

### Final Answer:

State: **`t` must be a positive integer, `results` must be a non-empty list, `index` must be initialized to 0 or a valid starting index, `array` must be defined and initialized, `data` must be a list containing integers**.
