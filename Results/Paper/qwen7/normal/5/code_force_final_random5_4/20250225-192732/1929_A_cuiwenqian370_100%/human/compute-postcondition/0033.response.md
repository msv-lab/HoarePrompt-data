The only objects in the loop head are `result` and `results`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in the `results` list.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states were true:
- `t` must be a positive integer
- `results` must be a non-empty list
- `index` must be initialized to 0 or a valid starting index
- `array` must be defined and initialized
- `data` must be a list containing integers

For the loop to execute one more time, the `results` list must still contain at least one element. Therefore, we need to ensure that `results` is still a non-empty list.

State: **`t` must be a positive integer, `results` must be a non-empty list, `index` must be initialized to 0 or a valid starting index, `array` must be defined and initialized, `data` must be a list containing integers**
