Output State: **`index` is 1, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `array` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9], `results` is now an empty list, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string.**

The code initializes the `results` list to an empty list, while keeping all other variables unchanged. Therefore, the values of `index`, `t`, `n`, `array`, and `data` remain the same as their initial states.
