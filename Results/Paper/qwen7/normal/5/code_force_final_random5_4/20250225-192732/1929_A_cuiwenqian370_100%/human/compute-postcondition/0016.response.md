Output State: **`data[0]` must be a positive integer; `index` is increased by `4 + n`; `array` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index - n:index]`; `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`, `results` is a list to which `result` has been appended; `t` is decreased by 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[index - n]`; `array` is now updated to `list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))`**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `index` is increased by `2 + n`.
- After executing `index += n`, `index` is further increased by `n`, making the total increase `2 + n + n = 4 + n`.
- All other variables (`data[0]`, `array`, `result`, `results`, `t`, and `n`) remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
