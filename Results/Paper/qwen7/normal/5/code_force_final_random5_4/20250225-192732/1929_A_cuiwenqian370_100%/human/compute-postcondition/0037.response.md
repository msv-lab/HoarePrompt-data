The function `func_2` accepts no explicit parameters but operates on a set of predefined variables: `t` (a positive integer representing the number of test cases), `n` (a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 100 representing the length of the array), `array` (a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9]), and `results` (a list to store the maximum beauty for each test case). The function calculates and stores the maximum beauty for each test case in the `results` list.

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes `t` test cases, each involving an array of `n` integers. It calculates the maximum beauty for each test case and stores these values in the `results` list.**
