Output State: **`data[0]` must be a positive integer; `index` is increased by `1 + n`; `array` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index - n:index]`; `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`, `results` is a list to which `result` has been appended; `t` is decreased by 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the integer value of `data[index]` to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` to the integer value of `data[index]`. All other variables remain in their previous states, including the condition that `data[0]` must be a positive integer, `index` is increased by `1 + n`, `array` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index - n:index]`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`, `results` is a list to which `result` has been appended, and `t` is decreased by 1.
