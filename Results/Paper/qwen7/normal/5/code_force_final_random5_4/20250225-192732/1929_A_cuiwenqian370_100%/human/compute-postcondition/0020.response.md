Output State: **`data[0]` must be a positive integer; `index` is increased by `4 + n`; `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`, `results` is a list to which `result` has been appended; `t` is decreased by 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[index - n]`; `array` is now updated to `list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))`; `results` is a list with an additional element `result`; `t` must be greater than 0; `n` is the integer value of `data[index - n]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `n` to the integer value of `data[index - n]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `n` is specifically derived from the value at `data[index - n]`.
