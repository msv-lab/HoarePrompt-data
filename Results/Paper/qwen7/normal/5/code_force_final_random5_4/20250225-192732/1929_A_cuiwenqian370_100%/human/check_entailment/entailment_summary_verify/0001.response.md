### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the given code aims to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting it and then calculating the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. However, let's re-evaluate the logic to ensure it aligns perfectly with the problem statement.

1. **Problem Statement Recap:**
   - The beauty of the array is defined as \(\sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1})\).
   - To maximize this, we need to maximize the differences between consecutive elements.

2. **Given Code Analysis:**
   - **func_1(array):**
     - Sorts the array.
     - Calculates the beauty using the sorted order.
     - This approach assumes that the maximum beauty is achieved by arranging the array in either ascending or descending order.
   - **func_2():**
     - Reads input from stdin.
     - Processes multiple test cases.
     - Calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the results.

3. **Detailed Evaluation:**
   - **Sorting the Array:**
     - Sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are minimized when the array is in ascending or descending order.
     - For a sorted array \([a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]\), the beauty is \(\sum_{i=2}^{n} |a_i - a_{i-1}|\).
     - In the worst case, this would be \((a_n - a_1)\) if the array is sorted in ascending or descending order.
   - **Maximizing Beauty:**
     - The approach in `func_1` is correct because sorting the array ensures that the largest possible differences are used to maximize the beauty.
   - **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
     - The `func_2` function correctly handles multiple test cases by reading input and processing each one separately.
     - It uses `func_1` to calculate the beauty for each test case and prints the results.

4. **Verification Using Function Summaries:**
   - The function summary confirms that `func_2` processes each test case and calls `func_1` to calculate the beauty.
   - The final state of the program includes `t` being 0, `results` containing the calculated maximum beauties for each test case, and `index` pointing to the position right after the last processed data.

### Conclusion
The given code correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting it and calculating the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. The approach is sound and should work for all valid inputs as per the problem description.

### Final Answer
Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate.
