Output State: **Postcondition: `n` must be at least 2, `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n - 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `n`, `i`, `p1`, or `p2`. It only indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Therefore, the postconditions remain unchanged, and we simply note that the execution breaks out of the loop or conditional block.
