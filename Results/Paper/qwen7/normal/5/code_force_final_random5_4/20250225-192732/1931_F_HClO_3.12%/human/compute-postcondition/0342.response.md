Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `0` to `n-1`. This means that at the start of each iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `idx1` and `idx2` are integers.
   - `p1` and `p2` are integers.
   - If `l1[i + p1]` does not equal `l2[i + p2]`, then `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is 0, and `p2` is 1, and we break out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is 0, `p1` is 0, and `p2` is 0, and we break out of the loop.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at the start of each iteration, `i` will be increased by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the range and does not change within the loop.

5. **Consider the postconditions**:
   - If the condition `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]` was met in the previous iteration, then `idx1` would be -1, `idx2` would be `i`, `p1` would be 0, and `p2` would be 1.
   - If the condition was not met, then `idx1` would be 0, `idx2` would be 0, `p1` would be 0, and `p2` would be 0.

Since the loop will continue to run as long as `i < n-1`, we assume that the condition `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]` did not hold true in the previous iteration (otherwise, the loop would have broken). Therefore, the values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` remain 0, 0, 0, and 0 respectively.

6. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` remain 0, 0, 0, and 0 respectively.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`idx1` is 0, `idx2` is 0, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is `n`**.
