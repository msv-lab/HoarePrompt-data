Postcondition: `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2` are integers, and `val` is a list containing at least `m-1` tuples, each tuple is of the form `(a3, l3)`. If `l3` is not equal to the list `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l3` is equal to `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, the same conditions hold but no action is taken within the if-else block.
