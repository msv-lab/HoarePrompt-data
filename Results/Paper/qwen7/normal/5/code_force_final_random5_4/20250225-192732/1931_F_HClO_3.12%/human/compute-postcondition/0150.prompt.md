Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The variable `val` is a list containing as many tuples as the value of `m` minus 2. Each tuple in the list is of the form `(a3, l3)`, where `a3` is an integer input from the user and `l3` is a list of integers obtained from the remaining inputs. The variables `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` remain in their initial states (either -1 or 0 for `idx1` and `idx2`, and either 0 or 1 for `p1` and `p2`). The variable `m` remains unchanged and must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute at least 3 times.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the list `val` will contain as many tuples as `m - 2`, with each tuple consisting of an integer `a3` and a list `l3` of integers. The other variables (`idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`) will retain their initial values, and `m` will still need to be greater than 2 for the loop to run at least 3 times.
Code of the loop:
for a3, l3 in val:
    if l3 != [i for i in l if i != a3]:
        print('no')
        break
else:
    print('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `val` is a list containing at least 3 tuples, each of the form (a3, l3), `m` is greater than 2, `idx1` is either -1 or 0, `idx2` is either -1 or 0, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1. If the current value of `l3` is not equal to a list comprehension of all elements in `l` excluding elements equal to `a3`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `val` is a list containing at least 3 tuples, each of the form (a3, l3), `m` is greater than 2, `idx1` is either -1 or 0, `idx2` is either -1 or 0, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `l3` is not equal to a list of elements in `l` that are not equal to `a3`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `val` is a list containing at least 2 tuples, each of the form (a3_next, l3_next), `m` is greater than 2, `idx1` is either -1 or 0, `idx2` is either -1 or 0, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, and if `l3` is not a list excluding all elements equal to `a3`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
