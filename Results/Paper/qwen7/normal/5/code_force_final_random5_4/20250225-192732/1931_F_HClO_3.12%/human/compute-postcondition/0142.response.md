Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `a3` and `l3` from the tuple `(a3, l3)`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `val` contains tuples.
   - Each tuple in `val` is of the form `(a3, l3)`.
   - There is no explicit condition given in the loop head that directly controls the continuation of the loop. However, the loop will continue as long as there are more tuples in `val`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `val` is a list containing at least 3 tuples, each of the form `(a3, l3)`.
   - `m` is greater than 2.
   - `idx1` is either -1 or 0.
   - `idx2` is either -1 or 0.
   - `p1` is either 0 or 1.
   - `p2` is either 0 or 1.
   - The loop does not break based on the values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, or `p2` alone; it breaks based on the content of `l3` compared to a list comprehension.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as there are more tuples in `val`, we need to ensure that `val` still contains tuples.
   - The values of `m`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` do not affect the continuation of the loop, so they remain unchanged.
   - We need to ensure that `val` still contains at least one tuple, meaning `val` should not be empty.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`val` is a list containing at least 3 tuples, each of the form (a3, l3), `m` is greater than 2, `idx1` is either -1 or 0, `idx2` is either -1 or 0, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1**.
