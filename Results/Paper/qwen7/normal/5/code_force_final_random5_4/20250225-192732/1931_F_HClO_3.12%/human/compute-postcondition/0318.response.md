Output State: **`idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `i`. It only indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. The condition that `i + max(p1, p2)` is equal to `n - 1` remains valid as no changes were made to `i`, `p1`, or `p2`.
