Postcondition: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n - 1` or `n - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`, then `idx1` is equal to `i`. Otherwise, `idx2` is equal to `i`, and the condition `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]` is true, and either `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` or `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`. Additionally, if `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`, then `p2` is 1, and `idx1` and `idx2` are both greater than or equal to 0.**
