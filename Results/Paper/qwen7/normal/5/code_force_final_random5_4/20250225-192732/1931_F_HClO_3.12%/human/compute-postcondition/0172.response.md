Output State: **`idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `t` is 0, `a1` is the first integer from input, `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `a2` is the second integer from input, `l22` is a list of elements from `l2` excluding `a1`.**

Explanation: The code sets `idx1` and `idx2` to -1. The values of `p1`, `p2`, `t`, `a1`, `l11`, `a2`, `l22`, `n`, `m`, and the condition for the loop (whether `l11` is equal to `l22`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects these unaltered values and conditions.
