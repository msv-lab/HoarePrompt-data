Output State: **`idx1` is -1, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 1, `i` is `i`, and `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`**

The code `p2 = 1` assigns the value 1 to `p2`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `p2` is now 1, while the other variables retain their initial or given values.
