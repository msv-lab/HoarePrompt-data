Output State: **`idx1` is less than `idx2`; `l` is `l2`; `a2` is inserted into `l2` at index `idx1`; `p1`, `p2`, `t`, `a1`, `l11`, `l22`, `val` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `l = l2` assigns the value of `l2` to the variable `l`. This does not affect the values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `a2`, `p1`, `p2`, `t`, `a1`, `l11`, `l22`, and `val`. The insertion of `a2` into `l2` at index `idx1` remains unchanged as well.
