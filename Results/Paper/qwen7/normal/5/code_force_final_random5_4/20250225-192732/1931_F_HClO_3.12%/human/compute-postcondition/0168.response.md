Output State: The loop will execute `m-2` times in total. After all iterations, an input is taken but not assigned to any variable, and `m` must be greater than 3.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the following conditions will hold true:
- The loop has taken in `m-2` inputs, each time without assigning the input to any variable.
- The value of `m` must be greater than 3 for the loop to run at least 3 times.
