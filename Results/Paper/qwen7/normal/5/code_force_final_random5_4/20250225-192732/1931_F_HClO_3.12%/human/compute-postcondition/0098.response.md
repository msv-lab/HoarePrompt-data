Output State: **`idx1` is either -1 or 0; `idx2` is either -1 or 0; `p1` is either 0 or 1; `p2` is either 0 or 1; `val` is an empty list; `a2` is inserted into `l2` at the position specified by `idx1`.**

The code `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the element `a2` into the list `l2` at the index specified by `idx1`. Since `idx1` is either -1 or 0, `a2` is inserted at either the end or the beginning of the list `l2`. The values of `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `val` remain unchanged.
