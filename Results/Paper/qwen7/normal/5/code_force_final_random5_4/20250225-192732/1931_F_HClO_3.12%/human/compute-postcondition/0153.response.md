Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `idx1` is either -1 or 0, `idx2` is either -1 or 0, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, and `t` is 0.**

The `input()` function is called without any arguments, which means it will wait for user input but does not assign the input to any variable. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
