Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n - 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is given as follows:
   - `idx1` is an integer
   - `idx2` is an integer
   - `p1` is an integer
   - `p2` is an integer
   - The condition `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]` determines whether the loop breaks.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the value of `i` and `n` will determine if the loop should continue.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `i < n - 1`, we need to increment `i` by 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise.

5. **Check the condition for breaking the loop**: The condition `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]` is checked at each iteration. If this condition is met, the loop breaks. However, since we are asked to consider the state before the loop breaks, we assume the condition is not met, and the loop continues.

6. **Update the state**: Based on the above points, we update the state as follows:
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `n` remains the same.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`idx1` is an integer, `idx2` is an integer, `p1` is an integer, `p2` is an integer, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is `n`**.
