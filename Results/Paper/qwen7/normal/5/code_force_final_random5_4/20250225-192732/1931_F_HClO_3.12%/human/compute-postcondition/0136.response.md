Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head involves the tuple `(a3, l3)` which is derived from the list `val`. Therefore, the relevant variables here are `val`, `a3`, and `l3`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The list `val` must contain at least 3 tuples because the loop runs for `m - 2` times, and `m` must be greater than 2.
   - For each iteration, `a3` is an integer input from the user.
   - `l3` is a list of integers obtained from the remaining inputs.

3. **Initial states of other variables**:
   - `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` remain in their initial states, which are either -1 or 0 for `idx1` and `idx2`, and either 0 or 1 for `p1` and `p2`.
   - `m` remains unchanged and must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute at least 3 times.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the list `val` contains at least 3 tuples before the loop starts executing. 

**Step-by-step adjustment**:
- Ensure that `val` has at least 3 tuples.
- Ensure that `m` is greater than 2.

Since the other variables (`idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`) are not directly involved in the loop head and their initial states are specified, they do not need to be adjusted.

**Final State**:
State: **`val` is a list containing at least 3 tuples, each of the form (a3, l3), `m` must be greater than 2, `idx1` is either -1 or 0, `idx2` is either -1 or 0, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1**
