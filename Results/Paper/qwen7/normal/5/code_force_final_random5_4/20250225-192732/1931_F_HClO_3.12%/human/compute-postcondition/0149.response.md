Postcondition: **`val` is a list containing at least 2 tuples, each of the form (a3_next, l3_next), `m` is greater than 2, `idx1` is either -1 or 0, `idx2` is either -1 or 0, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, and if `l3` is not a list excluding all elements equal to `a3`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
