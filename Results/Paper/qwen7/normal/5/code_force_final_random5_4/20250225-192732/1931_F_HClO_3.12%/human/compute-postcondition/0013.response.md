Postcondition: `a1` is the first integer from the input split, `l11` is a list of integers from `l1` excluding `a2`, `n` is an integer input from the first split, `m` is 1, `a2` is the second integer from the input split, `l2` is a list containing the remaining integers from the input split, `l22` is a list of integers from `l2` excluding `a1`. The current state satisfies the condition that `l11` is not equal to `l22`.
