Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is `for _ in range(m - 2):`. The only variable involved here is `m`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `m - 2` is greater than 0, which means `m` must be greater than 2.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: `m` must be greater than or equal to 3.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must still be greater than or equal to 3 because the loop runs `m - 2` times, and if `m` was less than 3, the loop would not have started.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should remain the same as the current state, since `m` must still be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to continue.

**State: **`m` must be greater than or equal to 3**
