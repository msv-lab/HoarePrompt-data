Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer input from the first split, `m` is 1, and we continue the loop or iteration.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed directly to the next iteration. Since no variables are updated or reassigned within the `continue` statement itself, the values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. The precondition that we read an input but did not assign it to any variable also remains valid.
