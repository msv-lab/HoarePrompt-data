Output State: **`idx1` is an integer and greater than `idx2`, `idx2` is an integer, `p1` is an integer, `p2` is an integer, `val` is an empty list, `a1` is inserted into `l1` at index `idx2`.**

Explanation: The code `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the element `a1` into the list `l1` at the index specified by `idx2`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
