Output State: `m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from each input line converted to int, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from each input line converted to int, `val` is a list containing tuples `(a3, l3)` for each iteration of the loop.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `m` must still be greater than 2. For each iteration of the loop, `a3` is the first integer from the input line converted to an integer, and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from that input line also converted to integers. The list `val` contains a tuple `(a3, l3)` for each iteration of the loop, with these tuples appended sequentially.
