Output State: **`idx1` is 0, `idx2` is 0, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `i` is 0, `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, and `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`.**

Explanation: The code `idx1 = idx2 = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 0) to both `idx1` and `idx2`. The other variables (`p1`, `p2`, `l1[i + p1]`, and `l2[i + p2]`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. The condition `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, and `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1` also remains valid as no changes were made to these conditions.
