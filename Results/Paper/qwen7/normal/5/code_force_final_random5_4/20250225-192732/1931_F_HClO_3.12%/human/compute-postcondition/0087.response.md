Output State: **`idx1` is an integer, `idx2` is an integer, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional block where the conditions for setting `idx1` or `idx2` were being checked. The values of `idx1` and `idx2` remain unchanged, and the program exits the loop or conditional block.
