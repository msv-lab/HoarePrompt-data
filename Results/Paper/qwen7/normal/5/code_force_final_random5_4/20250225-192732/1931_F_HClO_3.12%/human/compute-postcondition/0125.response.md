Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the variable `m`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `m - 2` is greater than 0. This means `m` must be greater than 2.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that `m` is greater than 2 for the loop to execute. The other variables (`idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `a3`, `l3`, and `m`) do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute based on the given conditions.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `m` to be greater than 2.

**State:**
**`m` must be greater than 2**
