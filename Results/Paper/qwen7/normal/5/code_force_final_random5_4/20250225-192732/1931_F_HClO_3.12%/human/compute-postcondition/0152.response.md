Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `idx1` is either -1 or 0, `idx2` is either -1 or 0, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, and `t` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. The values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial state.
