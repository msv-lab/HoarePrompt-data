Postcondition: `idx1` and `idx2` are integers, `p1` and `p2` are integers, `n` is an integer at least 2, `i` is 0. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`, then `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0. Otherwise, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 1, and the value of `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to the value of `l2[i + p2]`, and `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`.
