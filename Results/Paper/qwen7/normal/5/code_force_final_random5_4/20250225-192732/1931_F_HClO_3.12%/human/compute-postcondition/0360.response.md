Output State: **`idx1` is `i + 1`, `idx2` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `idx1`, `idx2`, or `n`. It simply indicates that the program would exit the current loop or conditional block it was in. Therefore, the values of `idx1` and `idx2` remain unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be greater than `i + 1` still holds true.
