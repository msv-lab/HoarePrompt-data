Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n - 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop head variables**:
   - `i` is not explicitly mentioned in the given state, but it is initialized to 0 when the loop starts (since `range(n - 1)` starts from 0).
   - `n` is not explicitly mentioned in the given state either, but it is required for the loop to execute.

3. **Adjust the states based on the loop condition**: For the loop to execute, `n - 1` must be at least 1 (because `range(n - 1)` will generate numbers from 0 to `n - 2`). This means `n` must be at least 2.

4. **Adjust the state of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 0`, we don't need to change the value of `i` explicitly, but we need to ensure that the loop can start with `i = 0`.

5. **Final state adjustment**: We need to ensure that `n` is at least 2, and `i` is 0 at the start of the loop.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 0**
