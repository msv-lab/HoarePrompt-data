Output State: **`idx1` is either -1 or 0; `idx2` is either -1 or 0; `p1` is either 0 or 1; `p2` is either 0 or 1; `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is an integer input from the user, `l3` is a list of integers obtained from the remaining inputs; `m` is `-1`.**

Explanation: The variable `m` is decremented by 1, changing its value from its initial state (which could be -1 or 0) to -1. All other variables remain unchanged.
