Output State: **`idx1` is either -1 or 0, `idx2` is either -1 or 0, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The given code initializes an empty list `val`. This list does not affect the values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, or `p2`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The only new variable introduced is `val`, which is initialized as an empty list.
