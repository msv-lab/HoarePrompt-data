Output State: **`a3` is an integer from the input split, `l3` is a list containing the remaining integers from the input split, `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`**.

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. This means that `val` now contains one additional element, which is the tuple consisting of `a3` and `l3`. The values of `a3` and `l3` remain unchanged from their initial states.
