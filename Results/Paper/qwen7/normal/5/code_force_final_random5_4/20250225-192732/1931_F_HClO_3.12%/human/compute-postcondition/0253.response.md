Output State: **`idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`; `val` is an empty list; `p1`, `p2`, `t`, `a1`, `t`, `a2`, `l11`, `a3` is an integer read from input; `l22` is a set based on the final state of the loop after all iterations; `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`; `l` is assigned the value of `l1`.**

The code `l = l1` simply assigns the reference of `l1` to the variable `l`. This does not change the values of any variables or create new ones. It just changes which list the variable `l` refers to. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
