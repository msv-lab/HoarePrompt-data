Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to check if the initial orders of the screenshots are consistent with the final order after inserting the respective user at the top. This can lead to incorrect results.

Consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
4 2
1 2 3 4
4 2 3 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
```

However, the provided program might incorrectly output `YES` because it does not properly verify the consistency of the initial orders of the screenshots.

To illustrate, let's walk through the provided program with the above input:

1. The first screenshot shows `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
2. The second screenshot shows `[4, 2, 3, 1]`.

The program checks if the elements in the second screenshot (after removing the user who took the screenshot) match the elements in the first screenshot (after removing the user who took the screenshot). In this case, it would check if `[2, 3, 1]` matches `[2, 3, 1]`, which they do. However, it does not ensure that the initial orders are consistent with the final order after inserting the respective user at the top.

A correct approach would involve verifying that the initial orders of the screenshots are consistent with the final order after inserting the respective user at the top. The provided program lacks this verification step, leading to potential incorrect outputs.
