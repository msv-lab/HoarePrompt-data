Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `idx1` is either -1 or 0, `idx2` is either -1 or 0, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `t` is 0, `a1` is the first integer from input, `l11` is a list of elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `a2` is the second integer from input, and `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from input after splitting the input.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `l11` which contains all elements from `l1` except for `a2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
