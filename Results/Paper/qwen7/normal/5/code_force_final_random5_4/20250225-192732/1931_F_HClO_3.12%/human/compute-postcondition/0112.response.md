Output State: **`idx1` is either -1 or 0, `idx2` is either -1 or 0, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `val` is an empty list, `a3` is an integer input from the user, `l3` is a list of integers obtained from the remaining inputs, the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`; `l1` has `a1` inserted at position `idx2`.**

Explanation: The code `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the element `a1` into the list `l1` at the specified index `idx2`. Since `idx2` is either -1 or 0, `a1` is inserted at the beginning or end of `l1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
