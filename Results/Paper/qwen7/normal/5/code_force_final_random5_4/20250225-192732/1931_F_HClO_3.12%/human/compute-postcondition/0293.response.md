The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` (which is a placeholder for the loop index) and the variable `t` (the total number of iterations). Since the loop has executed successfully without breaking, the loop can execute again if `t` is greater than the current value of the loop index.

At the end of the previous iteration, `m` must be greater than 2, `val` contains a list of tuples where each tuple consists of `a3` and `l3` from each iteration, and the loop has executed successfully without breaking. This means that the loop has completed one full iteration, and `t` must have been decremented by 1.

To determine the new state for the next iteration, we need to consider that the loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 1.

State: **`m` must be greater than 2, `val` contains a list of tuples where each tuple consists of `a3` and `l3` from each iteration, and `t` must be greater than 1**
