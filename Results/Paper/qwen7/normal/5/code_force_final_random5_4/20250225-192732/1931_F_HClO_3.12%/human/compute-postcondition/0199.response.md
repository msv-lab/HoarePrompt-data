Postcondition: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n - 1` or `n - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `idx1` is greater than or equal to 0, then `idx2` is also greater than or equal to 0.**

This postcondition summarizes that after executing the if-else block, `n` remains at least 2, the relationship between `i`, `p1`, and `p2` holds, and the break condition is met. Furthermore, if `idx1` is valid (greater than or equal to 0), then `idx2` must also be valid (greater than or equal to 0).
