Output State: **`a1` is the first element of the input split into integers, `l1` is the rest of the elements split into a list of integers, `a2` is the first element of the input split into integers, and `l2` is the rest of the elements split into a list of integers.**

Explanation: The code `a2, *l2 = map(int, input().split())` takes the input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and then assigns the first element to `a2` and the rest of the elements to `l2`. The values of `n`, `m`, `val`, `a1`, and `l1` remain unchanged.
