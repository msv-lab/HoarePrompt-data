Output State: **`expression` must have at least one character remaining; `balance` is increased by 1.**

The code `balance += 1` increments the value of `balance` by 1. Since the initial state of `expression` is that it must have at least one character remaining, this condition is still valid after the code execution. The value of `balance` is updated by adding 1 to its current value.
