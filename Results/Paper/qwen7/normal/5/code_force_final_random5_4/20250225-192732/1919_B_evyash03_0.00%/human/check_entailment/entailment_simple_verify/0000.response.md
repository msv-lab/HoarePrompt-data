### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotated code to understand how it processes the input and calculates the result.

#### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to minimize the total penalty by splitting the array `a` into subarrays and then calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of the sum of its elements multiplied by its length.

#### Program Analysis
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `s` and the string `s` itself.
   
2. **Splitting the String**:
   - The string `s` is split into parts using the character `'-'` as a delimiter. This creates a list of substrings where each substring consists only of `'+'` characters.
   - The variable `result_length` is calculated as the sum of the lengths of these substrings.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is called with the original string `expression` and the `result_length`.
   - It iterates through the string `expression` and maintains a `balance` to keep track of the difference between the number of `'+'` and `'-'` characters.
   - If `balance` becomes negative, it increments the `count` and resets `balance` to 0.
   - Finally, it returns the `count` plus 1 if `balance` is greater than 0.

#### Correctness Evaluation
- **Handling of Substrings**: The program correctly identifies substrings of `'+'` characters separated by `'-'`. However, this does not directly help in minimizing the penalty.
- **Penalty Calculation**: The function `func_1` counts the number of times the balance goes negative, which does not align with the actual penalty calculation. The penalty should be based on the sum of elements in each subarray, not just the number of segments.

#### Example Test Case
Consider the example test case provided:
```
1
6
+-+-+-
```

- The string `s` is `+-+-+-`.
- Splitting by `'-'` gives `['+', '-', '+', '-', '+']`.
- The function `func_1` will count the number of times the balance goes negative, which is 3 times (at the second, fourth, and sixth positions).

The expected output is `0` because the optimal way to split the array is `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])`, resulting in a penalty of `0`.

However, the program outputs `4` because it counts the number of segments where the balance changes, which is 3, plus 1 (since `balance` is not negative at the end).

#### Conclusion
The original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` is counting the number of segments where the balance changes, which does not align with the actual penalty calculation required.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
