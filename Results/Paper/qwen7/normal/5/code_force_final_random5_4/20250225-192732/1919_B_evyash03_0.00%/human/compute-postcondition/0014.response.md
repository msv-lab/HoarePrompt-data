Output State: **`expression` must have at least one character, `balance` is 0, `count` is increased by 1**

Explanation: The code `balance = 0` sets the value of `balance` to 0. The initial state of `expression` and `count` remains unchanged. Therefore, `expression` must still have at least one character, `balance` is now 0, and `count` is increased by 1.
