Output State: The entire `expression` has been processed, `balance` is 0, `count` is equal to the number of times `balance` became negative during the iteration of the `expression`, and `char` will be the last character of the original `expression`.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `expression` will be fully consumed (i.e., exhausted), `balance` will be 0 indicating that any + and - characters have balanced out, `count` will reflect the total number of times `balance` went below zero, and `char` will point to the last character of the original `expression`.
