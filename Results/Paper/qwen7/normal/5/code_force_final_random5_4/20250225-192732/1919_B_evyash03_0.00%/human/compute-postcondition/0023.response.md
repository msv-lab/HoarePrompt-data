Output State: **`count` is increased by 1, and `expression` must have at least one character remaining, and `balance` is either increased by 1 if `char` is '+', or decreased by 1 if `char` is not '+'**.

This means that the `count` variable has been incremented by 1, while the conditions for `expression`, `balance`, and `char` remain as specified in the initial state.
