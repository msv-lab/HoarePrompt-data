Output State: **`expression` must have at least one character remaining, `balance` is 0, and `count` is 2.**

Explanation: The code sets `balance` to 0, which changes its value from the initial state where it was either 1 or -1. The `expression`, `count`, and `char` remain unchanged from their initial states.
