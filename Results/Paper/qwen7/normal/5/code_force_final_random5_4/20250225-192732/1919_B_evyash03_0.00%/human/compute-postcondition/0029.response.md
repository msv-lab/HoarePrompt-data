Output State: **`expression` must have at least one character remaining, `balance` is -1, and `count` is increased by 1 if `balance` was already less than 0, and `char` will be the first character of the current `expression`.**

Explanation: The code `balance -= 1` decreases the value of `balance` by 1. Given that the initial value of `balance` is 0, after executing this line, `balance` becomes -1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
