Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` is not designed to calculate penalties according to the rules specified. Instead, it counts the number of segments that need to be split based on the balance of '+' and '-' characters, which is not relevant to the penalty calculation.

To solve this problem correctly, the program should calculate the penalty based on the optimal way to split the array into subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized. The current implementation does not achieve this.
