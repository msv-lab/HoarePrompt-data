Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for char in expression:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `char` and `expression`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - The loop iterates over each character in `expression`.
   - For each iteration, `char` takes the value of the current character being processed.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `expression` must have at least one character.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `expression` must have at least one character.
   - The loop checks if `balance` is less than 0, and if so, increases `count` by 1. Otherwise, `balance` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `expression` has at least one character, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `expression`.
   - After processing one character from `expression`, `expression` will have one less character than it had at the start of the previous iteration.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `expression` must have at least one character remaining for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`expression` must have at least one character remaining**
