Postcondition: **`maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `n` is an integer converted from the original `n`, `k` is an integer converted from the original `k`, `pb` is an integer converted from the original `pb`, `ps` is an integer converted from the original `ps`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `b` is a list containing either two elements where the first element is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and the second element is `maxa`, or two elements where the first element is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and the second element is `a[pb - 1]`, `s` is a list containing either two elements where the first element is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and the second element is `a[ps - 1]`, or two elements where the first element is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and the second element is `maxa`, `founds` is `False`, `foundb` is `False`, `i` is 2, and `k` is greater than 0. If `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, then `founds` is `True` and `ps` remains as `p[ps - 1]`. Otherwise, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]` and `a[ps - 1]` is included in the lists `b` and `s`.**
