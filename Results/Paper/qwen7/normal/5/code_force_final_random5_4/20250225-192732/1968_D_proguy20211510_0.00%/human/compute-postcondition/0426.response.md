Output State: **`i` is 5, `rem` is `k - i - 1`, `ptsb` contains the value `preb[1] + (k - 1) * b[1] + preb[4] + (k - i - 1) * b[4]`, `ptss` contains the value `pres[3] + (k - 1) * s[3]`, and `ptss` is appended with the value `pres[4] + (k - i - 1) * s[4]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `rem` to `k - (i + 1)`. Given that `i` is initially 5, `rem` is now `k - (5 + 1)`, which simplifies to `k - 6`. All other variables (`ptsb`, `ptss`, `preb`, `pres`, `b`, `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
