Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is an integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\), `founds` is False, `s` is a list with two elements \([(k - (1 + 1)) * maxa, a[ps - 1]]\), `b` is a list with two elements \([b[0], a[pb - 1]]\), and `a[ps - 1] != maxa**.

Explanation: The code appends `a[ps - 1]` to the list `s`. Given that `s` initially contains one element \((k - (1 + 1)) * maxa\), after appending `a[ps - 1]`, `s` now contains two elements: \((k - (1 + 1)) * maxa\) and `a[ps - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
