Output State: **`preb` is an empty list, `pres` is an empty list**.

Explanation: The code initializes two empty lists `preb` and `pres`. Since these lists were just initialized and no elements were added to them within the given code snippet, they remain empty. All other variables (`i`, `k`, `foundb`, `founds`, `b`, `s`, `pb`, `ps`, `a`, `maxa`, `p`) retain their states from the initial condition, which means `i` is equal to `k`, `foundb` and `founds` maintain their boolean values, and the lists `b` and `s` are updated according to the loop's logic. However, since the code snippet only initializes `preb` and `pres`, their values are specifically noted here.
