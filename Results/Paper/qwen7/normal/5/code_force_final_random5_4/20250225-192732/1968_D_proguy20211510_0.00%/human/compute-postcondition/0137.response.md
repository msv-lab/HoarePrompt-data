Output State: **`i` is less than \( k^2 \); `rem` is \( k - i - 1 \); `ptss` is a list with an additional element which is `pres[i] + (k - i - 1) * s[i]`; `ptsb` is a list with one additional element which is `preb[i] + (k - i - 1) * b[i]`**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the `ptss` list. This new element is calculated as `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`. Here, `rem` is defined as \( k - i - 1 \), so the new element in `ptss` is `pres[i] + (k - i - 1) * s[i]`. The `ptsb` list remains unchanged from its previous state, which includes one additional element `preb[i] + (k - i - 1) * b[i]`. All other variables and their conditions remain as they were in the initial state.
