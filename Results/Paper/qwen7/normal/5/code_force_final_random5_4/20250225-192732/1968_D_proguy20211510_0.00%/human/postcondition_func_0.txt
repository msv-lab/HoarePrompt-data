The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers \( n \), \( k \), \( P_B \), and \( P_S \), a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \), and an array \( a \) of positive integers. For each test case, it determines the winner between Sasha and Bodya based on the values in \( a \) at specific indices and their permutations. If the maximum value in \( a \) is at both specified indices, it prints 'Draw'. Otherwise, it calculates the cumulative sums of points for Sasha and Bodya over \( k \) iterations, considering the permutations and the maximum value in \( a \). Finally, it prints 'Sasha' if her cumulative points are higher, 'Bodya' if his are higher, or 'Draw' if they are equal.
