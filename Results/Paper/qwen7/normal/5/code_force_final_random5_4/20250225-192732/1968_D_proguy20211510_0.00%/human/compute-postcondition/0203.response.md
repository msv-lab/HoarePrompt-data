Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is a positive integer, `foundb` is either True or False, `founds` is True, `b` contains elements which are `(k - 1) * maxa`, and `s` contains an element which is `(k - 2) * maxa`. The last element of `a` is equal to `maxa`.**

Explanation: The code sets `founds` to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
