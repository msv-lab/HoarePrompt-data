Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is a positive integer, `foundb` is either True or False, `founds` is True, `b` contains elements which are `(k - 1) * maxa` and possibly `a[pb - 1]`, and `s` now contains the elements `(k - 2) * maxa` and `maxa`.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends `maxa` to the list `s`. Initially, `s` contains the element `(k - 2) * maxa`. After appending `maxa`, `s` now contains both `(k - 2) * maxa` and `maxa`. All other variables remain unchanged.
