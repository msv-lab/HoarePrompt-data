Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `n` is an integer converted from the original `n`, `k` is greater than 0, `pb` is an integer converted from the original `pb`, `ps` is an integer converted from the original `ps`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `b` now contains the last element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` appended to it, `s` is a list containing four elements where the first element is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, the second element is `maxa`, the third element is either `maxa` or `a[ps - 1]`, and the fourth element is either `maxa` or `a[ps - 1]`, `founds` is `True` if `a[pb - 1]` equals `maxa` or `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`, otherwise `founds` is `False`, `foundb` is `True` if `a[pb - 1]` equals `maxa`, otherwise `foundb` is `False`, `i` is 4, `preb` is an empty list, `pres` is an empty list, `sb` is 0, `ss` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(s)):
    preb.append(sb + b[i])
    sb += b[i]
    pres.append(ss + s[i])
    ss += s[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 5; `ss` is `ss + s[5]`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 9; `ss` is updated to include `s[9]`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 11; `preb` includes the value of `sb + b[i]`; `ss` is updated to include `s[9] + s[i]`; `sb` is updated to `sb + b[i]`; `pres` includes the value of `ss + s[i]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
