Output State: **`b` is a list containing the value `a[ps - 1]` appended to it if `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa` and `foundb` is True, otherwise it remains unchanged; `s` contains the value `a[ps - 1]` appended to it; `pb` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`; `foundb` remains unchanged; `a` and `p` remain unchanged.**

This means that the value `a[ps - 1]` is appended to the list `s`. The list `b` is modified only if `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa` and `foundb` is True, in which case `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` is appended to `b`. In all other cases, `b` remains unchanged. The variable `pb` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`, and the flags `foundb` and the lists `a` and `p` remain unchanged.
