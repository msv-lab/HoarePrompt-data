Output State: **`maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `maxs, maxb = max(ptss), max(ptsb)` calculates the maximum value from the lists `ptss` and `ptsb` and assigns these maximum values to `maxs` and `maxb` respectively. No other variables are affected. The output state retains the preconditions where `ptsb` and `ptss` contain their respective calculated elements, and introduces two new variables `maxs` and `maxb` holding the maximum values from those lists.
