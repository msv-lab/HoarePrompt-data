Output State: **`maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are strings split from the input.**

The code splits the input into four variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`. Since the input value is decreased by 1, the exact numerical values of these variables cannot be determined without knowing the original input. However, they are now stored as strings. The values of `maxs` and `maxb` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the input operation.
