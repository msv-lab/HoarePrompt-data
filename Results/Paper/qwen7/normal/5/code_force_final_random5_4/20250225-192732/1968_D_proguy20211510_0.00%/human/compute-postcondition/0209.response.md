Postcondition: `i` is 2, `k` is a positive integer, `foundb` is either True or False, `founds` is True if `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`, otherwise it is False, `b` contains elements which are `(k - 1) * maxa`, and `s` contains elements which are `(k - 2) * maxa` and `a[ps - 1]`, and `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1]` does not equal `maxa`.
