Output State: **`i` is 2; `preb` is a list containing the string `sb + b[0]`; `sb` is equal to `sb + b[1]`.**

Explanation: The code `sb += b[i]` appends the element `b[i]` (where `i` is currently 1) to the string `sb`. Given that `i` was initially 1, it is now incremented to 2. The variable `preb` remains unchanged as it is a list containing the string `sb + b[0]`. The value of `sb` is updated to `sb + b[1]`.
