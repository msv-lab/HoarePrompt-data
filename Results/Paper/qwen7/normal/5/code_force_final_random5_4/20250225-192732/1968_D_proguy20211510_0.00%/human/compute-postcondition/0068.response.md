Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is an integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\), `founds` is True if `a[ps - 1] == maxa` is true, otherwise it is False, `s` is a list with two elements \([(k - 2) * maxa, a[ps - 1]]\), `b` is a list with three elements \([b[0], a[pb - 1], (k - (i + 1)) * maxa]\), and `ps` is `p[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1] != maxa**.

Explanation: The code appends `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` to the list `b`. Given that `i` is 3, the expression simplifies to `(k - (3 + 1)) * maxa` which is `(k - 4) * maxa`. Since `b` was initially a list with two elements \([b[0], a[pb - 1]]\), after appending, `b` becomes a list with three elements \([b[0], a[pb - 1], (k - 4) * maxa]\). All other variables remain unchanged.
