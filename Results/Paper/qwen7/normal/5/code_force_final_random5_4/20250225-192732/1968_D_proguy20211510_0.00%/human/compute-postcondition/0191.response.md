Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is a positive integer, `foundb` is False, `founds` is True, `b` contains an element which is `(k - 1) * maxa` and an additional element which is `a[pb - 1]`, and `s` contains an element which is `(k - 2) * maxa`.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(a[pb - 1])` appends the value of `a[pb - 1]` to the list `b`. Given the initial conditions, `b` initially contains one element, which is `(k - 1) * maxa`. After appending `a[pb - 1]`, `b` now contains two elements: `(k - 1) * maxa` and `a[pb - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
