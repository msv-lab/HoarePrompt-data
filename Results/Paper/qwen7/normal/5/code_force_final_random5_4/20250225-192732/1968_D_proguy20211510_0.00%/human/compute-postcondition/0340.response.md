Output State: **`maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `n` is an integer converted from the original `n`, `k` is an integer converted from the original `k`, `pb` is an integer converted from the original `pb`, `ps` is an integer converted from the original `ps`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `b` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and the second element is `a[pb - 1]`, `s` is a list containing one element which is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `founds` is `False`, `foundb` is `False`, `i` is 2, and `k` is greater than 0. Additionally, `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`.**

Explanation: The code appends `a[pb - 1]` to the list `b`. Given that `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, the updated list `b` now contains two elements: the first element is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and the second element is `a[pb - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
