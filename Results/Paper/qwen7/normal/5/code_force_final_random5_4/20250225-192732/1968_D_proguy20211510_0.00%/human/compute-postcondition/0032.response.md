Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is an integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\), `foundb` is True, `founds` is True, `b` is a list with one element \((k - (0 + 1)) * maxa\), `s` is a list with one element \((k - (1 + 1)) * maxa\)**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or conditional block. In this case, it does not affect any of the variables listed in the initial state. Therefore, all the variables retain their original values, and the only change is that we break out of the loop or conditional block we were inside.
