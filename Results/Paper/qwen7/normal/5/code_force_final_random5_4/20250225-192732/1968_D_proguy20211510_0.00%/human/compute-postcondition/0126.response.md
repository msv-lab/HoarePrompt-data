Output State: **`i` is `k+3`, `len(s)` is `k^2`, `sb` is `sb + b[k+2] + b[k+3]`, `pres` is `pres + ss + s[k+3] + s[k+3]`, `ss` is `ss + s[k+3] + s[k+3] + s[k+3]`, `preb` is `[sb + b[k+2], sb + b[k+3]]`, `pres` is appended with `ss + s[k+3]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains unchanged and is still `k+3`.
- The length of `s` (`len(s)`) remains unchanged and is still `k^2`.
- The value of `sb` remains unchanged and is still `sb + b[k+2] + b[k+3]`.
- The value of `pres` remains unchanged and is still `pres + ss + s[k+3] + s[k+3]`.
- The value of `ss` is updated to `ss + s[k+3] + s[k+3] + s[k+3]` because `ss += s[i]` and `i` is `k+3`.
- The value of `preb` remains unchanged and is still `[sb + b[k+2], sb + b[k+3]]`.
- The value of `pres` is appended with `ss + s[k+3]` which is `ss + s[k+3] + s[k+3] + s[k+3]`.
