Output State: **`i` is 1; `preb` is a list containing the string `sb + b[0]`; `sb` is unchanged; `b` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `sb + b[i]` to the list `preb`. Initially, `i` is 0, so `sb + b[i]` becomes `sb + b[0]`. After appending this string to `preb`, `i` is incremented by 1 (though the increment operation itself is not shown in the snippet, it's implied by the index used). The values of `sb` and `b` remain unchanged.
