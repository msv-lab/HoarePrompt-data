Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is an integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\), `founds` is True if `a[ps - 1] == maxa` is true, otherwise it is False, `s` is a list with three elements \([(k - 2) * maxa, a[ps - 1], (k - (i + 1)) * maxa]\), `b` is a list with three elements \([b[0], a[pb - 1], (k - (i + 1)) * maxa]\), and `ps` is `p[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1] != maxa**.

Explanation: The code appends `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` to the list `s`. Given that `i` is 3, the value being appended is `(k - (3 + 1)) * maxa` which simplifies to `(k - 4) * maxa`. This new value is added to the existing list `s` which originally had two elements \([(k - 2) * maxa, a[ps - 1]]\). Now, `s` has three elements: \[(k - 2) * maxa, a[ps - 1], (k - 4) * maxa\]. The values of `k`, `founds`, `s`, `b`, and `ps` remain unchanged from their initial states except for the updated list `s`.
