Output State: **`i` is 4, `k` is an integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\), `founds` is True, `s` is a list with five elements \([(k - 2) * maxa, a[ps - 1], (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, a[ps - 1], (k - (i + 1)) * maxa]\), `b` is a list with five elements \([b[0], a[pb - 1], (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, maxa]\) if `foundb` is True, or \([b[0], a[pb - 1], (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, (k - (i + 1)) * maxa, a[pb - 1]]\) if `foundb` is False, and either `b` is appended with `maxa` or `pb` is incremented by 1 if `a[pb - 1] != maxa` and `foundb` is False.**

Explanation: The code sets `founds` to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
