The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, the given code snippet does not show which loop the `continue` statement is part of. Since no variables are modified or new conditions are introduced by the `continue` statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `n` is an integer converted from the original `n`, `k` is an integer converted from the original `k`, `pb` is an integer converted from the original `pb`, `ps` is an integer converted from the original `ps`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`.**
