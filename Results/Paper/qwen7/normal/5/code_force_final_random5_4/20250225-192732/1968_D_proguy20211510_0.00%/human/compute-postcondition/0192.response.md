Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is a positive integer, `foundb` is False, `founds` is True, `b` contains an element which is `(k - 1) * maxa` and an additional element which is `a[pb - 1]`, `s` contains an element which is `(k - 2) * maxa`, `pb` is equal to `p[pb - 1]`.**

The code `pb = p[pb - 1]` updates the value of `pb` to the value of `p[pb - 1]`. However, the initial value of `pb` was not specified, so we cannot determine its exact new value without knowing the contents of the list `p`. Nonetheless, we know that `pb` now holds the value of `p[pb - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
