### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The function correctly parses the input values for `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`.
   - It also correctly reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Initial Checks**:
   - The function checks if both players start with the maximum value in the array `a`. If both players start with the maximum value, it prints 'Draw'.
     - **Issue**: This check is incomplete. The function should consider the scenario where only one player starts with the maximum value. The current implementation will incorrectly print 'Draw' if both players start with the same maximum value, even if one player has a better strategy.

3. **Single Maximum Value Check**:
   - The function checks if either player starts with the maximum value in the array `a`. If one player starts with the maximum value, it prints 'Bodya' or 'Sasha' accordingly.
     - **Issue**: This check is correct, but it should be combined with the previous check to handle the case where both players start with the same maximum value.

4. **Dynamic Score Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the scores for both players using a dynamic approach.
     - **Issue**: The dynamic calculation is flawed. The function assumes that the players will always move to the next position in the permutation if they do not already have the maximum value. However, the players can strategically choose to stay at their current position if it gives them a higher score. The current implementation does not account for this strategic choice.

5. **Final Score Comparison**:
   - After calculating the potential scores, the function compares the final scores of both players and prints the result accordingly.
     - **Issue**: The final comparison is based on the cumulative sums of points, but it does not consider the strategic choices of the players. The function should simulate the optimal moves for both players to determine the winner accurately.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is **inaccurate** because it fails to address the following issues:
- The initial check for both players starting with the maximum value should be handled correctly.
- The dynamic score calculation does not account for the optimal strategic choices of the players.
- The final score comparison should consider the optimal moves of both players.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
