Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is a positive integer, `foundb` is either True or False, `founds` is True if `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`, otherwise `founds` is True, `b` contains elements which are `(k - 1) * maxa` and possibly `a[pb - 1]`, and `b` now includes an additional element which is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, and `s` contains elements which are `(k - 2) * maxa` and possibly the last element of `s` is equal to `a[ps - 1]`**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `b`. The new element is calculated as `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. Given that `i` is 3, the new element becomes `(k - (3 + 1)) * maxa` which simplifies to `(k - 4) * maxa`. This new element is added to the existing elements in `b`, which originally contained elements that are `(k - 1) * maxa` and possibly `a[pb - 1]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
