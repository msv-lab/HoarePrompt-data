Output State: **`n` is an integer converted from the first input value minus 1, `k` is an integer converted from the second input value, `pb` is an integer converted from the third input value, `ps` is an integer converted from the fourth input value, `maxs` is the maximum value among the elements in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value among the elements in `ptsb`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())`**.

This means that the value of `n` has been decremented by 1, while `k`, `pb`, and `ps` remain unchanged. The variable `p` is now a list of integers obtained from the next input, which is split and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `maxs` and `maxb` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the new input.
