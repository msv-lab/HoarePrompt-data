Output State: **`i` is `k+1`, `len(s)` is `k^2`, `sb` is `preb[-1] + b[i-1]`, `pres` is `ss + s[i]`, `ss` is `ss + s[i]`**

Explanation: The code `ss += s[i]` increments the value of `ss` by `s[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` remains `k+1`, `len(s)` remains `k^2`, `sb` remains `preb[-1] + b[i-1]`, and `pres` remains `ss + s[i]`, while `ss` is updated to `ss + s[i]`.
