Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is a positive integer, `foundb` is either True or False, `founds` is True if `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`, otherwise `founds` is True, `b` contains elements which are `(k - 1) * maxa` and possibly `a[pb - 1]`, and `b` now includes an additional element which is `(k - 4) * maxa`, and `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`, and `s` contains elements which are `(k - 2) * maxa` and possibly the last element of `s` is equal to `a[ps - 1]`, and `s` now includes an additional element which is `(k - 4) * maxa`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Explanation: The code `pb = p[pb - 1]` updates the value of `pb` to the value of `p[pb - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
