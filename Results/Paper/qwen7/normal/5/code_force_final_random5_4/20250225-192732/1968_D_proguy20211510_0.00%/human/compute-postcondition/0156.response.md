Postcondition: `maxs` is the maximum value among the elements in `ptss`; `maxb` is the maximum value among the elements in `ptsb`. After the if-else block executes, the relationship between `maxs` and `maxb` remains unchanged, meaning `maxs` will still be the maximum value among the elements in `ptss` and `maxb` will still be the maximum value among the elements in `ptsb`.
