Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of the Variables**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq P_B, P_S \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\).
   - `p` is a permutation of length `n`.
   - `a` is an array of positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\).
   - `YES` and `NO` are string values `'YES'` and `'NO'` respectively.
   - `MOD` is set to \(10^9 + 7\).
   - `alpha` is a string containing the characters `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`.

3. **Adjust the State for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop will execute based on the value of `int(input())`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `int(input())` is a valid input that allows the loop to run.
   - Since `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the input should be within this range.

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the value of `int(input())` to be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`int(input())` must be a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4**
