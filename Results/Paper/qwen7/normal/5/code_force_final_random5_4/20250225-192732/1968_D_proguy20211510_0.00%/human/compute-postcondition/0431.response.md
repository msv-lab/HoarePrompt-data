Postcondition: **maxs is the maximum value of the cumulative sum of `pres` from index 3 to the last index plus the contribution of `rem` for each element in `s`; maxb is the maximum value of the cumulative sum of `preb` from index 1 to the last index plus the contribution of `rem` for each element in `b`. The current value of `maxs` is greater than the current value of `maxb`.**
