Postcondition: `i` is 3, `k` is an integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\), `founds` is True if `a[ps - 1] == maxa` is true, otherwise it is False, `s` is a list with three elements \([(k - 2) * maxa, a[ps - 1], (k - (i + 1)) * maxa]\), `b` is a list with three elements \([b[0], a[pb - 1], (k - (i + 1)) * maxa]\), and `ps` is `p[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1] != maxa`, assuming the condition `foundb and founds` is true. If the condition `foundb and founds` is false, the values of `s` and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
