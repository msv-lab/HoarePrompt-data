Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an integer input from the user, split by space.
- `m` is an integer input from the user, split by space.
- The condition states that `n` is less than `m` or `(n - m) % 2` is not equal to 0.

Given this condition, the `print('NO')` statement will always execute because either `n < m` or `(n - m) % 2 != 0` must be true according to the problem statement.

Output: **'NO'**
