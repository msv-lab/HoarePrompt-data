Reasoning:
The function correctly implements the logic required to determine whether it's possible to end up with exactly \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case independently.
2. **Conditions Check**: For each test case, the function checks two conditions:
   - \( n \geq m \): This ensures that there are enough moves to potentially reach \( m \) cubes.
   - \( (n - m) \% 2 == 0 \): This condition ensures that the difference between \( n \) and \( m \) is even, which means the number of additions and removals can balance out to result in exactly \( m \) cubes.
3. **Output**: Based on these conditions, the function prints 'YES' or 'NO' appropriately.
4. **Independence of Iterations**: The function processes each test case independently without modifying the values of \( n \) and \( m \) between iterations, ensuring the integrity of each test case.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the function accurately implements the required logic and handles the constraints properly.

Correctness: **True**
