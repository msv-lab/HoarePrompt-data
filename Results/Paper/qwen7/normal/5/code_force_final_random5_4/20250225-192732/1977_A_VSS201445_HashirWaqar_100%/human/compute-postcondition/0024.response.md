Functionality: **The function processes a series of pairs of positive integers \( n \) and \( m \) (where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 100 \)) derived from a positive integer \( t \) (where \( 1 \leq t \leq 100 \)). For each pair, it checks if \( n \geq m \) and if \( n - m \) is even. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not modify the values of \( n \) and \( m \) between iterations and retains their original values throughout the process.**
