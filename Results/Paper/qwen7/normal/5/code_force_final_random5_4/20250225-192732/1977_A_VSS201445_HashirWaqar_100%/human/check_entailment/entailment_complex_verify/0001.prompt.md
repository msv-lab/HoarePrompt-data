You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and each test case consists of two positive integers n and m such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n` and `m` retain their original values throughout all iterations. The loop processes each pair of `n` and `m` independently based on the given conditions and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly but does not modify the values of `n` and `m` between iterations. Therefore, regardless of the number of iterations, `n` and `m` will always reflect the values they had at the start of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of pairs of positive integers \( n \) and \( m \) (where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 100 \)) derived from a positive integer \( t \) (where \( 1 \leq t \leq 100 \)). For each pair, it checks if \( n \geq m \) and if \( n - m \) is even. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not modify the values of \( n \) and \( m \) between iterations and retains their original values throughout the process.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a loop `for _ in range(t)`.

2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**:
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` using `map(int, input().split())`.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition `if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:` checks two things:
     - `n >= m`: This ensures that the total number of moves `n` is at least as many as the target number of cubes `m`.
     - `(n - m) % 2 == 0`: This ensures that the difference between `n` and `m` is even. This is necessary because each move either adds or removes one cube, meaning the parity (odd/even nature) of the difference must match for the operation to be possible.

4. **Output**:
   - If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Reasoning:
- The logic correctly handles the constraints and requirements of the problem.
- The condition `n >= m` ensures that there are enough moves to reach the target number of cubes.
- The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference in moves is even, which is necessary to balance adding and removing cubes.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
