### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the key aspects of the program and the problem. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step to ensure the program meets all the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a loop `for _ in range(t)`. This part is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**:
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` using `map(int, input().split())`. This is also correct and aligns with the problem description.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition `if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:` is the core logic of the program.
     - `n >= m`: This ensures that there are enough moves to potentially reach the target number of cubes `m`.
     - `(n - m) % 2 == 0`: This condition checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even. This is crucial because each move either adds or removes one cube, and the parity of the difference must match for the operations to be balanced.

4. **Output**:
   - If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Correctness of Conditions**:
  - The condition `n >= m` ensures that there are enough moves to potentially reach the target number of cubes `m`. If `n < m`, it's impossible to achieve `m` cubes.
  - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference between `n` and `m` is even. This is necessary because each move changes the number of cubes by exactly 1, and the difference must be even to balance the additions and subtractions.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If `n == m`, the difference is 0, which is even, and the condition is satisfied.
  - If `n > m`, the difference is positive and even, which is also valid.
  - If `n < m`, the difference is negative and odd, which is invalid.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It checks if there are enough moves (`n >= m`) and if the difference between `n` and `m` is even, ensuring that the operations can be balanced.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
