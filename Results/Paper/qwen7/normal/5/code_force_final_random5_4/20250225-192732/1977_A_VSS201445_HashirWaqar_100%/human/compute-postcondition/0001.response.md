Output State: **`n` is an integer input from the user split by space, `m` is an integer input from the user split by space**.

This means that the values of `n` and `m` are set to integers obtained from the user input, split by a space. The exact values of `n` and `m` depend on the input provided by the user, but they are now stored as integers in the variables `n` and `m` respectively.
