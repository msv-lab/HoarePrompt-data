Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to determine if it's possible for Nikita to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Loop Iteration**: The program iterates over each test case using a loop. This ensures that each pair of `n` and `m` is processed independently.
2. **Conditions Check**: For each pair `(n, m)`, the program checks two conditions:
   - `n >= m`: This condition ensures that the total number of moves (`n`) is at least as many as the desired number of cubes (`m`). If this condition fails, it's impossible to achieve `m` cubes because there aren't enough moves to add `m` cubes.
   - `(n - m) % 2 == 0`: This condition ensures that the difference between `n` and `m` is even. This is necessary because each move either adds or removes one cube, meaning the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of cubes must match the parity of the number of moves made to reach `m` from an initial state of zero cubes.
3. **Output**: Based on the above conditions, the program prints 'YES' if both conditions are met, indicating it's possible to achieve `m` cubes, and 'NO' otherwise.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly determines whether it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Correctness: **True**
