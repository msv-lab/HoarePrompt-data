Output State: The values of `n` and `m` will remain unchanged after all iterations of the loop. This is because the loop processes each input pair of `n` and `m` independently and does not modify their values within the loop. The loop simply prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the given conditions and then moves on to the next input pair without altering the original values of `n` and `m`. Therefore, regardless of how many times the loop runs, the initial values of `n` and `m` provided as input will not be modified.
