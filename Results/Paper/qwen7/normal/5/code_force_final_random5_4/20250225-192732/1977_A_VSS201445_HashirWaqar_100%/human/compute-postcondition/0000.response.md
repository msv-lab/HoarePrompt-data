Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input value used to determine the number of iterations.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` returns a positive integer. Since `t` is given to be a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), the input will always be valid for the loop to execute.

3. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**: We need to ensure that the input provided to `int(input())` is within the specified range (1 to 100) because this is the condition that determines the number of iterations of the loop.

4. **Adjust the state**: Given that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, we can set the initial state of the loop to reflect this. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the input value.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value itself, ensuring it falls within the required range.

**State:**
**`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and the input to `int(input())` must be within this range.**
