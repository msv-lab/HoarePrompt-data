Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a loop `for _ in range(t)`.

2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**:
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` using `map(int, input().split())`.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition `if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:` checks two things:
     - `n >= m`: This ensures that the total number of moves `n` is at least as many as the target number of cubes `m`.
     - `(n - m) % 2 == 0`: This ensures that the difference between `n` and `m` is even. This is necessary because each move either adds or removes one cube, meaning the parity (odd/even nature) of the difference must match for the operation to be possible.

4. **Output**:
   - If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Reasoning:
- The logic correctly handles the constraints and requirements of the problem.
- The condition `n >= m` ensures that there are enough moves to reach the target number of cubes.
- The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference in moves is even, which is necessary to balance adding and removing cubes.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
