Output State: **`i` is an element of `arr`, `pos` is increased by 1, `z_l` is decreased by 1 if `i` equals 0, otherwise `o_l` is increased by 1 and `o_r` is decreased by 1, `ans` is `pos`, the condition `o_r` is greater than or equal to half of `(z_r + o_r)`, and `z_l` is greater than or equal to half of `(z_l + o_l)`, and `b_d` is greater than the absolute value of `n` divided by 2 minus `pos`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = pos` assigns the current value of `pos` to `ans`. This does not change the values of `i`, `z_l`, `o_l`, `o_r`, `z_r`, `b_d`, or `n`. Therefore, the conditions involving these variables remain unchanged.
