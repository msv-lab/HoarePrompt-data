Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `input_string` is the input received from the user, `t` is 1, `pos` is 0, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `o_r` is equal to `o`, `z_r` is equal to `z`, `ans` is 0. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to half of `(z_r + o_r)`, `dist` is assigned to `b_d`. Otherwise, `b_d` is set to 30001.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    pos += 1
    if i == 0:
        z_l += 1
        z_r -= 1
    else:
        o_l += 1
        o_r -= 1
    if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 
        2 - pos):
        ans = pos
        b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `arr` must contain at least one element; `pos` is increased by 1; if `i` is equal to 0, `z_r` is decreased by 1; otherwise, `o_l` is increased by 1 and `o_r` is decreased by 1; the current value of `o_r` is greater than or equal to half of the sum of `z_r` and `o_r`; the current value of `z_l` is greater than or equal to half of the sum of `z_l` and `o_l`; `b_d` is equal to the absolute difference between `n` divided by 2 and `pos`; `ans` is equal to `pos`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `pos` is increased by 2, and either `z_r` is decreased by 1 or `o_r` is decreased by 1 depending on whether `i` equals 0 or not. Additionally, if the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))` is true, then `ans` is set to `pos` and `b_d` remains as the absolute value of `n / 2 - pos`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `pos` is increased by 2, `ans` is equal to `pos`. If `i` equals 0, `z_r` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `o_l` is set to 1 and `o_r` is decreased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
