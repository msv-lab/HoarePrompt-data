Output State: **`pos` is increased by 2**

Explanation: The initial state indicates that `pos` is increased by 1. The code snippet increments `z_l` by 1. Since there is no direct relationship between `pos` and `z_l`, both variables are updated independently. Therefore, `pos` is increased by 1 (from its initial state) plus the additional 1 from the code snippet, making it increased by 2 in total.
