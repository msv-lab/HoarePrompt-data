Output State: **`arr` must contain at least one element; `pos` is increased by 1; if `i` is equal to 0, `z_r` is decreased by 1; otherwise, `o_l` is increased by 1 and `o_r` is decreased by 1; the current value of `o_r` is greater than or equal to half of the sum of `z_r` and `o_r`; the current value of `z_l` is greater than or equal to half of the sum of `z_l` and `o_l`; the current value of `b_d` is greater than the absolute difference between half of `n` and `pos`; `ans` is equal to `pos`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = pos` assigns the value of `pos` to `ans`. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged from the initial state.
