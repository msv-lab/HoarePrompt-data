Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `b_d`:**
   - The initial value of `b_d` is set to `30001`, which is an arbitrary large number but not necessary. Instead, you should initialize `b_d` to a value greater than any possible distance from `n/2`.

2. **Logic for Updating `ans` and `b_d`:**
   - The logic for updating `ans` and `b_d` inside the loop is flawed. It checks if the current position satisfies the conditions, but it should update `ans` and `b_d` only if the current position is better than the previous best position.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The code does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the entire village prefers one side or when the number of houses is odd.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        input_string = input()
        arr = [int(ch) for ch in input_string]
        z = arr.count(0)
        o = arr.count(1)
        z_r = z
        o_r = o
        z_l = 0
        o_l = 0
        (dist, ans, pos) = (math.inf, 0, 0)
        
        for i in range(n):
            if arr[i] == 0:
                z_l += 1
                z_r -= 1
            else:
                o_l += 1
                o_r -= 1
            
            if z_r >= (z_l + z_r) // 2 and o_r >= (o_l + o_r) // 2 and (abs(n / 2 - (i + 1)) < dist):
                ans = i + 1
                dist = abs(n / 2 - (i + 1))
        
        print(ans)
        t -= 1

func()
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Initialization of `dist` to `math.inf`:**
   - This ensures that any valid position will be considered initially.

2. **Proper Update Logic:**
   - The position `i + 1` is used to account for the 1-based indexing of positions.

3. **Simplified Conditions:**
   - The conditions for checking satisfaction are simplified using integer division (`//`).

This corrected version should now correctly find the optimal position for laying the road.
