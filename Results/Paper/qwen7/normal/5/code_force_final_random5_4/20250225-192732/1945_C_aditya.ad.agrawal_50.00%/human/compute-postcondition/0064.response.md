Output State: **`t` is 1, `pos` is equal to the length of `arr`, `z_l` is the total number of 0s in `arr`, `o_l` is the total number of 1s initially minus the total number of 1s encountered, `o_r` is the total number of 1s initially minus the total number of 1s encountered, `z_r` is the total number of 0s initially minus the total number of 0s encountered, `ans` is the position where the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d == abs(n / 2 - pos)` was last satisfied, `b_d` is equal to the absolute value of `n / 2 - pos` at the last iteration, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input to the variable `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
