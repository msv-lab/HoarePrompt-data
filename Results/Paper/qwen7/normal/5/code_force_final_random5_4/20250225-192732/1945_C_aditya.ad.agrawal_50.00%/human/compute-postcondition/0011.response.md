Output State: **`o_r` is equal to `o`, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 0**

Explanation: The code initializes three new variables `dist`, `ans`, and `pos` with the values `abs(n / 2)`, `0`, and `0` respectively. The values of `o_r`, `z_l`, and `o_l` remain unchanged from their initial state.
