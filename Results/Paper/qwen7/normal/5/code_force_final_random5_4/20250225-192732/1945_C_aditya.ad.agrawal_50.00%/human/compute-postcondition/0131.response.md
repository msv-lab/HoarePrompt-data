Output State: **`t` is a positive value, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is a string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers converted from each character in `input_string`, `z` is the count of 0s in the list `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in the list `arr`, `z_r` is equal to `z`, `o_r` is equal to `o`, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0**.

Explanation: The line `o_l = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `o_l`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `input_string`, `arr`, `z`, `o`, `z_r`, `o_r`, and `z_l` remain unchanged.
