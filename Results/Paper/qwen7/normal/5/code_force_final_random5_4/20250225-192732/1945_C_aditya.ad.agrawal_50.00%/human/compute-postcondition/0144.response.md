Output State: **`i` is the first element of `arr`; `pos` is 1; `o_r` is 0**

Explanation: The variable `o_r` is decremented by 1. Initially, `o_r` is 1, so after executing `o_r -= 1`, the value of `o_r` becomes 0. The values of `i`, `pos`, and `o_r` are updated, while the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
