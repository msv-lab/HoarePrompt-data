Output State: **`t` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 2⋅10^4, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is a string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a character from `input_string` converted to its ASCII value.**

The code creates a list `arr` where each element is the integer representation of a character from the string `input_string`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
