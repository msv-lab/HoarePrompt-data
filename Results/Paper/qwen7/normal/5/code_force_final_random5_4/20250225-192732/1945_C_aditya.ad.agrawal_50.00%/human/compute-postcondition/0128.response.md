Output State: **`t` is a positive value, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is a string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers converted from each character in `input_string`, `z` is the count of 0s in the list `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in the list `arr`, `z_r` is equal to `z`.**

Explanation: The code `z_r = z` assigns the value of `z` (which is the count of 0s in the list `arr`) to `z_r`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged.
