Output State: **`i` is an element of `arr`, `pos` is increased by 1, and `o_l` is increased by 1.**

The code `o_l += 1` increments the value of `o_l` by 1. Since `i` is an element of `arr` and `pos` is increased by 1, these conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still an element of `arr`, `pos` is still increased by 1, and `o_l` is now increased by 1.
