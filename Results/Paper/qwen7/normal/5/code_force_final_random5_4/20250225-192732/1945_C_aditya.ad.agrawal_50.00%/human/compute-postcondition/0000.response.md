Output State: **`t` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 2⋅10^4**.

The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, the input must adhere to this constraint. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
