Output State: **`t` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 2⋅10^4, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is a string input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a character from `input_string` converted to its ASCII value, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`**.

Explanation: The code counts the number of occurrences of the integer `0` in the list `arr` and assigns this count to the variable `z`. The values of `t`, `n`, `input_string`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
