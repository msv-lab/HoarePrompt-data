Output State: **`i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 3, `z_l` is either increased by 1 or unchanged, `o_l` is increased by 1, `o_r` is decreased by 1, `z_r` remains unchanged, `ans` is equal to `pos`, and the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2`, `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2`, and `b_d == abs(n / 2 - pos)` are still true.**

Explanation: The code `o_r -= 1` decreases the value of `o_r` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. The conditions mentioned are still true as no changes were made to the variables involved in these conditions.
