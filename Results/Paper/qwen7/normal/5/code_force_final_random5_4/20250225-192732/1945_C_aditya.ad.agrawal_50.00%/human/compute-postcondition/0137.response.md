Output State: **`i` is the first element of `arr`; `pos` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `pos` is incremented by 1. Initially, `pos` is equal to the index of `i` (which is the first element of `arr`). Since `i` is the first element of `arr`, `pos` was initially 0. After executing `pos += 1`, `pos` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
