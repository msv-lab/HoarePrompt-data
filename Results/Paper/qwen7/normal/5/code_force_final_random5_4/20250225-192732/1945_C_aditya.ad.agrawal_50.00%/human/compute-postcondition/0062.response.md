`t` is decremented by 1, but the exact value of `t` before this operation is not specified. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is decreased by 1; `pos` is equal to the length of `arr`; `z_l` is the total number of 0s in `arr`; `o_l` is the total number of 1s initially minus the total number of 1s encountered; `o_r` is the total number of 1s initially minus the total number of 1s encountered; `z_r` is the total number of 0s initially minus the total number of 0s encountered; `ans` is the position where the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d == abs(n / 2 - pos)` was last satisfied; `b_d` is equal to the absolute value of `n / 2 - pos` at the last iteration.
