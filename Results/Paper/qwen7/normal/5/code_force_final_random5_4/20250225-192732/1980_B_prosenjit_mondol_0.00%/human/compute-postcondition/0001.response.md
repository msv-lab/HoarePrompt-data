Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

The code `n, f, k = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `f`, and `k`. Since the input values are not specified in the initial state, the variables `n`, `f`, and `k` are left as "an input integer" each. All other variables remain in their initial state, which is not specified here but can be assumed to be unchanged unless otherwise stated.
