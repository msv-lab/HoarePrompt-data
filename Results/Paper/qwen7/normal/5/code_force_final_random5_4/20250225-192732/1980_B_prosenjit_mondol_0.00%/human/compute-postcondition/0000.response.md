Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only object here is the result of `int(input())`, which we'll call `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `t`**: The problem statement tells us that `t` is a positive integer such that `1 <= t <= 1000`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is a positive integer. Since `t` is read from user input, we cannot guarantee its value without the actual input.

4. **Adjust the state**: To ensure the loop can execute, we need to make sure that `t` is a positive integer within the specified range. Therefore, we need to adjust `t` to be a valid positive integer.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` being a positive integer within the range `1 <= t <= 1000`.

**State:**
**`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000**
