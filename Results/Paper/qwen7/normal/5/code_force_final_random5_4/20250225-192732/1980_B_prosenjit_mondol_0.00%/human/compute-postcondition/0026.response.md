Output: **YES**

Explanation:
- `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order.
- `x` is the element at index `f-1` in list `a`. Since the index is `f-1`, it refers to the second last element in the list `a`.
- `n` is the input integer from the first split. This value is not used in the print statement.
- `k` is the input integer decreased by 2. This value is also not used in the print statement.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`, regardless of the values of `a`, `x`, `n`, and `k`. Therefore, the output is **YES**.
