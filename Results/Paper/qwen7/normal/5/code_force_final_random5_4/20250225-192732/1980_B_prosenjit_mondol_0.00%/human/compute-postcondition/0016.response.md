Postcondition: `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer decreased by 1, `x` is the element at index `f` in list `a`. After the execution of the if-else block, the value of `a[k]` remains unchanged regardless of whether `a[k]` is greater than or equal to `x` or less than `x`.
