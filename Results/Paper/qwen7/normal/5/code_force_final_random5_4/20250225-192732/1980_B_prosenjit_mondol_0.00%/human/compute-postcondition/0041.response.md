Postcondition: **`a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order, `x` is the element at index `f-1` in list `a`, `n` is the integer from the first split, `f` is `f` decreased by 1, `k` is the integer from the first split decreased by 3. Since both the if and else parts do not change the values of these variables, the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition.**
