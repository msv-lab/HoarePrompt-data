Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the favorite cube is exactly at the `k`-th position after sorting but the next cube (at position `k-1`) has the same value as the favorite cube. This can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5 5 2
5 2 4 1 3
```
- The original array is `[5, 2, 4, 1, 3]`.
- After sorting in non-increasing order, it becomes `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.
- The favorite cube is the last one (`5`), and `k = 2`.
- The first two cubes after sorting are `[5, 4]`.
- Since `5` is greater than `4`, the program prints `NO`, which is incorrect because the favorite cube should be removed.

The program should check if the value of the `k`-th cube is less than the value of the favorite cube (`x`). If equal, it should further check if the `(k-1)`-th cube is less than `x` to decide whether the favorite cube is removed or not.
