Postcondition: `i`, `j`, `ans`, `k`, `t1`, and `t2` are as follows: 
- If `t2 > t1`, then `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `ans` is max(`t1`, `t2`) + max(`t1`, `t2`), `k` is 2, `t1` is `abs(a[1] - c[1])`, and `t2` is `abs(a[2] - c[0])`.
- Otherwise, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `ans` is max(`t1`, `t2`) + max(`t1`, `t2`), `k` is 2, `t1` is `abs(a[1] - c[1])`, and `t2` is `abs(a[2] - c[0])`.
