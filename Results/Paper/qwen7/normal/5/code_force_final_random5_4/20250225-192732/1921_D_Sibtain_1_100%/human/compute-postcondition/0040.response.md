Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 3, `ans` is max(`t1`, `t2`) + max(`t1`, `t2`), `k` is 2, `t1` is `abs(a[1] - c[1])`, `t2` is `abs(a[2] - c[0])`**

Explanation: The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Initially, `j` is 2, so after executing the code, `j` becomes 3. The values of the other variables (`i`, `ans`, `k`, `t1`, and `t2`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
