Output State: **`k` is 0, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`, `j` is increased by 1.**

The value of `j` is incremented by 1, while the values of `k`, `t1`, and `t2` remain unchanged from their initial states.
