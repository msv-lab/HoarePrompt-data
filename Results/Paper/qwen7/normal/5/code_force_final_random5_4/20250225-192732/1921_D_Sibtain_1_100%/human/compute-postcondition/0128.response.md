Output State: `k` is equal to `len(a)`, `i` is equal to the last index where `t1` was updated, `j` is equal to the last index where `t2` was updated, `ans` is the sum of `max(t1, t2)` for each iteration of the loop from `k=0` to `k=len(a)-1`.

In this final state, `k` will have reached the length of list `a`, meaning the loop has completed all its iterations. The value of `ans` will be the cumulative maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration, reflecting the logic of adding the maximum of the two absolute differences in each step. The values of `i` and `j` will reflect the last positions they were incremented to during the loop's execution, based on the conditions provided within the loop body.
