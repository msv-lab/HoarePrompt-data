Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 1, `ans` is 0, `a` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `k` is 0, `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]` (where `i` is 0), and assigns the result to `t1`. Since `i` is 0, `t1` becomes `abs(a[0] - c[0])`. The values of `j`, `ans`, `a`, and `k` remain unchanged.
