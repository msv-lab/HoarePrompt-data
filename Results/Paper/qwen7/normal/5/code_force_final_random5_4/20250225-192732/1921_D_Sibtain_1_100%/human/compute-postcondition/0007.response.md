The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. All the variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input, `m` is an integer obtained from the second input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the third input split by spaces, `c` is a list of integers obtained from the fourth input split by spaces. The set of elements in `a` contains only one unique element, the set of elements in `c` contains only one unique element, and the first element of `a` is equal to the first element of `c`.**
