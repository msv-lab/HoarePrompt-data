Output State: **`i` is 0; `j` is 2; `ans` is 0; `a` is a list that must have at least 1 element; `k` is 0; `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`; `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[len(c) - 1])`**.

The value of `j` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
