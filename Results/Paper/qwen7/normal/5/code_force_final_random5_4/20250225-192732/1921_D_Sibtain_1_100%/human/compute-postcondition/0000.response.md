Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved here is the placeholder `_`, which is used as a dummy variable to iterate over the range returned by `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - The loop will execute based on the value of `int(input())`.
   - We need to ensure that `int(input())` returns a valid number of iterations.

3. **Initial State Before the Loop:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - For each test case, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\).
   - `a_i` and `b_i` are integers such that \(1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(i\).

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since the loop will run based on the input, we need to ensure that the input value (which determines the number of iterations) is within the expected range.
   - The initial state of `t` being a positive integer between 1 and 100 ensures that the loop can potentially run up to 100 times.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the input value, which should be a valid positive integer.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\)**.
