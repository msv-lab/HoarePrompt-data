Output State: **i is either 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, ..., len(a)-1; j is either 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, ..., len(c); ans is the sum of max(t1, t2) for each iteration; k is len(a); t1 is abs(a[i] - c[i]); t2 is abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j]); n is an input integer; m is an input integer; a is a sorted list of integers created from user input; c is a list of integers created from user input sorted in descending order; and len(a) must be at least 4.**

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- `i` will take on all possible values from 0 to `len(a) - 1`.
- `j` will take on all possible values from 1 to `len(c)`.
- `ans` will be the cumulative sum of the maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration of the loop.
- `k` will be equal to `len(a)`.
- `t1` will be the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]` for the final value of `i`.
- `t2` will be the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]` for the final value of `j`.
- The lengths and contents of lists `a` and `c` will remain as initially defined by the user inputs, with `a` being sorted and `c` being sorted in descending order.
