Postcondition: `i`, `j`, `ans`, `k`, `t1`, and `t2` retain their initial values. If `t2 > t1`, then `i` becomes 1 and `j` becomes 3. Otherwise, `i` remains 2 and `j` remains 2. The value of `ans` remains as `max(t1, t2) + max(t1, t2)`, `k` remains 2, `t1` remains `abs(a[1] - c[1])`, and `t2` remains `abs(a[2] - c[0])`.
