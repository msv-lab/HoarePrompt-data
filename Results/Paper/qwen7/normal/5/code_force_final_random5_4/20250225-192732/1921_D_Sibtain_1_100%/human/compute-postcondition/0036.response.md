Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 2, `ans` is max(`t1`, `t2`) + max(`t1`, `t2`), `k` is 1, `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`, and `t2` is `abs(a[2] - c[2])**.

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by adding `max(t1, t2)` to its current value. Since `ans` was initially `max(t1, t2)`, after executing `ans += max(t1, t2)`, `ans` becomes `max(t1, t2) + max(t1, t2)`, which simplifies to `2 * max(t1, t2)`. The values of `i`, `j`, `k`, `t1`, and `t2` remain unchanged from their initial states.
