Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 2, `ans` is max(t1, t2), `k` is 0, `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`, and `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[len(c) - 1])**.

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by adding the maximum of `t1` and `t2` to it. Since `t2` is not greater than `t1`, `i` remains 0 and `j` remains 2. The value of `t2` remains unchanged, and `ans` is updated to be the maximum of `t1` and `t2`. All other variables retain their original values.
