Output State: **`i` is either 0, 1, 1, or 2; `j` is either 1, 2, 2, or 3; `ans` is `max(t1, t2)` + `max(abs(a[i] - c[i]), abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j]))` + `max(t1, t2)`, `k` is 5; `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`; `t2` is updated to `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`; `n` is an input integer; `m` is an input integer; `a` is a sorted list of integers created from user input; `c` is a list of integers created from user input sorted in descending order; and `len(a)` must be at least 4.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by adding `max(t1, t2)` to its current value. Since `t1` and `t2` are already defined as `abs(a[i] - c[i])` and `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])` respectively, `ans` now includes this additional term. All other variables remain unchanged.
