Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 2, `ans` is max(t1, t2), `k` is 1, `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`, `t2` is `abs(a[2] - c[2])`**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` is 0, so after executing the code, `i` becomes 1. The values of `j`, `ans`, `k`, `t1`, and `t2` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the given code snippet.
