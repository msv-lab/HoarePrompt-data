Output State: **`k` is 2, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`, `ans` is `max(abs(a[i] - c[i]), t2) + max(t1, t2) + max(t1, t2)`, and either `j` is increased by 1 if `t2 > t1`, or `i` is increased by 1 if `t2 <= t1`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += max(t1, t2)` adds the maximum of `t1` and `t2` to `ans`. The values of `k`, `t1`, `t2`, and the conditions for incrementing `i` or `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, `k` remains 2, `t1` and `t2` retain their original definitions, and `ans` is updated to include the additional value of `max(t1, t2)`. The condition for incrementing `i` or `j` also remains the same.
