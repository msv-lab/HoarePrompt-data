Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is the length of string `a`
   - Either:
     - `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, in which case `match_a_b` is set to `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
     - The character at index `i` of `template` is not lowercase. Additionally, either the character at index `i` of `a` is equal to the character at index `i` of `template` after lowercasing, or the character at index `i` of `b` is equal to the character at index `template` after lowercasing, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Loop Head**: The loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`.
   - The loop condition is `i < n`, where `n` is the length of string `a`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 1 in the next iteration.
   - `n` remains the same, which is the length of string `a`.

5. **Postconditions for Next Iteration**:
   - The postcondition for the next iteration should reflect the new value of `i` (which is now 1).
   - The conditions involving `a[i]`, `b[i]`, and `template[i]` will be checked again for `i = 1`.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is the length of string `a`**.
