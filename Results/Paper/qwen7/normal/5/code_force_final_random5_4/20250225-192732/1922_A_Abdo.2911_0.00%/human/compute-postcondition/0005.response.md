Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input by the user without leading or trailing spaces, `b` is the string input by the user without leading or trailing spaces, `c` is the string input by the user without leading or trailing spaces.**

The code `c = input().strip()` reads a string input from the user and strips any leading or trailing whitespace. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The new variable `c` is assigned the stripped input string.
