Output State: **`match_a_b` is `False`, `match_c` is `False`, `n` is an input integer**

The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, updating the value of `n`. The values of `match_a_b` and `match_c` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the input operation.
