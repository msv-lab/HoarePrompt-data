Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input by the user without leading or trailing spaces**.

The code `a = input().strip()` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `a`. The `.strip()` method removes any leading and trailing whitespace from the input string. The conditions for `t` and the type of `n` remain unchanged.
