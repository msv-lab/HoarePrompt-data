Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input().strip()
    b = input().strip()
    c = input().strip()
    template = []
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == b[i]:
            template.append(a[i])
        else:
            template.append(a[i].upper())
    match_a_b = True
    for i in range(n):
        if template[i].islower():
            if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
                match_a_b = False
                break
        elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i
            ].lower():
            match_a_b = False
            break
    match_c = True
    for i in range(n):
        if template[i].islower():
            if c[i] != template[i]:
                match_c = False
                break
        elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
            match_c = False
            break
    if match_a_b and not match_c:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `match_a_b` is `False`, `match_c` is `False`, and `n` is the length of string `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `4 * n`, `match_c` remains `False`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited regardless of the values of `template[i]` or `c[i]`. Additionally, `match_a_b` is `True` if the if condition is met, otherwise, `match_a_b` is `False`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `match_c` is either False or True, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than 3. If `match_a_b` is True and `match_c` is False, then the function does not change the values of `match_c`, `i`, and `n`. If `match_a_b` is True and `match_c` is also True, then the function does not change the values of `match_c`, `i`, and `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
