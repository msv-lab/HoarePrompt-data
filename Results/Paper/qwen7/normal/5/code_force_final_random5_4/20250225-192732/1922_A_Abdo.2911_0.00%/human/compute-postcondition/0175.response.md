Output State: **`i` is `2 * n + (n - 1)`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `match_a_b` is `False`, `match_c` is `True`**.

Natural Language Explanation: The variable `i` is set to `2 * n + (n - 1)`, which simplifies to `3 * n - 1`. This value is derived from the loop that increments `i` by 1 for each iteration from `0` to `n-1`, starting from `2 * n - 1`. The condition that `n` must be greater than 0 ensures the loop runs at least once. The variable `match_a_b` remains `False` after the third iteration and no changes are made to it afterward. Additionally, the variable `match_c` is explicitly set to `True` outside the loop, so it retains this value after the loop has completed.
