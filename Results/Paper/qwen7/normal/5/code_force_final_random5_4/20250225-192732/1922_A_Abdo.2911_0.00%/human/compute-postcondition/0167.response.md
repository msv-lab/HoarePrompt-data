Output State: **`i` is `2 * n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `match_a_b` is False**

Explanation: The line `match_a_b = False` assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `match_a_b`. This does not affect the values of `i` or `n`. The initial conditions that `i` is `2 * n + 1` and `n` must be greater than 1 remain unchanged.
