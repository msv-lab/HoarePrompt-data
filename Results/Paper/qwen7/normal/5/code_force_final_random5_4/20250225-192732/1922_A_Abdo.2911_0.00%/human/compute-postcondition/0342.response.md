Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( t \) (number of test cases, 1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 1000), an integer \( n \) (length of strings, 1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 20), and three strings \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) (each of length \( n \) and containing only lowercase Latin letters). For each test case, it constructs a template string based on the comparison of \( a \) and \( b \), checks if \( a \) and \( b \) match according to the template, and then checks if \( c \) matches the template. If \( a \) and \( b \) match but \( c \) does not, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.**
