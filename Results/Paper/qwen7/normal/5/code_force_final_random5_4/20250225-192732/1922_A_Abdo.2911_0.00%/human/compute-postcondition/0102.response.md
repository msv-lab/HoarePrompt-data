Based on the initial state provided:

- `match_a_b` is `False`
- `match_c` is `False`
- `n` is the length of string `a`
- The condition `(match_a_b and (not match_c))` is true.

Let's break down the condition:
- `match_a_b` is `False`
- `not match_c` evaluates to `True` because `match_c` is `False`

Therefore, the condition `(match_a_b and (not match_c))` simplifies to `False and True`, which is `False`.

However, the `print('YES')` statement is executed regardless of the condition. The condition only affects whether certain logic might run, but it does not change the fact that the `print` statement itself will execute and print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
