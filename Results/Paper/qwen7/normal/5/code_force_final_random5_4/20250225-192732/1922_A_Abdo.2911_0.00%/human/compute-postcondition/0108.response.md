Output State: **`match_a_b` is `False`, `match_c` is `False`, `a` is an input string**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the input (stripped of leading/trailing whitespace) to the variable `a`. The variables `match_a_b` and `match_c` remain unchanged from their initial state, and `n` remains an input integer.
