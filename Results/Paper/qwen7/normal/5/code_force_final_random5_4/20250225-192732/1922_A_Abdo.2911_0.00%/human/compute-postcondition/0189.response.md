Output State: **`match_c` is `False`, `i` is `2 * n + (n - 1)`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter, and the current value of `c[i].lower()` is equal to the current value of `template[i].lower()`**.

Explanation: The line `match_c = False` assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `match_c`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `template`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states.
