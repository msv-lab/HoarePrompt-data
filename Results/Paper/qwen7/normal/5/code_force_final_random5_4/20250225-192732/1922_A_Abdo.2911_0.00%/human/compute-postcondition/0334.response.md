Based on the initial state provided:

- `match_c` is either `False` or `True`.
- `i` is `3`.
- `n` is greater than `3`.
- The condition `match_a_b` is `True` while `match_c` is `False`.

The print statement is simply:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `match_c`, `i`, `n`, and `match_a_b`.

Output: **YES**
