Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is `2 * n + (n - 1)`
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - The condition for breaking out of the loop or if statement is based on the character at index `i` in `template`.

2. **Loop Head**:
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop iterates over `range(n)`.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `2 * n + (n - 1)`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `2 * n + (n - 1) + 1 = 3 * n - 1`.

4. **Condition for Loop Continuation**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `range(n)`, the only variable that changes within the loop is `i`.
   - `n` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
   - The state of `template` and `match_c` does not change based on the loop itself; they are modified within the loop body but not directly by the loop increment.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop is `i`.

**Final State**:
- `i` is `3 * n - 1`
- `n` must be greater than 0

So, the final state is:
State: **`i` is `3 * n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 0**
