Output State: **`i` is `2 * n + (n - 1)`, `n` must be greater than 0, and the character at index `i` in `template` is not a lowercase letter; `match_c` is `False`**.

Explanation: The code simply assigns `False` to the variable `match_c`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, or the condition on the character in `template`. Therefore, these conditions remain unchanged, and `match_c` is now explicitly set to `False`.
