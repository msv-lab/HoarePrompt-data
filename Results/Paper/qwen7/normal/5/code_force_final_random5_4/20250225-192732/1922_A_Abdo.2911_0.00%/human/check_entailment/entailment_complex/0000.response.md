Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. It reads the length of the strings (`n`) and the three strings (`a`, `b`, `c`) as specified.

2. **Template Construction**: For each test case, the program constructs a template string based on the characters in `a` and `b`. Specifically, if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, the template uses `a[i]` (or `b[i]`). If they differ, the template uses the uppercase version of `a[i]` (or `b[i]`).

3. **Matching Conditions**:
   - It checks if both `a` and `b` match the constructed template.
   - It also checks if `c` does not match the template.

4. **Output Determination**: Based on the results of the matching conditions, the program prints 'YES' if `a` and `b` match the template but `c` does not, and 'NO' otherwise.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement. It ensures that the conditions for matching and non-matching are correctly applied.

Given the above analysis, the annotated program accurately implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
