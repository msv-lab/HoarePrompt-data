Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `match_a_b` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block immediately surrounding the `break` statement, it indicates that we are breaking out of the most internal loop or conditional that was active before this line of code. The values of `i`, `n`, and `match_a_b` remain unchanged.
