Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is the length of string `a`, and the character at index `i` of `template` is not lowercase. Additionally, either the character at index `i` of `a` is equal to the character at index `i` of `template` when both are converted to lowercase, or the character at index `i` of `b` is equal to the character at index `i` of `template` when both are converted to lowercase.
