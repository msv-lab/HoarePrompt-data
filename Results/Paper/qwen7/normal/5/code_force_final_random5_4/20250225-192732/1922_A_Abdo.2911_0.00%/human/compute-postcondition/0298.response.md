Output State: **`match_c` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 3, and the current value of `template[i]` is a lowercase character, the current value of `c[i]` is not equal to the current value of `template[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This output state indicates that the `break` statement has been executed, which means we have exited the innermost loop or conditional block without changing the values of `match_c`, `i`, `n`, `template[i]`, and `c[i]`.
