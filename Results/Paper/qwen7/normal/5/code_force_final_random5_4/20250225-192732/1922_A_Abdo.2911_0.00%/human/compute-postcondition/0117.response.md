Postcondition: `match_a_b` is False, `match_c` is False, `c` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `template` is either a list containing the value of `a[i]` (if `a[i]` equals `b[i]`) or a list containing the uppercase value of `a[i]` (if `a[i]` does not equal `b[i]`), `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 0.
