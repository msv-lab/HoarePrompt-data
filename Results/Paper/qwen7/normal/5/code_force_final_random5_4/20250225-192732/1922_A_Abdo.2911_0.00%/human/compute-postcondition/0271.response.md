Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `match_a_b` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block immediately preceding the `break` statement in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `n`, or `match_a_b`. It simply indicates that we would exit the nearest enclosing loop or conditional structure. However, since no such structure exists before the `break` statement, the variables retain their initial states.
