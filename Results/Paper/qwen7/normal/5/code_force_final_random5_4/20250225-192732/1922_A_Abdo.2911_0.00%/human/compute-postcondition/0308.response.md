Postcondition: `match_c` is True, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 3, and the current value of `template[i]` is a lowercase character. If the current value of `c[i]` is not equal to the lowercase version of `template[i]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the lowercase versions are equal, we break out of the loop. If the lowercase versions are not equal, no change is made to `match_c`, `i`, `n`, and `template[i]` remains unchanged.
