Output State: **`i` is `3 * n`, `match_c` is `False`**.

Explanation: The line `match_c = False` simply assigns the value `False` to the variable `match_c`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was initially set to `3 * n`. The most internal loop or if statement is exited, but this does not affect the values of `i` or `match_c`.
