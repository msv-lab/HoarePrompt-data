Output State: **`match_c` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 3, and `template[i]` is not a lowercase character, and the lowercase version of `c[i]` is equal to the lowercase version of `template[i]`.**

Explanation: The variable `match_c` is explicitly set to `False`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `template[i]`, and the lowercase comparison) remain unchanged from their initial states.
