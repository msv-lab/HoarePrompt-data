Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to `2 * n + (n - 1)`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `match_a_b` and `match_c` are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution.

3. **Check if the loop can execute based on the given initial state**:
   - For the loop `for i in range(n)` to execute, `n` must be at least 1 (since `range(n)` includes numbers from 0 to `n-1`).
   - The value of `i` (`2 * n + (n - 1)`) is irrelevant to the loop's execution condition because the loop starts with `i=0` and increments `i` within the loop.

4. **Adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute**:
   - Since `n` must be greater than 0, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1.
   - We do not need to change the value of `i` because the loop will start with `i=0` and increment `i` within the loop.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `2 * n + (n - 1)`, `n` must be greater than 0**
