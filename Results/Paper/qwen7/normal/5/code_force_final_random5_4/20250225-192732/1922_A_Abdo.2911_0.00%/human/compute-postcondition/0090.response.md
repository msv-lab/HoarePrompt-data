Output State: **`match_a_b` is False, `match_c` is False, `n` is greater than 0, and `template[i+2]` is not a lowercase character.**

The `break` statement does not change any variable values but instead breaks out of the current loop or conditional block. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement, their previous states remain unchanged.
