Output State: **`i` is `4 * n`, `match_c` remains `False`, `match_a_b` is `True` if the if condition is met, otherwise `match_a_b` is `False`, `t` is reduced by 1, `a` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `c` is the input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace.**

Explanation: The code `c = input().strip()` reads an input string from the user, strips it of leading and trailing whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `c`. The other variables (`i`, `match_c`, `match_a_b`, `t`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
