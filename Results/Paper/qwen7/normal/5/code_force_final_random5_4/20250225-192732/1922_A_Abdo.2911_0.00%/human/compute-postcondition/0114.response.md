Output State: **`match_a_b` is False, `match_c` is False, `c` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `template` is a list containing the value of `a[i]`, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0, and the current value of `a[i]` is equal to the current value of `b[i]`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a[i]` to the `template` list. Since `i` was initially 0, after appending, `i` is incremented to 1. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
