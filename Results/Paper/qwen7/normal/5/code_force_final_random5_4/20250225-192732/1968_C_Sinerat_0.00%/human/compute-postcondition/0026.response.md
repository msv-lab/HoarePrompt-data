Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `n` (which is the final value it reaches after all iterations), `a[1]` is `a[0] + x[0]`, `a[2]` is `a[1] + x[1]`, ..., `a[n-1]` is `a[n-2] + x[n-2]`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, meaning the loop has completed all its iterations. The list `a` will have been updated such that each element `a[i]` (from index 1 to `n-1`) is the cumulative sum of `a[0]` and all elements in the list `x` up to index `i-1`. The initial value of `a[0]` remains 500, and the rest of the variables' states remain as described in the initial and intermediate states.
