Output State: **`_` is `int(input()) - 1`, `n` is `int(input())`, `x` is a list of integers split from the input string.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual integers, and converts each integer to an int using the map function. The resulting list of integers is assigned to the variable `x`. The values of `_` and `n` are updated to the next two integers entered by the user. The initial values of `_` and `n` are no longer directly relevant, but their updated values are included in the output state.
