Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list of `n` zeros, `a[0]` is 500.**

Explanation: The code sets the first element of the list `a` (i.e., `a[0]`) to 500. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, and the rest of the elements in `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
