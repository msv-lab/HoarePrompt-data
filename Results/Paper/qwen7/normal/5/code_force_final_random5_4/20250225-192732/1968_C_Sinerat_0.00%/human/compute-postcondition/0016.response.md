Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer, `a[i]` is the sum of `a[0]` and all elements in the list `x` up to index `n-1`, `x` is a list of integers created from input.**

Explanation: The code `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to a string, and then maps them to integers, storing the resulting list in `x`. The initial state of `i` being equal to `n` and `a[i]` being the sum of `a[0]` and all elements in the list `x` up to index `n-1` remains unchanged. Therefore, `x` is updated to the list of integers obtained from the input, while `i` and `a[i]` retain their original relationship.
