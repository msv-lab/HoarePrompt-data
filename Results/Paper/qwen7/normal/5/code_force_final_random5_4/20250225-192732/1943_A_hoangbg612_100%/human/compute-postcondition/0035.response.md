Output State: **`cur` is `num`, `T` is an input integer, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of sorted integers, `M` is a dictionary with key `cur` and value 1.**

Explanation: The code `M[cur] = 1` updates the dictionary `M` by setting the value of the key `cur` to 1. The other variables (`T`, `S`, `N`) remain unchanged. The initial value of `cur` is `num`, so the dictionary `M` now contains the key `num` with the value 1.
