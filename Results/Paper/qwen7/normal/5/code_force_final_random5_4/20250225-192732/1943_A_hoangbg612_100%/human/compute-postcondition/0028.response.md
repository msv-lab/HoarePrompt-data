Postcondition: **`cur` is the next element in the list `N` if it was not -1, `T` is an input integer, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of sorted integers that must have at least one element, `M` is a dictionary with key `cur` and value 1 if `num > cur`, otherwise `M` is a dictionary with key `-1` and value 1. If `num > cur`, then `cur` becomes `num`.**
