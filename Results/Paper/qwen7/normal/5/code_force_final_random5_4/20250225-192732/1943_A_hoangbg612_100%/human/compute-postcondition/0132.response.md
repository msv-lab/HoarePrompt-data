Output State: **`cnt` is a list containing all keys from the dictionary `M` where the corresponding value in `M` is 1, `cur` is -1, `S` is an input integer, `T` must be greater than 0, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from the input split into spaces.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns `-1` to the variable `cur`. The values of `cnt`, `S`, `T`, and `N` remain unchanged from their initial states.
