Output State: **`num` is the next value from `N`, `cur` is equal to `num`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If the condition `num > cur + 1` is not met, the postcondition remains as the initial state where `num` is the next value from `N` and `cur` and `M` remain as they were updated in the previous iteration.**

This means that the current value of `cur` is now equal to the value of `num`, and the conditions for breaking out of the loop or if statement based on the comparison between `num` and `cur + 1` are checked. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, the loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the initial state conditions continue to hold.
