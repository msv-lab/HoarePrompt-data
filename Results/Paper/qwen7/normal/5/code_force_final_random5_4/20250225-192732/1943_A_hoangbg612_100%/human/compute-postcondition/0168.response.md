Output State: **After all iterations, the variable `cur` will be equal to the last element of `N`, and `M` will be a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `N` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears consecutively in the list `N`. If two consecutive numbers in `N` are the same, their counts are added together in the dictionary `M`.**

This means that after the loop has executed for all elements in `N`, `cur` will hold the last number processed, and `M` will contain the frequency of each number in `N` as it appeared consecutively.
