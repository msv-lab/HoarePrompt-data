Postcondition: `num` is the next value from `N`, `cur` and `M` remain as they were updated in the previous iteration. If `num` is greater than `cur`, then `M[cur]` is set to 1, `num` is the next value from `N`, `cur` is equal to `num`, and either the most internal loop or if statement is broken if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. Otherwise, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.
