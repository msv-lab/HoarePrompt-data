Postcondition: **`cur` is either equal to `num` or -1, `T` is an input integer, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of sorted integers that must have at least one element, `M` is a dictionary with key `cur` and value `1` if `num > cur`, otherwise `M` is a dictionary with key `-1` and value `1`. Additionally, if `num > cur + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
