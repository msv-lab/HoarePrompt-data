Output State: `cur` is the last element in the list `N`, `T` is an input integer, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of sorted integers, `M` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `N` that was greater than `cur` at some point during the loop, and the value for each such key is `1`. If no elements in `N` were greater than `cur`, then `M[-1]` will be `1`, and `cur` will remain `-1`. All other keys in `M` will have a value of `0` or `2` based on how many times they were incremented.

This output state describes the final conditions after the loop has completed all its iterations. The `cur` variable will be updated to the highest value in `N` that satisfied the condition `num > cur`, or remain `-1` if no such value existed. The dictionary `M` will contain counts of how many times each relevant element in `N` was encountered as `cur`.
