Postcondition: `cur` is the next element in the list `N`, `T` is an input integer, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of sorted integers that must have at least one element, `M` is a dictionary with key `cur` and value 1. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `num` is not greater than `cur + 1`, no changes occur.
