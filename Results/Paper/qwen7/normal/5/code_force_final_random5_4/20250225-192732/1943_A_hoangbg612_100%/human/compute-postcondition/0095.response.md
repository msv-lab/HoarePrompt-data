Output State: **`cur` is increased by 1, `num` is the next value from `N`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where `cur` is being increased by 1 and `num` is getting the next value from `N`. The value of `M` remains unchanged as it was updated in the previous iteration, and the other variables are not affected by the `break` statement.
