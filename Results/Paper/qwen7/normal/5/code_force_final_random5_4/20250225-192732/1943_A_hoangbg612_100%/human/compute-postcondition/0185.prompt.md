Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cnt` is an empty list, `cur` is equal to the last element of `N`, and `M` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `N` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears consecutively in the list `N`. Additionally, if the sum of all values in the dictionary `M` equals `S`, then `cur` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for k in M.keys():
    if M[k] == 1:
        cnt.append(k)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `M` must have at least one key. If `M[k]` is 1, then `cnt` is a list containing the value of `k`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `M` must have at least one key, and `k` is the next key in the dictionary `M`. If `M[k]` equals 1, then `cnt` is a list containing the key `k`. If `M[k]` does not equal 1, then `cnt` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `M` must have at least one key, and `k` is the next key in the dictionary `M`. If `M[k]` equals 1, then `cnt` is a list containing the key `k`. If `M[k]` does not equal 1, then `cnt` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
