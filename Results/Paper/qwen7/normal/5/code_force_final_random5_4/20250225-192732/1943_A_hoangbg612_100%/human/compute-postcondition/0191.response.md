Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `cur` will be set to the second smallest unique number that appeared in any of the lists `N` across all iterations if such a number exists. If there is no such unique number (i.e., all numbers either appear more than once or there are fewer than two unique numbers), `cur` will remain unchanged from its final value after the third iteration.

This means that `cur` will reflect the second smallest distinct number seen in the lists `N` provided as inputs to each iteration of the loop, ensuring it has been incremented appropriately based on the conditions within the loop.
