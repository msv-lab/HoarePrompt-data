Output State: **`cnt` is a list containing all keys from the dictionary `M` where the corresponding value in `M` is 1, if the length of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, then `cur` is equal to the second element of `cnt`, `cur` remains unchanged if the length of `cnt` is less than 2, `S` is an input integer, `T` must be greater than 0, `N` is a list of integers obtained from the input split into spaces.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer using `map(int, input().split())`. This results in a list of integers, which is assigned to the variable `N`. The values of `cnt`, `cur`, `S`, and `T` remain unchanged from their initial states.
