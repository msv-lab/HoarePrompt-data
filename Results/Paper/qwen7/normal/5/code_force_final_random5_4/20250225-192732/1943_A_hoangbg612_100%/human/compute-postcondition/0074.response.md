Output State: **`cur` is an integer greater than `num` by less than 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `cur` or `num`. It only causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently inside. Since no new assignments or operations are performed on `cur` or `num`, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
