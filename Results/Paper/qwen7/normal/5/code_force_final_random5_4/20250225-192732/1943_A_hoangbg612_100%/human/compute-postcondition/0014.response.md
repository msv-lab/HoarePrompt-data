Output State: **`cur` is now equal to `num`, `T` is an input integer, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of sorted integers that must have at least one element, `M` is an empty dictionary, and if `num > cur + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code `cur = num` simply assigns the value of `num` to `cur`. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition `if num > cur + 1` is still applicable, though it hasn't been evaluated yet since `cur` is now equal to `num`.
