Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than `m`. If `a[i]` is in `b_freq`, then `matches` is reduced by `min(window_freq[a[i]], b_freq[a[i]])`, and if the number of matches is greater than or equal to `k`, then `good_subarrays` is 1. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `n`, and `m` remain as they were initially.
