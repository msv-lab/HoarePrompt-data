Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` must be greater than `m`; `good_subarrays` is 1 if the number of matches is greater than or equal to `k` after reducing `window_freq[a[i]]` by 1 and checking if `a[i]` is in `b_freq`. Otherwise, `window_freq[a[i]]` is reduced by 1.**

Explanation: The code decrements the value of `window_freq[a[i]]` by 1. The values of `i`, `n`, `m`, `good_subarrays`, and `b_freq` remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition for `good_subarrays` remains the same, just with the updated value of `window_freq[a[i]]`.
