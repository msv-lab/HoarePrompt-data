Output State: **`num_tests` is a positive integer such that 1 <= num_tests <= 1000, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing integers from 1 to 16777216, `idx` is 24.**

Explanation: The original value of `idx` was 25. After executing the line `idx -= 1`, the value of `idx` is decremented by 1, resulting in `idx` being 24. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `idx` being 24 while keeping the other variables in their original conditions.
