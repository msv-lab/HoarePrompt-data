Output State: **`num_tests` is a positive integer such that 1 <= num_tests <= 1000, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing integers from 1 to 16777216 with an additional element `k - nums[24]`, `idx` is 24**.

Explanation: The code appends the value `k - nums[idx]` to the list `nums`. Since `idx` is 24, the new element added to `nums` is `k - nums[24]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
