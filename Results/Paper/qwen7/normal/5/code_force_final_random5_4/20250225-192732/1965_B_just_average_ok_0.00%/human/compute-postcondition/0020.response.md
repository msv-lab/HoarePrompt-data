Output State: **`num_tests` is a positive integer such that 0 < num_tests <= 999, `n` is the integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing integers from 1 to 16777216 with an additional element `k - nums[24]` and now includes `k + 1`, `idx` is 24.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that `n` is assigned the value of the first integer entered, and `k` is assigned the value of the second integer entered. The other variables (`num_tests`, `nums`, and `idx`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
