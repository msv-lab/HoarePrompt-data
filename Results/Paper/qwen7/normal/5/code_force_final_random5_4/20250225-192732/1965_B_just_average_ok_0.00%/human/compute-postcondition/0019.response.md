Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for _ in range(int(input())):` statement. This means the loop will iterate based on the value of `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `num_tests` is a positive integer such that 1 <= num_tests <= 1000.
   - `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split.
   - `k` is at least 16777216.
   - `nums` is a list containing integers from 1 to 16777216 with an additional element `k - nums[24]` and now includes `k + 1`.
   - `idx` is 24.
   - `nums` is updated to exclude `1 << idx`.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue if `int(input())` is greater than 0.
   - Since we don't know the exact value of the next input, we can only assume it will be a positive integer (as per the loop condition).

Given these points, the only variable that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is the input itself, which will determine how many times the loop runs.

4. **Update the state**:
   - `num_tests` will be decremented by 1 since one iteration has completed.
   - `n`, `k`, `nums`, and `idx` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop head directly.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`num_tests` is a positive integer such that 0 < num_tests <= 999, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing integers from 1 to 16777216 with an additional element `k - nums[24]` and now includes `k + 1`, `idx` is 24**
