Output State: **`num_tests` is a positive integer such that \(0 < \text{num_tests} \leq 999\), `n` is the integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is less than 16, `nums` is a list containing \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]\), `idx` is 2, and `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code `nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(24)]` generates a list of integers where each element is \(2^i\) for \(i\) ranging from 0 to 23. This list replaces the original `nums` list, which was specified to contain a different set of values. However, since the initial state already mentions that `nums` is a list containing \([2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, `k-15`, `k+17`\], the new list generated by the code does not match the initial state's description. Therefore, the initial state's description of `nums` is updated to the newly generated list. All other variables remain unchanged.
