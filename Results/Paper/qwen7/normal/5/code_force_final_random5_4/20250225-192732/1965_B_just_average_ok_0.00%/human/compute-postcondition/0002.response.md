Output State: **`num_tests` is a positive integer such that 1 <= num_tests <= 1000, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split, `nums` is a list containing integers from 1 to 16777216 (which are powers of 2 up to \(2^{24}\)).**

Explanation: The code creates a list `nums` using a list comprehension where each element is calculated as \(1\) left-shifted by \(i\), for \(i\) ranging from \(0\) to \(23\). This results in a list of integers that are powers of 2, starting from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\). The values of `num_tests`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
