Output State: **`num_tests` is a positive integer such that \(0 < \text{num_tests} \leq 999\), `n` is the integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is less than 16, `nums` is a list containing \([2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, `k-15`, `k+17`\], `idx` is 2, and `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. It does not modify the existing values of `num_tests`, `nums`, or `idx`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
