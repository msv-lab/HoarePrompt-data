Output State: `num_tests` is a positive integer such that 1 <= num_tests <= 1000, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `k` must be at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing integers from 1 to 16777216, `idx` is 25.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `k >= 1 << idx`. Since `1 << idx` doubles with each iteration starting from `1 << 0 = 1`, after 24 iterations (`idx` will be 24), `1 << idx` will be `16777216`. Therefore, the loop will execute 25 times in total, making `idx` equal to 25 when the loop finishes. At this point, `k` must be at least `16777216` because it needs to satisfy the condition `k >= 1 << 24` in the last iteration.
