Output State: **`num_tests` is a positive integer such that \(0 < \text{num_tests} \leq 999\), `n` is the integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is less than 16, `nums` is a list containing \([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, k-16, k+17]\), `idx` is 3**.

Explanation: The code appends the value `k + nums[idx] + 1` to the list `nums`. Given that `nums[idx]` is `nums[3]` (which is 8) and `idx` is 3, the value appended is `k + 8 + 1 = k + 9`. Therefore, the new list `nums` is updated to include `k + 17` instead of just `k + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
