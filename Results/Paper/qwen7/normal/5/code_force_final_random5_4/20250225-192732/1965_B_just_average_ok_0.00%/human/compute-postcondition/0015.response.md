Output State: **`num_tests` is a positive integer such that 1 <= num_tests <= 1000, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing integers from 1 to 16777216 with an additional element `k - nums[24]` and now includes `k + 1`, `idx` is 24, `nums` is updated to include `k + nums[idx] + 1` which is `k + (24) + 1 = k + 25**.

In this output state, the list `nums` has been updated to include the new element `k + 25`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
