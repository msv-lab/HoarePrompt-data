Postcondition: `m` is greater than 2, `i` is 3, `t` is at least 3, `start` is greater than 0, `s` is either 1 or the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, `d1` and `d2` are defaultdicts initialized with int type, `inc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers entered by the user, and `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the original `mini`, where `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` in the if part and not equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` in the else part.
