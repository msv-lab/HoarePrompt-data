Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `start` is an integer entered by the user minus 3, `end` is now an integer entered by the user minus 2, `s` is 0, `s2` is either the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` if `start < end`, or the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` if `start >= end`.**

Explanation: The line `s = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `s`. No other changes are made to the other variables or their conditions. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the assignment of `s` to 0.
