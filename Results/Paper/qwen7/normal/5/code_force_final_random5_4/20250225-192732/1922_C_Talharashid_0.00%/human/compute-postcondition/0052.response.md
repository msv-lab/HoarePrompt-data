Output State: **`start` is increased by `inc` and must not be equal to `end`; `mini` is the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `11111111`; `s` is increased by the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`.**

This means that the variable `start` has been increased by the value of `inc` and must not be equal to `end`. The variable `mini` remains the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `11111111`. Additionally, the variable `s` has been updated by adding the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` to its current value.
