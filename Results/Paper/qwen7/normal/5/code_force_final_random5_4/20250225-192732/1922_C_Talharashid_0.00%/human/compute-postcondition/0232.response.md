Output State: **`start` is equal to the length of `lst` minus 3, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `s` is either 1 or `abs(lst[len(lst) - 2] - lst[len(lst) - 3])`, and `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the original `mini`.**

Explanation: The variable `start` is incremented by the value of `inc`, which is -1. Therefore, `start` becomes the original value of `start` minus 1. Since `start` was originally equal to the length of `lst` minus 2, after adding `-1`, `start` becomes the length of `lst` minus 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
