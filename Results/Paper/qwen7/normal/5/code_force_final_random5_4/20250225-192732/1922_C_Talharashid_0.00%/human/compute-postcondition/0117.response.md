Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is `start - 1`, `end` is `end - 1`**

Explanation: The code `end -= 1` decrements the value of `end` by 1. The other variables (`i`, `m`, and `start`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their states remain unchanged. The updated state of `end` is `end - 1`.
