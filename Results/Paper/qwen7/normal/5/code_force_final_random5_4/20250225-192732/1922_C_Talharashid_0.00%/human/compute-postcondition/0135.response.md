Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is `start` - 1, `end` is `end` - 1, `s` is 0, `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`**.

The code `s2 = abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` calculates the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` and assigns it to `s2`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
