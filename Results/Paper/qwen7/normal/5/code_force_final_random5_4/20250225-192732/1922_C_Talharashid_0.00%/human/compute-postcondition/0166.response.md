Postcondition: **`i` is `m-1`, `start` is `0`, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `s` is `0`, `s2` retains the value it had after the last iteration, `inc` is `1`, `s1` is irrelevant, `mini` is `11111111`, `d2[start]` is `0`, `d1` and `d2` are unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers entered by the user, and the current value of `start` is less than the length of `lst` minus one**
