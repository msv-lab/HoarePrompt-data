Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `start` is `start - 1`, `end` is an integer entered by the user - 1, `s` is 0, `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `s2` as the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`. The values of `m`, `i`, `start`, `end`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states. The new value of `s2` depends on the values of `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`, which are not specified in the initial state.
