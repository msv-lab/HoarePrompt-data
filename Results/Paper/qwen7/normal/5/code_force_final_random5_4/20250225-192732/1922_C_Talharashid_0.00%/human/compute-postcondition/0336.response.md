To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition of the `while` loop, which is `start != end`.

Let's break down the relevant information:

- The loop continues as long as `start` is not equal to `end`.
- We need to ensure that `start` is not equal to `end` for the loop to continue.

Given the current state:
- `start` is 4
- `m` is greater than 2 (not directly relevant to the loop condition)
- `i` is 3 (not directly relevant to the loop condition)
- `t` is at least 3 (not directly relevant to the loop condition)
- `start` is greater than 0 (not directly relevant to the loop condition)
- `s` is either 1 or the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]` (not directly relevant to the loop condition)
- `d1[start]` is `s` (not directly relevant to the loop condition)
- `d2` are defaultdicts initialized with int type (not directly relevant to the loop condition)
- `inc` is 1 (not directly relevant to the loop condition)
- `n` is an input integer (not directly relevant to the loop condition)
- `lst` is a list of integers entered by the user (not directly relevant to the loop condition)
- `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the original `mini`, where `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` in the if part and not equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` in the else part (not directly relevant to the loop condition)

The only state that affects the loop condition is `start`. For the loop to continue, `start` must not be equal to `end`.

Since `start` is currently 4, to ensure the loop continues, `end` must be different from 4.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `end` must be different from 4.

State: **`start` is 4, `end` must be different from 4**
