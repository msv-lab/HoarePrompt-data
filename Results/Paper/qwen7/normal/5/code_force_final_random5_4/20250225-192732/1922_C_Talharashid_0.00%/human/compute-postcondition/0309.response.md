Output State: **`m` must be greater than 2, `i` is 3, `t` must be at least 3, `start` is 0, `end` is an integer entered by the user - 3, `s` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with int type, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with int type, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The line `start = 0` updates the value of `start` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
