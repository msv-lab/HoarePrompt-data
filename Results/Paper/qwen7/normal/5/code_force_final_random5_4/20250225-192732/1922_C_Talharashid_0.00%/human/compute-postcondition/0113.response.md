Output State: **`start` is -1, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `s` is the sum of absolute differences calculated throughout the loop, `d2[start]` is `s`, and `mini` is the minimum value found during the loop execution; `m` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `m = int(input())` assigns the integer value of the user's input to the variable `m`. The other variables (`start`, `end`, `inc`, `s`, `d2[start]`, and `mini`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes the new value of `m` along with the unchanged values of the other variables.
