Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `m` must be greater than 2, `i` is 3, `t` must be at least 3, `start` is 0, `end` is the length of `lst` - 1, `s` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict initialized with int type, `d2` is a defaultdict initialized with int type, `inc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers entered by the user.
Code of the loop:
while start != end:
    mini = 11111111
    if start + 1 < len(lst):
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
    if start - 1 > -1:
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
    if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
        s += 1
    else:
        s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
    start += inc
    d1[start] = s


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start` is 4, `m` is greater than 2, `i` is 3, `t` is at least 3, `start` is greater than 0, `s` is either 1 or the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, `d1[start]` is `s`, `d2` are defaultdicts initialized with int type, `inc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers entered by the user, and `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the original `mini`, where `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` in the if part and not equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` in the else part.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `start` is 8, `end` must be different from 4, `mini` is the minimum value between abs(lst[3] - lst[4]) and 11111111, `s` is either 1 if `mini` equals abs(lst[4] - lst[4 + inc]), or `s` is the original value of `s` plus abs(lst[4] - lst[4 + inc]), `d1[start]` is `s`
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `start` is 9, `end` is different from 8, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[7] - lst[8])` and `11111111`, `s` is the original value of `s` plus either `1` or `abs(lst[4] - lst[4 + inc])`, and `d1[start]` is equal to `s`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
