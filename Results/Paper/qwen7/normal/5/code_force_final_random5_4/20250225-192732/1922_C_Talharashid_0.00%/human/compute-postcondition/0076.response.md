`s` is incremented by 1. The value of `start` is `len(lst) - 2`, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, and `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` and 11111111, provided that `start + inc` is not less than -1. If `start + inc` is less than -1, then `mini` remains 11111111. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is 1, `start` is the length of `lst` minus 2, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, and `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` and 11111111, provided that `start + inc` is not less than -1. If `start + inc` is less than -1, then `mini` remains 11111111.**
