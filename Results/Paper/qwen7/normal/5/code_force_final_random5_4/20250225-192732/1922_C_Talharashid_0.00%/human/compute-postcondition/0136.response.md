Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `start` is `start` - 1, `end` is `end` - 1, `s` is 0, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])`, `s2` is either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` if `start < end` is true, or `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` if `start < end` is false.**

Explanation: The code calculates `s1` as the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`. The values of `i`, `m`, `start`, `end`, and `s2` remain unchanged from their initial or previous states. The value of `s1` is now determined based on the current values of `start` and `end`.
