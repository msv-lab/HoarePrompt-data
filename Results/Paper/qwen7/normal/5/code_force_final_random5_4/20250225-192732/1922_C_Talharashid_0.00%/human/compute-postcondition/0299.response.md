Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `start` is `start` - 2, `end` is an integer entered by the user - 3, `s` is 0, `s2` is the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` to `s2`. Since `start` and `end` are defined as `start - 2` and an integer entered by the user minus 3 respectively, `s2` is updated to reflect this calculation. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state.
