Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `start` is `start` - 2, `end` is an integer entered by the user - 3, `s` is 0, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`, and `s2` is 0.**

Explanation: The code updates `s1` to the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`. Since `start` and `end` are not explicitly defined before the code, they remain as described in the initial state. The other variables (`m`, `i`, `s`, and `s2`) are not affected by the code. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
