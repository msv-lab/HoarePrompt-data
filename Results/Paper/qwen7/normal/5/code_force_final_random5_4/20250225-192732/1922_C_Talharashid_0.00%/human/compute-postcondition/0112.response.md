Output State: `start` is -1, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `s` is the sum of absolute differences calculated throughout the loop, `d2[start]` is `s`, and `mini` is the minimum value found during the loop execution.

To explain further, since `start` is initially set to the length of `lst` minus 1 and decreases by 1 each iteration (`inc` is -1), it will eventually reach -1 after `len(lst)` iterations. The variable `end` remains 0 throughout the loop. The variable `s` accumulates the sum of the minimum absolute differences found between adjacent elements in `lst`. The dictionary `d2` is updated with the current value of `s` at each iteration when `start` matches the updated `start` value after the loop ends. The variable `mini` keeps track of the minimum absolute difference found during the loop execution.
