Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `start` is the integer entered by the user - 2, `end` is the integer entered by the user - 2, `s` is 0, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`, `s2` is the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `s2` to be the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since the exact values of `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` are not provided, `s2` is expressed as the absolute difference between these two elements.
