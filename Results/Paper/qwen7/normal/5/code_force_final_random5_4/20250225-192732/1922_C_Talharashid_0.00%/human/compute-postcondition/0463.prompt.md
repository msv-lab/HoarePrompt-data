Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is reduced to an input integer, and all other variables (`n`, `a`, `m`, `x_i`, `y_i`) remain in their initial state.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    d1 = defaultdict(int)
    d2 = defaultdict(int)
    n = int(input())
    lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
    start = 0
    end = len(lst) - 1
    inc = 1
    s = 0
    while start != end:
        mini = 11111111
        if start + 1 < len(lst):
            mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
        if start - 1 > -1:
            mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
        if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
            s += 1
        else:
            s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
        start += inc
        d1[start] = s
    start = len(lst) - 1
    end = 0
    inc = -1
    s = 0
    while start != end:
        mini = 11111111
        if start + 1 < len(lst):
            mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
        if start - 1 > -1:
            mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
        if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
            s += 1
        else:
            s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
        start += inc
        d2[start] = s
    m = int(input())
    for i in range(m):
        start, end = map(int, input().split())
        start -= 1
        end -= 1
        s = 0
        if start < end:
            s1 = abs(d1[end] - d1[start])
            s2 = abs(d2[start] - d2[end])
        else:
            s1 = abs(d2[end] - d2[start])
            s2 = abs(d1[start] - d1[end])
        print(min(s1, s2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` is equal to `m-1`. The variables `start`, `end`, and `s` remain as they were last updated within the loop's body. Specifically, `start` and `end` are decremented by 1 with each iteration, so their final values will be `-m` and `-m-1` respectively (assuming they started from non-positive integers). The variable `s` remains 0 because it is reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration. 

Additionally, the variable `s2` retains the value it had after the last iteration, which depends on whether `start < end` was true or false during the last iteration. If `start < end` was true, `s2` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`; if `start < end` was false, `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`. The variable `s1` is set to `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])` if `start < end` was false during the last iteration, but since `s` is always set to 0 at the start of each iteration, `s1` does not affect the final state of `s2`.

The variable `mini` remains unchanged from its initial or previous state outside the loop, and `m` is unchanged as it is used only for controlling the loop's iteration count. The variable `d2[start]` is updated to `s` (the sum of absolute differences) after the loop completes.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `start` is `start` - 2, `end` is an integer entered by the user - 3, `s` is 0, and `s2` is the absolute difference between either `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` (if `start >= end`) or `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` (if `start < end`).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `m` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `m-1`, `start` is the initial `start` value minus `2 * m`, `end` is the last `end` value entered by the user minus 1, `s` is 0, and if `start < end`, then `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`; otherwise, `s2` is the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`.

This output state describes the final conditions of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations. The `start` value is adjusted by subtracting twice the number of iterations (`2 * m`) from the initial `start` value. The `end` value is the last `end` value entered by the user, decremented by 1. The variable `s` remains 0 throughout the loop. The value of `s2` depends on whether `start` is less than `end`, using the values of `d1` and `d2` arrays as described.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
