Postcondition: `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini`, `start` is incremented by 1, `end` remains unchanged, `s`, `s2`, `inc`, `d2[start]`, `t`, `n`, and `lst` retain their original values, and the current value of `start` is still less than the length of `lst` minus one. Additionally, `mini` is equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`.
