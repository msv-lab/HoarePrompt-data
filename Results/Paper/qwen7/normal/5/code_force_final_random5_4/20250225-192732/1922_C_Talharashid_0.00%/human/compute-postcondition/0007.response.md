Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory int, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory int, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `end` is the length of `lst` minus 1.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `len(lst) - 1` to the variable `end`. This means `end` now holds the index of the last element in the list `lst`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
