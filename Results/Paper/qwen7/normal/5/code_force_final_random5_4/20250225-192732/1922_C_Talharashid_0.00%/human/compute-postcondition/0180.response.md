Output State: **`mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini`, `start` is incremented by 1, `end` remains unchanged, `s` is increased by `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `s2`, `inc`, `d2[start]`, `t`, `n`, and `lst` retain their original values, and the current value of `start` is still less than the length of `lst` minus one, and `mini` is not equal to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`**.

This means that the value of `s` has been updated to include the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states, and the condition involving `mini` also remains valid.
