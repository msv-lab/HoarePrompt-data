Output State: **`start` is equal to the length of `lst` minus 1.**

Explanation: The code sets the variable `start` to the length of the list `lst` minus 1. Since the initial state mentions that all iterations of the loop have been executed, the value of `start` is updated to reflect the final length of `lst` minus 1. No other variables are affected by this line of code.
