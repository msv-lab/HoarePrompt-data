Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `start != end`.
2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `start` is 8
   - `end` must be different from 4
   - `mini` is the minimum value between `abs(lst[3] - lst[4])` and 11111111
   - `s` is either 1 if `mini` equals `abs(lst[4] - lst[4 + inc])`, or `s` is the original value of `s` plus `abs(lst[4] - lst[4 + inc])`
   - `d1[start]` is `s`

3. **Determine What Needs to Be Adjusted**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `start` is not equal to `end`.
   - To ensure the loop executes one more time, `start` must not be equal to `end` at the beginning of the next iteration.

Given that `start` is currently 8, for the loop to continue, `end` must not be 8. Since `end` must already be different from 4 (which is a given condition), we need to ensure that `end` is not 8.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `end`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`start` is 8, `end` must be different from 8, `mini` is the minimum value between `abs(lst[3] - lst[4])` and 11111111, `s` is either 1 if `mini` equals `abs(lst[4] - lst[4 + inc])`, or `s` is the original value of `s` plus `abs(lst[4] - lst[4 + inc])`, `d1[start]` is `s`**
