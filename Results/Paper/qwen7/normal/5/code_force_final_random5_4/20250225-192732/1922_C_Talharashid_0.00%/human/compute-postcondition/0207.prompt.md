Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `m-1`, `start` is `0`, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `s` is `0`, `s2` retains the value it had after the last iteration, `inc` is `1`, `s1` is irrelevant, `mini` remains unchanged, `d2[start]` is `0`, `d1` and `d2` are unchanged, `t` is unchanged, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers entered by the user.
Code of the loop:
while start != end:
    mini = 11111111
    if start + 1 < len(lst):
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1]), mini)
    if start - 1 > -1:
        mini = min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)
    if mini == abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc]):
        s += 1
    else:
        s += abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])
    start += inc
    d1[start] = s


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` and the previous value of `mini`, `start` is incremented by `inc`, `end` remains unchanged, `s` is either 1 more than its previous value (if `mini` equals `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`) or increased by `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` (if `mini` does not equal `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`), `d1[start]` is assigned the value of `s`, `s2`, `inc`, `d2[start]`, `t`, `n`, and `lst` retain their original values, and the current value of `start` is still less than the length of `lst` minus one.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `mini` is the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and 11111111, `start` is increased by `inc`, `s` is either 1 more than its previous value or increased by `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` (depending on whether `mini` equals `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` or not), `d1[start]` is assigned the value of `s`, `s2`, `inc`, `d2[start]`, `t`, `n`, and `lst` retain their original values, and `end` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and `11111111`, `start` is increased by `inc`, `s` is either increased by 1 or by `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])`, `d1[start]` is assigned the value of `s`, `s2`, `inc`, `d2[start]`, `t`, `n`, and `lst` retain their original values, and `end` remains unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
