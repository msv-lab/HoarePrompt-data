Output State: **`mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` and the previous value of `mini`, `start` is incremented by `inc`, `end` remains unchanged, `s` is either 1 more than its previous value (if `mini` equals `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`) or increased by `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` (if `mini` does not equal `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`), `s2`, `inc`, `d2[start]`, `t`, `n`, and `lst` retain their original values, and the current value of `start` is still less than the length of `lst` minus one.**

Explanation: The code `start += inc` increments the value of `start` by `inc`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
