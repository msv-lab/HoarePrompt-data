Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory int, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory int, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `end` must be 0, `s` is 0, `mini` is the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `11111111`, and `start - 1 > -1` and `mini` is not updated to the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` and `mini`.
