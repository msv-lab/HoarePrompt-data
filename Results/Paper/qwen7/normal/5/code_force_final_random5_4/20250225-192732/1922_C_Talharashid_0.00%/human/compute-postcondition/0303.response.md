Output State: **Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `start` is `start` - 2, `end` is an integer entered by the user - 3, `s` is 0, and `s2` is the absolute difference between either `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` (if `start >= end`) or `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` (if `start < end`).**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the following conditions will hold true:
- The variable `m` must be greater than 2 since the loop runs for `m` times.
- The loop variable `i` will be equal to `m - 1`.
- The `start` variable will be updated to `start - (m - 1)`, which simplifies to `start - 2` after 3 iterations.
- The `end` variable will be the integer entered by the user reduced by 3, as it was decremented by 1 in each iteration.
- The variable `s` remains 0 because it is reinitialized to 0 at the beginning of each iteration.
- The variable `s2` will be the absolute difference between either `d1[start]` and `d1[end]` (if `start >= end`) or `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` (if `start < end`), based on the condition checked at the start of the loop.
