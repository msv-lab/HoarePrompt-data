Postcondition: `m` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `start` is an integer entered by the user minus 5, `end` is an integer entered by the user minus 6, `s` is 0, if `start` is less than `end`, then `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]`; otherwise, `s2` is the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`.
