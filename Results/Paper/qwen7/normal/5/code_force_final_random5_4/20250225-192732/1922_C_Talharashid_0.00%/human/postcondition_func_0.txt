The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer n, a strictly increasing list of n non-negative integers, and an integer m representing the number of queries. It then handles each query by calculating the minimum absolute difference between the values at indices x_i and y_i in the list. The function outputs these minimum differences for all queries.
