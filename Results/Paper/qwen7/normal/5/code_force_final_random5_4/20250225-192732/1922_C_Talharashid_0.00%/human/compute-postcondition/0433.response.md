Output State: **`m` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `start` is `start - 2`, `end` is an integer entered by the user minus 1, `s` is 0, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`**.

This means that the value of `m` remains greater than 0, `i` remains 0, `start` is updated to `start - 2`, `end` remains an integer entered by the user minus 1, `s` remains 0, and a new variable `s1` is introduced which holds the absolute difference between the values of `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`.
