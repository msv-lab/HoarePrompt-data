Output State: **`end` is 0, `start` is `start + inc`, and `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` and 11111111.**

Explanation: The variable `start` is incremented by `inc`. The other variables (`end`, `mini`) remain unchanged from their initial or previous states. The value of `start` now is `start + inc`. The conditions for `mini` remain the same, being the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` and 11111111.
