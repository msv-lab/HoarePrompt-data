Output State: `start` is 0, `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `s` is the sum of absolute differences calculated throughout the loop, `d2[start]` is `s`, and `mini` is the minimum value found during the loop.

To explain this output state in more detail:
- The loop continues until `start` equals `end`. Given the initial conditions and the decrementing nature of `start` (since `inc` is -1), the loop will terminate when `start` reaches 0.
- During each iteration, the variable `s` accumulates the minimum absolute differences found between adjacent elements in the list `lst`.
- The variable `d2[start]` is updated with the current value of `s` at each iteration.
- The variable `mini` keeps track of the smallest absolute difference encountered during the loop but does not affect the final value of `s` directly.
