To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop head conditions and the variables involved.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `start != end`.

2. **Variables Involved in the Loop Head**:
   - `start`
   - `end`

3. **Current State**:
   - `start` is `lst` length minus 4.
   - `end` is 0.
   - `inc` is -1 (this is used in the loop body but not in the loop condition).
   - `s` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and `11111111` plus 1 or updated to `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` if `start - 1 > -1`, otherwise `s` remains unchanged.
   - `d2[start]` is `s`.
   - `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `11111111`.

### Adjusting the States:

For the loop to continue executing, the condition `start != end` must remain true. Given the current values:
- `start` is `lst` length minus 4.
- `end` is 0.

Since `start` is greater than `end` (assuming `lst` has more than 4 elements), the loop will continue as long as `start` is decremented and does not reach `end`.

### Required Adjustments:

- We need to decrement `start` by 1 (since `inc` is -1) until `start` becomes equal to `end`.
- Therefore, `start` should be adjusted to `start - 1`.

### Final State:

- `start` must be decremented by 1 to continue the loop.
- No other states need to be adjusted because the loop condition depends only on `start` and `end`.

### Answer:

State: **`start` is `lst` length minus 5, `end` is 0**
