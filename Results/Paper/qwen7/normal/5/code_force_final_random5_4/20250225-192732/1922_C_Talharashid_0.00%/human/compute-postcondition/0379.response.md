Output State: **`end` is 0, `start` is equal to `len(lst)` - 1, `mini` is the minimum of abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]) and 11111111, and `start` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mini` by comparing `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` with the current value of `mini`. Since `start` is equal to `len(lst) - 1`, `lst[start - 1]` refers to the last element of the list before `lst[start]`. The value of `mini` is updated to be the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and 11111111. All other variables remain unchanged.
