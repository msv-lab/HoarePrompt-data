Postcondition: **`j` is `n - 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `reachable_first_row` is `True` if `row1[n-1]` is `'>'`, otherwise it is `False`, `reachable_second_row` is `True` if `reachable_second_row` was `True` before the if else block, otherwise it is `False`, `results` list contains either `'YES'` or `'NO'` depending on the condition inside the if else block.**
