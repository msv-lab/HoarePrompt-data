Output State: **`reachable_first_row` is True, `results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each test_case in `test_cases` is a list where the first element is an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even), and the second and third elements are strings consisting of exactly n characters that are either '<' or '>', `n` is the first element of the current `test_case`, and `row1` and `row2` are the second and third elements of the current `test_case`.**

Explanation: The code only initializes the variable `reachable_first_row` to `True`. It does not modify the values of `results`, `t`, `test_cases`, `n`, `row1`, or `row2`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
