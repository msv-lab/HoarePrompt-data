You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of test cases. Each test case includes an even integer `n` and two strings representing the first and second rows of a grid. The function checks, for each test case, whether it's possible to move from the first row to the second row by only moving right ('>') and returns a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether the condition is met for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of columns `n`, the first row of the grid (`row1`), and the second row of the grid (`row2`).
   - These values are stored in a list of tuples `test_cases`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function processes each test case.
   - It initializes two flags: `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` to track whether the robot can reach the last column of the first row and the last column of the second row, respectively.
   - It iterates through each column `j` of the grid.
     - If the robot is currently in the first row and can move right (`row1[j] == '>'`):
       - If it reaches the last column (`j == n - 1`), set `reachable_second_row` to `True`.
       - Otherwise, if the next column in the second row can be reached (`j < n - 1` and `row2[j] == '>'`), set `reachable_second_row` to `True`.
     - If the robot is already in the second row and can move right (`row2[j] == '>'`):
       - If it reaches the last column (`j == n - 1`), set `reachable_second_row` to `True`.

3. **Output Generation:**
   - After processing each test case, the function appends 'YES' to the results if the robot can reach the last column of the second row, otherwise 'NO'.
   - The results are returned and printed.

### Correctness Check

1. **Initial Flags:**
   - The initial flags `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` are set to `True` and `False`, respectively. This means the robot starts in the first row and cannot start in the second row initially.

2. **Movement Logic:**
   - The logic checks if the robot can move right in the first row and then move to the second row if possible.
   - However, the logic does not properly handle the scenario where the robot might need to move back to the first row before reaching the second row.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not account for scenarios where the robot needs to backtrack to the first row and then move to the second row.
   - The logic only checks if the robot can move directly from the first row to the second row without considering intermediate steps.

### Example Analysis

Let's consider the example provided:

#### Test Case 1:
```
4
>><<
>>><
```
- The robot starts at `(1, 1)` and can move right to `(1, 2)`.
- From `(1, 2)`, it can move right to `(1, 3)`.
- From `(1, 3)`, it can move down to `(2, 3)`.
- From `(2, 3)`, it can move right to `(2, 4)`.
- Therefore, the robot can reach `(2, 4)`.

#### Test Case 2:
```
2
><
><
```
- The robot starts at `(1, 1)` and can move right to `(1, 2)`.
- From `(1, 2)`, it can move down to `(2, 2)`.
- Therefore, the robot can reach `(2, 2)`.

#### Test Case 3:
```
4
>>><
>><<
```
- The robot starts at `(1, 1)` and can move right to `(1, 2)`.
- From `(1, 2)`, it can move right to `(1, 3)`.
- From `(1, 3)`, it can move down to `(2, 3)`.
- From `(2, 3)`, it can move left to `(2, 2)`.
- From `(2, 2)`, it can move left to `(2, 1)`.
- From `(2, 1)`, it can move up to `(1, 1)`.
- From `(1, 1)`, it can move right to `(1, 2)`.
- From `(1, 2)`, it can move right to `(1, 3)`.
- From `(1, 3)`, it can move down to `(2, 3)`.
- From `(2, 3)`, it can move left to `(2, 2)`.
- From `(2, 2)`, it can move left to `(2, 1)`.
- From `(2, 1)`, it can move up to `(1, 1)`.
- The robot cannot reach `(2, 4)`.

#### Test Case 4:
```
6
>><<><
><>>><
```
- The robot starts at `(1, 1)` and can move right to `(1, 2)`.
- From `(1, 2)`, it can move right to `(1, 3)`.
- From `(1, 3)`, it can move right to `(1, 4)`.
- From `(1, 4)`, it can move right to `(1, 5)`.
- From `(1, 5)`, it can move right to `(1, 6)`.
- From `(1, 6)`, it can move down to `(2, 6)`.
- Therefore, the robot can reach `(2, 6)`.

The provided program does not correctly handle the backtracking and intermediate movements required to reach the target cell `(2, n)`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
