Postcondition: **`j` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `reachable_first_row` is `False`, `reachable_second_row` is `True` if `row2[0]` is `'>'`, otherwise `reachable_second_row` is `False`.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition `row1[j] == '>'` is true or false, the final state of the variables is such that `j` remains 0, `n` remains a positive integer, `reachable_first_row` stays `False`, and `reachable_second_row` is determined by whether `row2[0]` is `'>'`.
