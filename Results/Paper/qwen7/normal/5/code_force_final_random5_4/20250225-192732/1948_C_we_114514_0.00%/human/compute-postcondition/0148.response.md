Output State: **All variables remain unchanged except for `j` which equals `n`, `reachable_second_row` which remains `True`, and `reachable_first_row` which remains in its last known state based on the conditions evaluated during the loop's final iteration.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `j` will be equal to `n`, meaning the loop has iterated through all elements in the range defined by `n`. The variable `reachable_second_row` remains `True` throughout the loop's execution. The state of `reachable_first_row` depends on the conditions evaluated during the final iteration of the loop: if `row1[j] == '>'` when `j` equals `n - 1`, then `reachable_first_row` remains `True`; otherwise, if `j < n - 1` and `row2[j] == '>'`, `reachable_first_row` also remains `True`; otherwise, `reachable_first_row` becomes `False`. All other variables retain their values from the initial or previous states within the loop.
