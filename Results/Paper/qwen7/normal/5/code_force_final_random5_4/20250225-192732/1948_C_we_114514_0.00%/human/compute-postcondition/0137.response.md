Output State: **`reachable_first_row` is False, `j` is `n`, `reachable_second_row` remains True, and `reachable_first_row` remains False.**

Explanation: The line `reachable_first_row = False` explicitly sets `reachable_first_row` to `False`. The other variables (`n`, `j`, and `reachable_second_row`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
