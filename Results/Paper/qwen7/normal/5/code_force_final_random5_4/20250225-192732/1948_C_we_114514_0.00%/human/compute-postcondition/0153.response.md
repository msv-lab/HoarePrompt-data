Postcondition: `j` equals `n`, `reachable_second_row` is either `True` or `False` depending on whether the condition `reachable_second_row` was `True` in the if part, `reachable_first_row` remains in its last known state based on the conditions evaluated during the loop's final iteration, and `results` is a list containing either `['YES']` or `['NO']`.
