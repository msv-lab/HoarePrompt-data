Output State: **`j` is `n - 1` or `j + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, `reachable_first_row` is `True`, `reachable_second_row` is `True`.**

Explanation: The line `reachable_second_row = True` sets the variable `reachable_second_row` to `True`, regardless of its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged. Since `j` is either `n - 1` or `j + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, and the reachability of the first row remains unaffected, the output state reflects these unchanged conditions along with the updated `reachable_second_row`.
