Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the expression `range(n)`.
2. **Determine the initial state of `j`**: Since the loop starts with `j = 0` and increments `j` by 1 in each iteration, the initial value of `j` should be 0.
3. **Determine the value of `n`**: The value of `n` is not directly given in the loop head, but it is used as the upper bound for the range function. Therefore, `n` must be a positive integer for the loop to execute.

Now, let's consider the other variables mentioned in the state:
- `reachable_first_row`: This variable is not directly involved in the loop head, so its state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.
- `reachable_second_row`: Similarly, this variable is not directly involved in the loop head, so its state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.
- `results`: This variable is not directly involved in the loop head, so its state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.
- `test_case`: This variable is not directly involved in the loop head, so its state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given these considerations, the only variables that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `j` and `n`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`j` is 0, `n` must be a positive integer**
