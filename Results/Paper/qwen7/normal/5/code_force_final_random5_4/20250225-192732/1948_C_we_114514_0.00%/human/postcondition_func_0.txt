The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of test cases. Each test case includes an even integer `n` and two strings representing the first and second rows of a grid. The function checks, for each test case, whether it's possible to move from the first row to the second row by only moving right ('>') and returns a list of 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether the condition is met for each test case.
