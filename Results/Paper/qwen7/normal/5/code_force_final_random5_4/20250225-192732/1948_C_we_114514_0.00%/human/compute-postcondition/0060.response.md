Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is a valid integer from the `test_cases` list, `reachable_first_row` is false, `reachable_second_row` is true, and the current value of `row2[0]` is '>'**

The code `reachable_second_row = True` updates the value of `reachable_second_row` to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial states.
