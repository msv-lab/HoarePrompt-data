Output State: **`j` equals `n`, `reachable_second_row` is `False`, `reachable_first_row` remains in its last known state based on the conditions evaluated during the loop's final iteration, and `results` is a list containing 'NO'**.

In this case, the code appends the string 'NO' to the `results` list. Since no other variables are affected, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
