Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop is iterating over `j` using `range(n)`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables:**
   - From the given state, `n` and `row1` are assigned from `test_case`.
   - `j` is the loop variable that starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.

3. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - Whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1.
   - The initial value of `j` is 0 because the loop starts from the first iteration.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - We need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.
   - `j` should start at 0.

Given these points, we can adjust the states as follows:

- `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` are not directly related to the loop execution, so they do not need to be adjusted.
- `row2[j]` is not relevant to the loop initialization, so it does not need to be adjusted.
- `results` is not relevant to the loop initialization, so it does not need to be adjusted.
- `test_case` is not directly involved in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `j`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0**
