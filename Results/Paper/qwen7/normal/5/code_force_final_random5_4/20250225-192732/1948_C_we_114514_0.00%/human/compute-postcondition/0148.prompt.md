Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `reachable_first_row` is `True`, `reachable_second_row` is `False`, `row2[j]` is `'>', `results` is either `['YES']` or `['NO']`, `test_case` is the next element in `test_cases`, and `n` and `row1` are assigned from `test_case`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if reachable_first_row:
        if row1[j] == '>':
            if j == n - 1:
                reachable_second_row = True
        else:
            reachable_first_row = False
            if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                reachable_second_row = True
    if reachable_second_row:
        if row2[j] == '>':
            if j == n - 1:
                reachable_second_row = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is either incremented by 1, and `reachable_second_row` and `reachable_first_row` remain true. If `j` equals `n - 1`, then `reachable_second_row` remains true.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is `n`, `reachable_second_row` remains True, and `reachable_first_row` is determined as follows: it is True if `row1[j] == '>'`, and it is False if `j < n - 1` and `row2[j] == '>'`. Otherwise, `reachable_first_row` remains False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` must be greater than 0, `j` equals `n - 1`, `reachable_second_row` remains True, and `reachable_first_row` remains True if `row1[j] == '>'` and `False` if `j < n - 1` and `row2[j] == '>'`, otherwise `reachable_first_row` remains False. If `row1[j] != '>'`, then `reachable_first_row` becomes False, `reachable_second_row` remains True, and `j` remains `n`. If `j < n - 1` and `row2[j] == '>',` then `j` remains `n`. Otherwise, the conditions remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
