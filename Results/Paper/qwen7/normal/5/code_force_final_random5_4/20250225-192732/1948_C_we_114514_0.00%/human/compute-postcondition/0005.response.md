Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `j` and `n`**:
   - The initial value of `j` is not specified, but it will start from 0 in the first iteration of the loop.
   - The value of `n` is determined by the `test_case` list within `test_cases`. Since `test_cases` is a list of lists, and each list contains an integer `n`, the value of `n` will be one of these integers.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `j < n`.
   - Therefore, the loop will start executing when `j` is 0 and `n` is the value from the `test_case`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that the loop can start, which means `j` should be 0 and `n` should be a valid integer from the `test_cases` list.
   - The other variables (`reachable_first_row`, `reachable_second_row`, `results`, `t`, and `test_cases`) do not affect the loop's execution directly and do not need to be adjusted.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`j` is 0, `n` must be a valid integer from the `test_cases` list**
