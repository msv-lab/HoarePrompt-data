Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is `n`, `reachable_second_row` remains True. `reachable_first_row` is True if `row1[j] == '>'`, and it is False if `j < n - 1` and `row2[j] == '>'`. Otherwise, `reachable_first_row` remains False. This is because the if part does not change the postcondition when `j == n - 1`, and there is no else part to consider.
