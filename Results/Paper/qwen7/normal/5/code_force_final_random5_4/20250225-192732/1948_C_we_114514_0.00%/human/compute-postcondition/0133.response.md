Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`, and the range is defined by `n`. Therefore, the variables `j` and `n` are the only ones that can be adjusted.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `j < n`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `j` is equal to `n`.
   - `reachable_second_row` remains True.
   - `reachable_first_row` is determined based on the conditions provided.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `j` is currently equal to `n`, the loop condition `j < n` will be false, and the loop will terminate.
   - There are no changes needed for `reachable_second_row` or `reachable_first_row` because they are not part of the loop head.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` needs to be adjusted to `n - 1` for the loop to continue, but since `j` is already equal to `n`, the loop will not execute further.
   - `n` does not change within the loop itself.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time (which it won't in this case) would be:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `j` is `n - 1`, `reachable_second_row` remains True, and `reachable_first_row` is determined as follows: it is True if `row1[j] == '>'`, and it is False if `j < n - 1` and `row2[j] == '>'`. Otherwise, `reachable_first_row` remains False.**

However, since the loop will not execute again due to the current state where `j` equals `n`, the final state remains as provided:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `j` is `n`, `reachable_second_row` remains True, and `reachable_first_row` is determined as follows: it is True if `row1[j] == '>'`, and it is False if `j < n - 1` and `row2[j] == '>'`. Otherwise, `reachable_first_row` remains False.**
