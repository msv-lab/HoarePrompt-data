Output State: **reachable_first_row is True, reachable_second_row is False, results is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each test_case in `test_cases` is a list where the first element is an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even), and the second and third elements are strings consisting of exactly n characters that are either '<' or '>'**.

Explanation: The line `reachable_second_row = False` sets the variable `reachable_second_row` to `False`. The values of `reachable_first_row`, `results`, `t`, and the structure of `test_cases` remain unchanged from the initial state.
