Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in how it determines if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). Specifically, the logic for updating `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` is not correctly implemented. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Arrow Directions**:
   - The program checks if the current cell in `row1` or `row2` is pointing right (`>`). If it is, it updates the `reachable` status accordingly.
   - However, the logic does not properly account for the robot moving down to the second row when it encounters an arrow pointing up from the first row.

2. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loop should ensure that the robot can move from the first row to the second row and continue moving right until it reaches the end of the grid.
   - The current implementation does not correctly handle the transition from the first row to the second row when the robot moves down.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        row1 = input().strip()
        row2 = input().strip()
        test_cases.append((n, (row1, row2)))
    results = func_1(t, test_cases)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        (n, (row1, row2)) = test_case
        reachable_second_row = False
        for j in range(n):
            if j == 0:
                # Start at (1, 1)
                if row1[0] == '>':
                    reachable_second_row = True
                elif row1[0] == '<':
                    reachable_second_row = False
            else:
                if row1[j] == '>':
                    if j == n - 1:
                        reachable_second_row = True
                    elif row2[j] == '>':
                        reachable_second_row = True
                elif row1[j] == '<':
                    if j == 0:
                        reachable_second_row = False
                    elif row2[j - 1] == '>':
                        reachable_second_row = True
                elif row2[j - 1] == '<':
                    reachable_second_row = False
        if reachable_second_row:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
    return results
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Initialization**: The robot starts at `(1, 1)`. Depending on the direction of the arrow in the first column, the program sets `reachable_second_row` accordingly.
- **Loop Through Columns**: The loop iterates through each column:
  - If the current cell in `row1` is pointing right (`>`), the robot can move to the next column in `row1` or move down to `row2` if the next column in `row2` is also pointing right.
  - If the current cell in `row1` is pointing left (`<`), the robot cannot move to the next column in `row1` and must check if it can move down to `row2` based on the previous column in `row2`.
- **Final Check**: After the loop, if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, the robot can reach `(2, n)` and the result is 'YES'. Otherwise, the result is 'NO'.

This corrected program should accurately determine if the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)`.
