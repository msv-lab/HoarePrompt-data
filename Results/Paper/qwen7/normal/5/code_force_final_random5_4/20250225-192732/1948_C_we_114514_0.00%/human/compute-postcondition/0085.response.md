Output State: **`reachable_first_row` is `True`, `reachable_second_row` is `False`, `row2[j]` is `'>', `results` is either `['YES']` or `['NO']`, `test_case` is the next element in `test_cases`, and `n` and `row1` are assigned from `test_case`.**

Explanation: The code simply sets `reachable_second_row` to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
