Output State: **reachable_second_row is True, `reachable_first_row` is True if `row1[j] == '>'`, and it is False if `j < n - 1` and `row2[j] == '>'`. Otherwise, `reachable_first_row` remains False.**

Explanation: The line `reachable_second_row = True` sets the value of `reachable_second_row` to `True`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `j`, or the conditions determining the value of `reachable_first_row`. Therefore, the conditions for `reachable_first_row` remain the same as they were in the initial state.
