Output State: **`j` is `n - 1`, `n` is a valid integer from the `test_cases` list, `reachable_first_row` is false, `reachable_second_row` is true, and the current value of `row2[j]` is '>'**.

Explanation: The line `reachable_second_row = True` does not affect the values of `j`, `n`, `reachable_first_row`, or the value of `row2[j]`. It only changes the value of `reachable_second_row` to `True`. Therefore, these variables retain their original values, and the output state reflects this unchanged condition.
