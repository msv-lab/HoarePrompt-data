Output State: **reachable_second_row is True, `j` is 1, `n` is a valid integer from the `test_cases` list, `reachable_first_row` is false.**

Explanation: The code simply sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`. This does not affect the values of `j`, `n`, `reachable_first_row`, or the condition regarding `row2[0]`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial values and conditions.
