Output State: **`reachable_second_row` is True, `j` is 0, `n` is a valid integer from the `test_cases` list, `reachable_first_row` is false, and the current value of `j` is less than `n - 1`.**

Explanation: The code sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`. All other variables (`j`, `n`, `reachable_first_row`, and the condition on `j`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
