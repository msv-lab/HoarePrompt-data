Output State: **`i` is 0; `pre[0][0]` is 1**

Explanation: The code `pre[i][0] += 1` increments the value at `pre[i][0]` by 1. Given that `i` is initially 0, the value at `pre[0][0]` is incremented by 1. Since `pre` is not defined in the initial state, we assume it is a list of lists. Initially, `pre[0][0]` is assumed to be 0 (as no other value is given), so after executing the code, `pre[0][0]` becomes 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0.
