Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 0, `n` is 32, `cur` is `prefix[0]`, `ans` is 0, for each `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` contains the total count of 1s in the binary representation of all numbers from 0 to 31 up to and including the `j`-th bit, and `suf[j][0]` contains the total count of 0s in the same range.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    y = arr[i - 1]
    k = y.bit_length() - 1
    ans += pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]
    c = prefix[i]
    for j in range(32):
        if c >> j & 1:
            pre[j][1] += 1
            suf[j][1] -= 1
        else:
            pre[j][0] += 1
            suf[j][0] -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `j` is 31, `n` is 32, `y` is `arr[0]`, `k` is 5, `ans` is `pre[5][0] * suf[5][1] + pre[5][1] * suf[5][1]`, `c` is `prefix[1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `c` remains 32, `j` is 31 after all iterations, `k` is 4, `y` is `arr[31]`, `ans` is calculated based on the final values of `pre` and `suf` arrays, `c` is still `prefix[32]`, and `i` is 32.

Explanation: After the loop completes all 32 iterations (since `j` ranges from 0 to 31), `j` will be 31. For each bit position `j` in the binary representation of `c` (which is 32 in decimal or '100000' in binary), the loop updates the `pre` and `suf` arrays. Since `c` is 32 (binary '100000'), only the 5th bit (from the right) is set. Therefore, `pre[5][1]` will be incremented once and `suf[5][1]` will be decremented once. All other `pre[j][1]` and `suf[j][1]` values will be 0, and similarly, all `pre[j][0]` and `suf[j][0]` values except for `pre[5][0]` will be 0. The value of `k` is calculated as `arr[31].bit_length() - 1`, which is 5 since `arr[31]` has 6 bits (considering the bit length starts from 1). The `ans` variable is updated based on these final values of `pre` and `suf`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `j` will be 31, `c` will be either `prefix[32]` or `prefix[34]` depending on the final value of `c >> j & 1`, `k` will remain 5, `y` will be `arr[32]`, `ans` will be updated by adding `pre[k][0] * suf[k][1] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][0]` for each iteration, `c` will remain `prefix[32]` or `prefix[34]` depending on the final value of `c >> j & 1`, `i` will be 34, `suf[j][1]` will be 0 for all `j` from 0 to 31 if `c >> j & 1` was true for that `j`, otherwise `suf[j][0]` will be `suf[0][0] - (number of times `c >> j & 1` was false)`, and `pre[j][1]` will be incremented by 1 for all `j` from 0 to 31 if `c >> j & 1` was true for that `j`, otherwise `pre[j][0]` will be increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
