Output State: **`j` is 31, `n` is 32, `y` is `arr[31]`, `k` is `arr[31].bit_length() - 1`, `ans` is `pre[5][0] * suf[5][1] + pre[5][1] * suf[5][1] + pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `c` is `prefix[1]`, `i` is 32**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by adding `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]` to its current value. Here, `k` is calculated as `arr[31].bit_length() - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
