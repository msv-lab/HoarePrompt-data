Output State: `i` is 31, `n` is 32, `cur` is `prefix[31]`, `j` is 31, `suf` is an array where each element `suf[j]` is a list containing two integers. After the loop executes all 32 iterations, for each `j` from 0 to 31, if `cur >> j & 1` is true, then `suf[j][1]` will contain the count of positions where the bit at position `j` in `cur` is 1, otherwise `suf[j][0]` will contain the count of positions where the bit at position `j` is 0.
