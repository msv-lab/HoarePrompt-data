Output State: `i` is 30 and `j` is 31. For each `j` from 0 to 31, if the bit at position `j` of `cur` is 1, then `suf[j][1]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `suf[j][0]` is incremented by 1. This means that after the loop completes, `suf[j][1]` will contain the count of bits set to 1 for each position `j`, and `suf[j][0]` will contain the count of bits set to 0 for each position `j`.
