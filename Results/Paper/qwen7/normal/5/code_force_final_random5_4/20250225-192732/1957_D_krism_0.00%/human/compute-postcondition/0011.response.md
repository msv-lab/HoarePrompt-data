Output State: The `prefix` list will contain the integer 0 followed by the cumulative XOR of all elements in the `arr` list. Specifically, if `arr = [a1, a2, a3, ..., an]`, then `prefix` will be `[0, a1, a1 ^ a2, a1 ^ a2 ^ a3, ..., a1 ^ a2 ^ ... ^ an]`. The variable `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and `n` remains an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\). The `arr` list remains unchanged as it was when the loop started.

In simpler terms, the `prefix` list will contain 0 followed by the cumulative XOR of all elements in the original `arr` list, with each subsequent element being the XOR of all previous elements including the current one.
