Output State: **`i` is 31, `n` is 32, `cur` is `prefix[31]`, `j` is 2, `suf[2][1]` is 1**

Explanation: The code increments the second element of the list `suf[j]` by 1, where `j` is 2. Initially, `suf[2][1]` is assumed to be 0 (since no specific initial value is given). After executing `suf[j][1] += 1`, `suf[2][1]` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
