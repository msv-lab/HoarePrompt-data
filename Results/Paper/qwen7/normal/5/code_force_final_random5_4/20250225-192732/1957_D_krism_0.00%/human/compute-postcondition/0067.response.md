Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variables involved in the loop control. Here, the loop runs from `i = n` down to `i = 1`. The variables involved are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current Values**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 31 and `n` is 32.

3. **Check the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 1. Since `i` is currently 31, it is still greater than 1, so the loop can continue.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - `i` will be decremented by 1 in the next iteration, so `i` will become 30.
   - `n` remains unchanged because it is the upper limit of the loop and does not change within the loop.

5. **Final State Before the Next Iteration**:
   - `i` will be 30.
   - `n` will remain 32.
   - The other variables (`cur`, `j`, and `suf`) are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 30, `n` is 32**
