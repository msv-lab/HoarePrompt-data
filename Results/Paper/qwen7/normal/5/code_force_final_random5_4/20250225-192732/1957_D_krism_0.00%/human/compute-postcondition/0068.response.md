Output State: **`i` is 30; `cur` is `prefix[30]`**

In this case, the code assigns the value of `prefix[30]` to the variable `cur`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 30, and the value of `n` is also not affected. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `cur` and the unchanged values of `i` and `n`.
