Postcondition: **`j` is 1, `c` is either `prefix[32]` or `prefix[34]` depending on the value of `c >> j & 1`, `k` is 5, `y` is `arr[32]`, `ans` is updated by adding `pre[k][0] * suf[k][1] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][0]`, `c` remains `prefix[32]` or `prefix[34]` depending on the value of `c >> j & 1`, `i` is now 34, and `suf[j][1]` is updated to 0 if `c >> j & 1` is true, otherwise `suf[j][0]` is updated to `suf[0][0] - 1`. Additionally, `pre[j][1]` is incremented by 1 if `c >> j & 1` is true, otherwise `pre[j][0]` is increased by 1.**
