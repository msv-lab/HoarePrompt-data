Output State: **`prefix` is a list containing the integer 0 and another integer which is the result of `v ^ prefix[-1]`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, and `arr` must have at least one element.**

Explanation: The code appends a new value to the `prefix` list. This new value is calculated as the bitwise XOR (`^`) of `v` (which is the last element of the `prefix` list) and the last element of the `prefix` list itself. Since `prefix` initially contains only the integer 0, the new value appended is `v ^ 0`, which simplifies to `v`. Therefore, `prefix` now contains 0 and `v`. All other variables remain unchanged.
