You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the number of tuples (x,
y, z ) such that:

  * 1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n , and 
  * f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) . 

We define f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r} , where
\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the number of
described tuples.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    6 2 4
    
    1
    
    3
    
    5
    
    7 3 7 2 1

Output

    4
    0
    16
    
Note

In the first case, there are 4 such tuples in the array [6, 2, 4] :

  * (1 , 2 , 2 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2) = 4 \oplus 2 > (a_1 \oplus a_2) = 4 
  * (1 , 1 , 3 ): (a_1) \oplus (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 6 \oplus 0 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 2 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2 \oplus a_3) = 4 \oplus 6 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 3 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) \oplus (a_3) = 0 \oplus 4 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 

In the second test case, there are no such tuples.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 10^4), an integer \( n \) (1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 10^5), and a list of \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, ..., a_n \) (1 ≤ \( a_i \) ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it calculates and prints the cumulative XOR of the list elements, initializes two lists `pre` and `suf` to track counts of 0s and 1s in the binary representations of the cumulative XOR values, updates these counts iteratively, and finally computes and prints a result based on these counts. The function ultimately returns 0.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size `n` of the array and the array itself.
   - It computes the prefix XOR values, which is a crucial part of solving the problem.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - The prefix XOR values are stored in the `prefix` array, which is correctly initialized and updated.
   - This part is implemented correctly and is essential for calculating the required XOR operations efficiently.

3. **Pre and Suffix Arrays Initialization:**
   - The `pre` and `suf` arrays are initialized to store counts of bits being set to 0 or 1.
   - The `pre` array is initialized with 1 in all positions, which seems incorrect because it should be initialized to zero counts for each bit position.

4. **Counting Bitwise Operations:**
   - The program iterates backward through the array to update the suffix counts.
   - This part is correct and necessary for maintaining the counts of bit positions.

5. **Answer Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the answer using the pre and suffix arrays.
   - It correctly updates the counts in the `pre` and `suf` arrays as it iterates through the array.
   - However, the logic for counting valid tuples might be incorrect because the formula used to calculate `ans` does not seem to match the problem statement.

### Detailed Analysis of the Logic

The program attempts to count the number of valid tuples `(x, y, z)` such that:
\[ f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) \]

However, the current implementation of the logic to calculate `ans` does not seem to correctly implement this condition. Specifically, the formula used to calculate `ans`:
\[ ans += pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] \]
is not appropriate for the given problem.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to use a different approach to count the valid tuples. One possible correct approach involves using a segment tree or a similar data structure to efficiently query and update the prefix XOR values.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the current implementation has logical errors in the way it calculates the number of valid tuples. Therefore, the given program is not correct.
