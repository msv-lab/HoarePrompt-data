Postcondition: `j` is either 1 or 2, `n` is 32, `y` is `arr[0]`, `k` is 5, `ans` is `pre[5][0] * suf[5][1] + pre[5][1] * suf[5][1]`, `c` is `prefix[1]`. If `c` shifted right by `j` bits and bitwise AND with 1 is true (i.e., `j` is 1), then `suf[5][1]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise (i.e., `j` is 2), `pre[1][0]` is increased by 1 and `suf[2][0]` is decreased by 1.
