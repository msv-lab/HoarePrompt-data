Output State: **`n` is decreased by the number of iterations in the while loop, s is the sum calculated from the loop, there are three lines of input left, each containing two integers \(x_i, y_i\) such that \(-1000 \le x_i, y_i \le 1000\), representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This decreases the number of lines of input left by one. The values of `s` and the coordinates of the squares remain unchanged.
