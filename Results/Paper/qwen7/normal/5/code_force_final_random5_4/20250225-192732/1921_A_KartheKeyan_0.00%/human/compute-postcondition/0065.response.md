Output State: `n` is 0, `x` is an input integer from the last iteration's third split, `y` is an input integer from the last iteration's third split, `coord` is a list containing four tuples of input integers sorted in ascending order, `p2` is the square of the difference between the x-coordinates of the last and second-to-last points in `coord`, `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`, `p1` is the square of the difference between the x-coordinates of the second and first points in `coord`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `n` will be reduced to 0. The variables `x` and `y` will hold the values from the last set of inputs provided. The list `coord` will contain four tuples representing the sorted coordinates of the corners of the last square input, and `res` will be the result calculated based on these coordinates.
