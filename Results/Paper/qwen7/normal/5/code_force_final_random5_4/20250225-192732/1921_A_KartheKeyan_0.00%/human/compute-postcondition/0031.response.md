Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(4)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 4
   - `x` is an input integer
   - `y` is an input integer
   - `coord` is a list containing two tuples `[(4, input integer), (input integer, input integer)]`
   - `p2` is 0
   - `res` is 0
   - `n` is 1

3. **Determine if the loop can execute again**:
   - The loop condition is `for i in range(4)`, which means `i` should be less than 4 for the loop to continue.
   - Currently, `i` is 4, which means the loop has already completed its iterations.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is already 4, it cannot be incremented further within the current range.
   - Therefore, the loop will not execute again.

5. **Update the relevant states**:
   - `i` remains 4.
   - `n` remains 1 (since `n` is not part of the loop condition and does not change based on the loop).

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` remains 4.
- `n` remains 1.

Since no other variables in the loop head are affected, the final state is:

**State: `i` is 4, `n` is 1**
