Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. The logic for determining the side length of the square is flawed. The current implementation calculates distances between points, which does not necessarily give the side length of the square.
2. The sorting of coordinates might not correctly identify the pairs of opposite corners of the square.
3. The formula used to calculate the area (`res = abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))`) is incorrect. It assumes that `p1` and `p2` are the squares of the side lengths, but this is not guaranteed by the way the points are being processed.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    while n:
        coord = []
        for i in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            coord.append((x, y))
        
        # Find the unique distances between all pairs of points
        distances = set()
        for i in range(4):
            for j in range(i+1, 4):
                dist = math.sqrt((coord[i][0] - coord[j][0])**2 + (coord[i][1] - coord[j][1])**2)
                distances.add(dist)
        
        # The side length of the square should be the smaller distance
        side_length = min(distances)
        
        # Calculate the area of the square
        area = side_length ** 2
        print(area)
        
        n -= 1

func()
```

This corrected version properly identifies the side length of the square by calculating the unique distances between all pairs of points and then finding the minimum distance, which corresponds to the side length of the square. Finally, it calculates the area as the square of the side length.
