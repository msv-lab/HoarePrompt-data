Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `4` (the upper limit of the range function).

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 0 because `range(4)` generates values from 0 to 3.

3. **Understand the conditions for loop execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 4. Since `i` starts at 0, it will execute 4 times (0, 1, 2, 3).

4. **Consider the other given variables**:
   - `coord`: It is an empty list, but this does not affect the loop execution directly.
   - `n`: It must be at least 1, but this does not affect the loop execution directly since the loop is controlled by `i`.
   - `s`: This is the sum calculated from the loop, but its initial state is not relevant to the loop starting condition.
   - `res`: This is initialized to 0, but its initial state is not relevant to the loop starting condition.

5. **Adjust the states for the loop to execute**: The only variable that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `i`, which should be set to 0, and the loop will run for 4 iterations.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 0**
