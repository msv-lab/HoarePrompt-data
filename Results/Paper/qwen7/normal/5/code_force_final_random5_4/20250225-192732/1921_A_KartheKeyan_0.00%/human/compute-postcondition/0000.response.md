Output State: **There are four lines of input left, each containing two integers \(x_i, y_i\) such that \(-1000 \le x_i, y_i \le 1000\), representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area; n is decreased by the number of iterations in the while loop; s is the sum calculated from the loop.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer `n` which represents the number of iterations for the while loop. For each iteration, it reads an integer `l` and calculates `s` as `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2`. This calculation does not affect the input coordinates of the squares. After each iteration, `s` is printed and `n` is decremented by 1. Therefore, the initial state of the input coordinates remains unchanged, and `n` is reduced by the number of iterations. The value of `s` is the sum calculated from the loop, but its specific value depends on the input `l` for each iteration.
