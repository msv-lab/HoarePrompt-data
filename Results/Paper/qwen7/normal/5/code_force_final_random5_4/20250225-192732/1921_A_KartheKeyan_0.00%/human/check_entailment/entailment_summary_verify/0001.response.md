### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners.
   - The square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, and the coordinates are given in no particular order.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`n`).
   - For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners.
   - It sorts the coordinates, but this sorting might not be necessary for finding the side length of the square.
   - The code calculates the distances between pairs of points to find the side length of the square.

3. **Key Points to Verify:**
   - The distance calculation should be correct.
   - The side length of the square can be found by calculating the Euclidean distance between two adjacent corners.
   - The area of the square is the side length squared.

4. **Detailed Analysis:**
   - The code calculates the distances `p1` and `p2` between specific pairs of points.
   - `p1` is calculated between the second and first points, and `p2` is calculated between the fourth and third points.
   - These points are chosen arbitrarily, but since the square's sides are parallel to the axes, any pair of adjacent points will give the same side length.
   - The side length is then calculated as `sqrt(p1)` or `sqrt(p2)`, and the area is `res = abs(sqrt(p1) * sqrt(p2))`.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The code assumes that the side length is the same for all pairs of adjacent points, which is true for a square.
   - However, the code could be simplified by directly calculating the side length from any two adjacent points.
   - The current implementation might not handle all possible permutations of the corner coordinates correctly without sorting.

6. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic for calculating the side length and area is correct.
   - The code handles multiple test cases as expected.
   - The sorting step is unnecessary and might lead to incorrect results if the coordinates are not properly ordered.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Sorting Step:** The sorting step is unnecessary because the coordinates of a square with sides parallel to the axes will always form a consistent pattern regardless of the order. Sorting the coordinates can introduce errors if the coordinates are not already in a consistent order.
- **Distance Calculation:** The distances `p1` and `p2` are calculated correctly as the squared Euclidean distances between pairs of points. Since the square's sides are parallel to the axes, the distances will be the same for any pair of adjacent points.
- **Area Calculation:** The area is calculated correctly as the product of the side lengths, which is the same as the square of the side length.

However, the sorting step is redundant and can be removed without affecting the correctness of the program. The program will still work correctly even without sorting the coordinates.

### Conclusion:

The given code is logically correct and will produce the correct output for the given problem. The original assessment is accurate, but the sorting step can be removed to simplify the code.

**Final: True**

The program is correct.
