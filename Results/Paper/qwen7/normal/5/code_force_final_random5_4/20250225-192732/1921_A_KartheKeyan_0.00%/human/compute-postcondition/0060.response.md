Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing tuples of 4 input integers sorted in ascending order, `p2` is the square of the difference between the x-coordinates of the third and second points in `coord`, `res` is 0, `p1` is the difference between the x-coordinates of the second and first points in `coord`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `p2` as the squared Euclidean distance between the third and second points in the `coord` list. Since `coord` is a list of tuples of 4 input integers sorted in ascending order, `p2` is computed as \((coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])^2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1])^2\). The other variables remain unchanged.
