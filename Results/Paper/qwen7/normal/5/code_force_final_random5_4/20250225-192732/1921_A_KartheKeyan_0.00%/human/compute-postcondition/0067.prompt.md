You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: There are four lines of input, each containing two integers \(x_i, y_i\) such that \(-1000 \le x_i, y_i \le 1000\), representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.

            x, y = map(int, input().split())

        p1 = (coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2

    #State: Output State: `n` is 0, `x` is an input integer from the last iteration's third split, `y` is an input integer from the last iteration's third split, `coord` is a list containing four tuples of input integers sorted in ascending order, `p2` is the square of the difference between the x-coordinates of the last and second-to-last points in `coord`, `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`, `p1` is the square of the difference between the x-coordinates of the second and first points in `coord`.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `n` will be reduced to 0. The variables `x` and `y` will hold the values from the last set of inputs provided. The list `coord` will contain four tuples representing the sorted coordinates of the corners of the last square input, and `res` will be the result calculated based on these coordinates.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns whether the given coordinates form a valid square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
