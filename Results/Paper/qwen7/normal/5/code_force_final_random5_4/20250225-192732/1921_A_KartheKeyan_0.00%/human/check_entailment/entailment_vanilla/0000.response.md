### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners.
   - The square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, and the input guarantees that the points form a square.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`n`).
   - For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners.
   - It sorts the coordinates, but sorting alone does not help in identifying the sides of the square directly.
   - The code calculates the distances between pairs of points to identify the side length of the square.
   - It uses the Euclidean distance formula to compute the squared distances between two pairs of opposite corners.
   - The result is calculated as the product of the square roots of these distances, which should give the side length squared (i.e., the area).

3. **Potential Issues:**
   - The sorting step is unnecessary and might lead to confusion.
   - The logic to identify the side length is correct, but it can be simplified.
   - The code should directly compute the differences in x and y coordinates for adjacent points to identify the side length.

4. **Correct Implementation:**
   - Instead of calculating the squared distances between opposite corners, we can simply take the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates and the same for y-coordinates.
   - This will directly give us the side length of the square.

### Revised Code:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    while n:
        coord = []
        for i in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            coord.append((x, y))
        
        # Find the min and max x and y coordinates
        min_x = min(coord, key=lambda p: p[0])[0]
        max_x = max(coord, key=lambda p: p[0])[0]
        min_y = min(coord, key=lambda p: p[1])[1]
        max_y = max(coord, key=lambda p: p[1])[1]
        
        # Calculate the side length of the square
        side_length = max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y)
        
        # The area is the side length squared
        area = side_length ** 2
        print(area)
        
        n -= 1
```

### Conclusion:
The original code has a logical flaw in how it identifies the side length of the square. However, the overall approach is correct. After simplifying the logic, the code should work as expected.

**Correctness: False** (Original code has an unnecessary sorting step and a less efficient way to identify the side length).
