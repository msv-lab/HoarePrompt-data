Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given `for` loop is `i`. The loop runs from `0` to `3` (inclusive), meaning it will iterate 4 times in total.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `i` is 0
   - `x` is the first input integer
   - `y` is the second input integer
   - `coord` is a list containing the tuple `(x, y)`
   - `p2` is `x - y`
   - `res` is 0

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than 4. Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will increment to 1 in the next iteration.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1.
   - The other variables (`x`, `y`, `coord`, `p2`, `res`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head and their values do not depend on the loop iteration directly.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `x` is the first input integer, `y` is the second input integer, `coord` is a list containing the tuple `(x, y)`, `p2` is `x - y`, `res` is 0**
