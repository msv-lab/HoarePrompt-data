Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing the tuple (`x`, `y`), `p2` is `x - y`, `res` is 0**

Explanation: The code `coord.append((x, y))` adds the tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. The values of `i`, `x`, `y`, `p2`, and `res` remain unchanged from their initial states.
