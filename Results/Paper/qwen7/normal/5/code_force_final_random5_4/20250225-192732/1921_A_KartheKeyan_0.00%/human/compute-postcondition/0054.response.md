Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing the tuple (an input integer, an input integer), `p2` is `x - y`, `res` is 0**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space and assigns them to `x` and `y`. The initial values of `i`, `coord`, `p2`, and `res` remain unchanged. The `coord` list now contains a tuple with the values of `x` and `y`.
