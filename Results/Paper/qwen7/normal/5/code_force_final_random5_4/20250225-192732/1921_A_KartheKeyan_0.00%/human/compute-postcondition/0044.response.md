Output State: **`i` is 4, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is an empty list, `p2` is (input integer - y), `res` is abs(sqrt(input integer - y) * sqrt(abs((x - 4)))), `n` must be non-zero**

Explanation: The line `coord = []` assigns an empty list to the variable `coord`. All other variables (`i`, `x`, `y`, `p2`, `res`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
