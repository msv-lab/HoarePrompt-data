Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(4)`. The only variable that changes within this loop is `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than 4. Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the loop will run until `i` reaches 3.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i`**: Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, making `i` equal to 2.

5. **Check the conditions for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than 4. Since `i` is now 2, the loop will execute again.

6. **Adjust the states**: The only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which will be 2 at the start of the next iteration. The other variables (`x`, `y`, `coord`, `p2`, and `res`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `i` is 2, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing the tuple (`x`, `y`), `p2` is `x - y`, `res` is 0**
