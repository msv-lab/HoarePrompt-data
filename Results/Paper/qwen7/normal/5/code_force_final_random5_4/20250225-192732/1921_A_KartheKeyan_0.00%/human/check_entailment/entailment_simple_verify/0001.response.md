### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners.
   - The square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, and the coordinates are given in no particular order.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`n`).
   - For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners.
   - It sorts the coordinates, but this sorting might not be necessary for finding the side length of the square.
   - The code calculates the distances between pairs of points to find the side length of the square.

3. **Key Points to Verify:**
   - The distance calculation should be correct.
   - The side length of the square can be found by calculating the Euclidean distance between two adjacent corners.
   - The area of the square is the side length squared.

4. **Detailed Analysis:**
   - The code calculates the distances `p1` and `p2` between specific pairs of points.
   - `p1` is calculated between the second and first points, and `p2` is calculated between the fourth and third points.
   - These points are chosen arbitrarily, but since the square's sides are parallel to the axes, any pair of adjacent points will give the same side length.
   - The side length is then calculated as `sqrt(p1)` or `sqrt(p2)`, and the area is `res = abs(sqrt(p1) * sqrt(p2))`.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The code assumes that the side length is the same for all pairs of adjacent points, which is true for a square.
   - However, the code could be simplified by directly calculating the side length from any two adjacent points.
   - The current implementation might not handle all possible permutations of the coordinates correctly, especially if the coordinates are not in a consistent order.

6. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic for calculating the side length and area is correct.
   - The code handles multiple test cases as expected.
   - However, the code does not ensure that the points are correctly identified as adjacent, which might lead to incorrect results if the coordinates are not in a consistent order.

### Conclusion:
The given code correctly implements the solution to the problem in terms of mathematical correctness. However, the code does not ensure that the points are correctly identified as adjacent, which might lead to incorrect results if the coordinates are not in a consistent order. Therefore, the code is not robust enough to handle all possible input permutations.

**Correctness: False**
