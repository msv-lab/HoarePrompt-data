`n` is decremented by 1. Initially, `n` is not specified, but since it is not defined elsewhere, we assume it is being used in a context where it should be an integer. After decrementing, the value of `n` is now `n-1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 4, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing four tuples `[('4', 'input integer'), ('input integer', 'input integer'), ('x', 'y'), ('input integer', 'input integer')], `p2` is (input integer - y), `res` is abs(sqrt(input integer - y) * sqrt(abs((x - 4))), `n` is `n-1`.

Output State: **`i` is 4, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing four tuples `[('4', 'input integer'), ('input integer', 'input integer'), ('x', 'y'), ('input integer', 'input integer')], `p2` is (input integer - y), `res` is abs(sqrt(input integer - y) * sqrt(abs((x - 4))), `n` is `n-1`.**
