Output State: `i` is 3, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `coord` is a list containing tuples of 4 input integers and their corresponding 4 input integers, `p2` is `x - y`, `res` is 0.

Explanation: After the loop completes all 4 iterations, the variable `i` will be 3 because the loop increments `i` from 0 to 3. The variables `x` and `y` will hold the values of the most recent input pair since they are reassigned in each iteration. The list `coord` will contain tuples of all input pairs provided during the 4 iterations of the loop. The variable `p2` is calculated as `x - y` for the most recent input pair, and `res` remains 0 as it is not affected by the loop body.
