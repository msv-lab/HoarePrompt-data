Functionality: **The function processes up to four sets of coordinates representing the corners of squares. For each set, it calculates the area of the square formed by these coordinates and prints the result. After processing all sets, it outputs the final calculated area and ensures that the loop counter `n` is reduced to 0. The function does not return any value but modifies variables like `coord`, `p1`, `p2`, and `res` to reflect the last processed square's properties.**
