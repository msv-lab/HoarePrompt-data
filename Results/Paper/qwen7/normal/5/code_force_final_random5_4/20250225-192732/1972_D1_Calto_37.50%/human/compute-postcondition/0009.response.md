Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, m)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `m`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `cnt` is 2
   - `i` is 2
   - `m` must be greater than 1
   - `x` is `n - 3`
   - `y` is 4

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `m`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - Therefore, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - Since `i` is now 3, `m` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `cnt` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` is incremented to 3.
   - `m` must be greater than 3.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `cnt` is still 2.
   - `i` is now 3.
   - `m` must be greater than 3.
   - `x` is `n - 3` and does not change.
   - `y` is still 4.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`cnt` is 2, `i` is 3, `m` must be greater than 3, `x` is `n - 3`, `y` is 4**
