Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not address the core requirement of counting ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

- `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, which is not used in the problem.
- `func_2` appears to be an attempt to solve the problem but does not correctly implement the logic required. It seems to be attempting to count pairs based on a specific formula involving squares, which is not relevant to the problem statement.

To verify this, consider the following test case:
- Input: \(n = 2\), \(m = 3\)

Expected output: 3 (as mentioned in the example output).

However, running the provided code with this input will not produce the correct result. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
