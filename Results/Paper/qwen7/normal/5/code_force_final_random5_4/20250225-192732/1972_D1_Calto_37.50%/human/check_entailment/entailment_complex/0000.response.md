Reasoning:
Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Function 1 (`func_1`):
This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. This part is correct and works as expected.

### Function 2 (`func_2`):
The function `func_2` is supposed to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

However, the implementation in `func_2` is incorrect. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Loop Logic**: The loop iterates from 1 to \(m-1\). For each \(i\), it calculates \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\). These calculations do not relate to the problem constraints directly.

2. **Condition Check**: The condition `a + b` is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not checked properly. The logic inside the loop does not correctly count the valid pairs \((a, b)\).

3. **Return Value**: The function always returns 1, which is incorrect. The function should return the count of valid pairs, not a constant value.

Given the problem statement and the provided example outputs, the function should iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition for each pair. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
from math import gcd

def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt
```

### Conclusion:
The provided implementation of `func_2` does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
