### Reasoning

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why the given program is incorrect and re-evaluate it based on the problem statement and the provided annotations.

#### Problem Statement Recap

We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Function `func_1`

This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to compute the GCD of two numbers. This part is correct and efficient.

#### Function `func_2`

The function `func_2` is intended to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. However, the implementation is flawed:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of \(x\) and \(y\)**:
   - The expressions \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\) do not align with the problem requirements. These expressions are not related to the GCD condition or the problem constraints.

2. **Logic for Counting Valid Pairs**:
   - The loop iterates through values of \(i\) from 1 to \(m-1\), but it does not correctly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it seems to be trying to count something else, likely related to squares, which is not relevant to the problem.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function returns 1 if `cnt` is 0, but this does not handle the case where no valid pairs exist properly. The function should return 0 in such cases.

#### Detailed Analysis

- **Incorrect Calculation**: The expressions for \(x\) and \(y\) are not derived from the problem constraints. They do not help in determining the valid pairs \((a, b)\).
- **Incorrect Logic**: The loop does not correctly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The current logic is not aligned with the problem requirements.
- **Return Value**: The function always returns 1 if `cnt` is 0, which is incorrect. It should return 0 if no valid pairs are found.

### Conclusion

Based on the detailed analysis, the given program does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
