Output State: **`cnt` is 2, `i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 1, `x` is `n - 3`, `y` is 4**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `cnt` is 1, `i` is 2, `m` must be greater than 1, `x` is `n - 3`, and `y` is 4.
- The code updates `cnt` to `cnt + x // y + (i > 1)`.
  - `x` is `n - 3`.
  - `y` is 4.
  - `i > 1` evaluates to `True`, so `(i > 1)` is 1.
  - `x // y` is `(n - 3) // 4`.
  - Since `n - 3` is not specified, we keep it as `n - 3`.
- Therefore, `cnt` becomes `1 + (n - 3) // 4 + 1`.
- Simplifying, `cnt` becomes `2 + (n - 3) // 4`.
- Given the initial values, `cnt` is updated to 2 (assuming `n - 3` does not affect the integer division result in this context).
- All other variables remain unchanged.
