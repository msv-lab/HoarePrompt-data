### Reasoning

The original assessment concluded that the function `func_2` is incorrect because it uses an incorrect calculation for \(x\) and \(y\) and does not properly implement the required logic. Let's re-evaluate the function based on the problem description and the provided function summary.

#### Re-evaluation of Function `func_2`

1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The function iterates through values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m-1\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates \(x\) and \(y\) as follows:
     - \(x = n - (i * i - i)\)
     - \(y = i * i\)
   - It then increments the count `cnt` by \(x // y + (i > 1)\).

2. **Function Summary**:
   - The summary states that the function always returns 1 regardless of the input values. This is incorrect because the function should count valid pairs, not always return 1.

3. **Problem Description Analysis**:
   - The problem requires checking the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).
   - The current implementation does not check this condition at all.

Given the function summary, the function indeed always returns 1, which is incorrect. The function should count the valid pairs based on the given conditions, not always return 1.

### Final Evaluation

Since the function `func_2` does not correctly implement the required logic and always returns 1, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
