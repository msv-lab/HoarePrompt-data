Output State: **`cnt` is 1, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 1, `x` is `n - 1`, `y` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `cnt` is initialized and updated by the expression `cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)`. Given the initial state, `cnt` is initially 0, `x` is `n - 1`, `y` is 1, and `i` is 1. Since `i > 1` is false (`i` is 1), `(i > 1)` evaluates to 0. Thus, `cnt` is updated to `0 + (n - 1) // 1 + 0`, which simplifies to `n - 1`. However, since `cnt` starts at 0, it is updated to 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
