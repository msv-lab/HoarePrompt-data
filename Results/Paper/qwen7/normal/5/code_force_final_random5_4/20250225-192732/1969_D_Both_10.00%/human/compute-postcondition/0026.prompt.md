You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: main_ar is a list of pairs (a_i, b_i), where a_i and b_i are integers representing the prices for Alice and Bob respectively; sec_arr is a list of pairs (val_a, val_b) where val_a and val_b are integers.
def func_3(main_ar, sec_arr):
    sub_summ = 0
    for val_a in sec_arr:
        sub_summ += val_a[0]
        
    #State: Output State: `sub_summ'` is the sum of all elements `[val_a[0]]` in `sec_arr`, `sec_arr` is a non-empty list, `val_a` is the last element in `sec_arr`.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `sub_summ` will hold the sum of the first elements of all the sub-arrays (or lists) in `sec_arr`. The condition that `sec_arr` is a non-empty list remains true, and `val_a` will be the last sub-array processed in `sec_arr`.
    for val_b in main_ar:
        if val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0:
            sub_summ += val_b[0] + val_b[1]
        
    #State: `sub_summ` is the sum of `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` for all `val_b` in `main_ar` where `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`. `sec_arr` is a non-empty list, `val_a` is the last sub-array in `sec_arr`, and `main_ar` is empty.
    return sub_summ
    #The program returns sub_summ, which is the sum of val_b[0] + val_b[1] for all val_b in main_ar where val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `main_ar`, a list of pairs where each pair consists of two integers representing prices for Alice and Bob; and `sec_arr`, a list of pairs where each pair consists of two integers. It returns `sub_summ`, which is the sum of the second elements of all pairs in `main_ar` where the sum of the first elements of the pairs is greater than or equal to 0.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns sub_summ, which is the sum of val_b[0] + val_b[1] for all val_b in main_ar where val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
