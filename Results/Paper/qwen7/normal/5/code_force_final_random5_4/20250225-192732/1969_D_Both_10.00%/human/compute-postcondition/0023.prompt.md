Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `sub_summ'` is the sum of all elements `[val_a[0]]` in `sec_arr`, `sec_arr` is a non-empty list, `val_a` is the last element in `sec_arr`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `sub_summ` will hold the sum of the first elements of all the sub-arrays (or lists) in `sec_arr`. The condition that `sec_arr` is a non-empty list remains true, and `val_a` will be the last sub-array processed in `sec_arr`.
Code of the loop:
for val_b in main_ar:
    if val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0:
        sub_summ += val_b[0] + val_b[1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `sub_summ` is 0, `sec_arr` is a non-empty list, `val_a` is the last sub-array in `sec_arr`. If the sum of the first two elements of `val_b` is greater than or equal to 0, then `sub_summ` is equal to the sum of the first two elements of `val_b`. Otherwise, the values of `sub_summ`, `sec_arr`, and `val_a` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `sub_summ` is either 0 (if `val_b[0] + val_b[1] < 0`) or `0 + val_b[0] + val_b[1]` (if `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`). `sec_arr` is a non-empty list, `val_a` is the last sub-array in `sec_arr`, and `val_b` is the next element in `main_ar`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `sub_summ` is either `0` (if `val_b[0] + val_b[1] < 0`) or `0 + val_b[0] + val_b[1]` (if `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`), `sec_arr` is a non-empty list, `val_a` is the last sub-array in `sec_arr`, `val_b` is the next element in `main_ar`, and `main_ar` must have at least one element left. If `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`, then `sub_summ` is updated to `sub_summ + val_b[0] + val_b[1]`. Otherwise, `sub_summ` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
