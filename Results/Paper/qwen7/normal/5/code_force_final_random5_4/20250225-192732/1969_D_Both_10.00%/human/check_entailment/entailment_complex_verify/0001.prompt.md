You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game in the shop. There are n items in the shop;
each item has two parameters: a_i (item price for Alice) and b_i (item price
for Bob).

Alice wants to choose a subset (possibly empty) of items and buy them. After
that, Bob does the following:

  * if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free; 
  * otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which k items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay b_i for the i -th item. 

Alice's profit is equal to \sum\limits_{i \in S} b_i - \sum\limits_{j \in T}
a_j , where S is the set of items Bob buys from Alice, and T is the set of
items Alice buys from the shop. In other words, Alice's profit is the
difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends buying
the items.

Alice wants to maximize her profit, Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit. Your
task is to calculate Alice's profit if both Alice and Bob act optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ; 0 \le k \le n ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases doesn't
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — Alice's profit if both Alice and
Bob act optimally.

Output

Note

In the first test case, Alice should buy the 2 -nd item and sell it to Bob, so
her profit is 2 - 1 = 1 .

In the second test case, Alice should buy the 1 -st, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd
item; then Bob takes the 1 -st item for free and pays for the 2 -nd and the 3
-rd item. Alice's profit is (3+2) - (1+2+1) = 1 . Bob could take 2 -nd item
for free instead; this does not change Alice's profit. Bob won't take the 3
-rd item for free, since this would lead to a profit of 2 .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases defined by the integer `t`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program uses `func_1` and `func_2` to read input.
   - `func_1` reads an integer.
   - `func_2` reads multiple integers separated by spaces and returns them as a tuple.
   
2. **Main Function:**
   - The main function seems to be missing and is not defined in the provided code snippet.
   - The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are placeholders for reading input, but they are not used in the logic to solve the problem.

3. **Function 3:**
   - `func_3` takes two arrays, `main_ar` and `sec_arr`.
   - It calculates the sum of elements in `sec_arr` (`sub_summ`).
   - It iterates through `main_ar` and adds `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` to `sub_summ` if `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`.

### Problem Understanding:
- Alice wants to maximize her profit.
- Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit.
- If Alice buys less than `k` items, Bob takes all items for free.
- If Alice buys `k` or more items, Bob takes `k` items for free and Alice pays for the remaining items.

### Correct Approach:
- Alice should choose the items with the highest difference `b_i - a_i` to maximize her profit.
- Bob will choose the `k` most expensive items (from Alice's perspective) to minimize Alice's profit.

### Issues in the Given Code:
1. **Missing Main Logic:**
   - The main logic to solve the problem is not present in the given code.
   - The function `func_3` does not seem to implement the required logic.

2. **Incorrect Calculation:**
   - The function `func_3` sums up values without considering the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob.
   - It does not handle the scenario where Bob takes `k` items for free.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
