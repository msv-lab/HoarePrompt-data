Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for val_b in main_ar:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `val_b` and `main_ar`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `main_ar` to iterate over.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `sub_summ`: Either 0 or `0 + val_b[0] + val_b[1]` depending on the condition.
   - `sec_arr`: A non-empty list.
   - `val_a`: The last sub-array in `sec_arr`.
   - `val_b`: The next element in `main_ar`.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `main_ar`, the next value of `val_b` will be the next element in `main_ar`.
   - The variable `main_ar` will lose its current last element because `val_b` is being consumed in each iteration.
   - The `sub_summ` value will depend on the new `val_b` and the condition `val_b[0] + val_b[1] < 0` or `>= 0`.

5. **New State**:
   - `sub_summ`: Will be updated based on the new `val_b`.
   - `sec_arr`: Remains the same since it is not affected by the loop head.
   - `val_a`: Remains the same since it is not affected by the loop head.
   - `val_b`: Becomes the next element in `main_ar`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the consumption of `val_b` from `main_ar` and the update of `sub_summ`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`sub_summ` is either 0 (if `val_b[0] + val_b[1] < 0`) or `0 + val_b[0] + val_b[1]` (if `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`), `sec_arr` is a non-empty list, `val_a` is the last sub-array in `sec_arr`, `val_b` is the next element in `main_ar`**.

However, since `val_b` is the next element in `main_ar`, and `main_ar` loses its last element, the state should reflect that `main_ar` now has one less element.

**Final Adjusted State**:
State: **`sub_summ` is either 0 (if `val_b[0] + val_b[1] < 0`) or `0 + val_b[0] + val_b[1]` (if `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`), `sec_arr` is a non-empty list, `val_a` is the last sub-array in `sec_arr`, `val_b` is the next element in `main_ar`, and `main_ar` must have at least one element left**.
