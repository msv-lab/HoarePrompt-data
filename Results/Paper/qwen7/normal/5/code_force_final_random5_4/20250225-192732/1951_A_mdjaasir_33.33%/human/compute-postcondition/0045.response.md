Output: **YES**

Explanation: The initial state does not provide any specific values for the variables `count`, `i`, `t`, or `n`. However, the `print` statement itself does not depend on these variables. It simply prints the string `'YES'`. Therefore, regardless of the values of the other variables, the output will be `'YES'`.
