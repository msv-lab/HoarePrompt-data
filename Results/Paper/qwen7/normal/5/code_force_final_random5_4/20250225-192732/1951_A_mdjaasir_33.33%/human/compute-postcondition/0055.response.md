Postcondition: `count` is the number of '1's in the input string `a`, `i` is incremented by 1, `t` remains unchanged, and `n` is an input integer. If the first '1' in the string `a` is followed by another '1', `count` remains the same as before the if-else block. Otherwise, `count` remains the same as before the if-else block.
