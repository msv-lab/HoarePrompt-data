Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input converted to an integer to the variable `n`. The initial conditions for `t`, `start`, `end`, and `i` remain unchanged.
