Output State: **`values[i]` is the initial value plus the sum of the integer values of all characters in the original string `i` converted to integers, `sum_value_digits` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**

This means that `sum_value_digits` has been reset to 0, while `values[i]` retains its previous value which is the initial value plus the sum of the integer values of all characters in the original string `i` converted to integers, and `i` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value.
