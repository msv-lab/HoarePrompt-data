Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `t` in the expression `range(t)`. This means `t` is the only variable that can be adjusted based on the loop condition.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` must be at least 200001.

3. **Determine the new state**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` was at least 200001 at the end of the previous iteration, it will still be greater than 0 at the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t`, which must still be at least 200001 for the loop to execute one more time.

**State: **`t` must be at least 200001**
