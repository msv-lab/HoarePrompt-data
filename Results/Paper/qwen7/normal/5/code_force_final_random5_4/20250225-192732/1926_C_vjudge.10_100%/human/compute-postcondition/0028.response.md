Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `x` which is iterating over each character in the string `i`.

2. **Understand the Loop Body**: The loop body is omitted, but we know that it processes each character `x` of the string `i` and likely contributes to updating some state.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `values[i]` is the initial value plus the sum of the integer values of all characters in the original string `i` converted to integers.
   - `sum_value_digits` is the sum of `int(x)`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each character in the string `i`, the next character `x` will be processed in the next iteration.
   - The state of `values[i]` will depend on the current value of `sum_value_digits` and the next character `x`.
   - The `sum_value_digits` will be updated by adding the integer value of the next character `x`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `values[i]` will remain the same as it is dependent on the entire string, not just the current character.
   - `sum_value_digits` will be updated by adding the integer value of the next character `x`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `values[i]` remains the same.
- `sum_value_digits` is updated by adding the integer value of the next character `x`.

Since the exact value of `x` is not known, we can represent the updated `sum_value_digits` as `sum_value_digits + int(next_x)` where `next_x` is the next character in the string `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`values[i]` is the initial value plus the sum of the integer values of all characters in the original string `i` converted to integers; `sum_value_digits` is the sum of `int(x)` plus the integer value of the next character `x`**.
