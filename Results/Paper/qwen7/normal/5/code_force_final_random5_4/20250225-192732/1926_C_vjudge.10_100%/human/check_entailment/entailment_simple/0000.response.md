Reasoning:
1. The program correctly initializes a list `values` of size `inf` (which is set to 200001) to store the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to each index.
2. It then iterates through each number from 1 to 200000, calculating the sum of its digits and updating the cumulative sum in the `values` list.
3. For each test case, the program reads the input `n` and prints the corresponding cumulative sum from the `values` list.
4. The logic for calculating the sum of digits and updating the cumulative sum is correct.
5. The program handles multiple test cases efficiently by precomputing the cumulative sums up to 200000, which fits within the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test case.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
