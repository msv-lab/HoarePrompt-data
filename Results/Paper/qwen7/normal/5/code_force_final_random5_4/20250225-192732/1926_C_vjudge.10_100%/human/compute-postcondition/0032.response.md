Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all its iterations will be `values[i]` equal to the initial value plus the sum of the integer values of all characters in the original string `i` converted to integers; `sum_value_digits` will be the total sum of all integer values of each character in the string `i`.

In Natural Language: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the value of `values[i]` will be the initial value plus the sum of the integer values of all characters in the original string `i` when each character is converted to an integer. The variable `sum_value_digits` will hold the cumulative sum of the integer values of all characters in the string `i`.
