Output State: The final state of `values` will be a list where each index `i` (from 0 to 200000) contains the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i`. In other words, `values[i]` will hold the sum of the digit sums of all integers from 1 to `i`. This means that for each index `i` in the `values` list, it will store the result of summing the digits of all numbers from 1 up to `i`.

For example, `values[1]` will be 1 (since the digit sum of 1 is 1), `values[2]` will be 3 (since the digit sum of 1+2 is 3), `values[3]` will be 6 (since the digit sum of 1+2+3 is 6), and so on, until `values[200000]`, which will be the sum of the digit sums of all numbers from 1 to 200000.
