Output State: **`values[i]` is the initial value plus the sum of the integer values of all characters in the original string `i` converted to integers; `sum_value_digits` is the sum of `int(x)` plus the integer value of the next character `x`, and `sum_value_digits` is increased by the integer value of `x`.**

Explanation: The code `sum_value_digits += int(x)` increments `sum_value_digits` by the integer value of `x`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
