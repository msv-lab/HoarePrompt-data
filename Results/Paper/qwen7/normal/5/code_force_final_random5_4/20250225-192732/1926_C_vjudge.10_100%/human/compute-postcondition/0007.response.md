Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in str(i):`. The variables involved here are `x` and `i`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`. In each iteration, `x` takes the value of one character from the string representation of `i`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `sum_value_digits` is increased by the integer value of `x`.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` is iterating through each character of `str(i)`, the next character in the string representation of `i` will be taken in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `x` will be the next character in the string representation of `i`.
   - The variable `i` itself does not change within the loop; it remains the same for each iteration.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `sum_value_digits` will be increased by the integer value of the next character in the string representation of `i`.
   - `x` will be the next character in the string representation of `i`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`sum_value_digits` is increased by the integer value of the next character in the string representation of `i`, `x` is the next character in the string representation of `i`**.
