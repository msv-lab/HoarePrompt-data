Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(t)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `t`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `t` is `n-1`.
   - `l` is 'NO'.
   - `c` is the input from the user.

3. **Determine the next state for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `t`.
   - Since `i` is currently equal to `n` and `t` is `n-1`, `i` cannot be less than `t` unless `n` is decreased by 1.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` should be set to `n-1` (since `i` was `n` and `t` is `n-1`).
   - `t` should be set to `n-2` (since `t` is `n-1` and it needs to be decremented by 1 for the loop to execute again).

5. **Keep other states unchanged**: The states of `l` and `c` remain the same as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is `n-1`, `t` is `n-2`, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is 'NO', `c` is the input from the user**.
