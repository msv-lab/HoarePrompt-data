Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `t` is `n-2`, `n` is an input integer, `l` is 'NO', `b` is an input from the user**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the input to the variable `b`. All other variables remain unchanged. The initial state of `i` is `n-1`, `t` is `n-2`, `n` is an input integer, `l` is 'NO', and `a` is the input from the user. After executing `b = input()`, `b` now holds the value of the new input provided by the user.
