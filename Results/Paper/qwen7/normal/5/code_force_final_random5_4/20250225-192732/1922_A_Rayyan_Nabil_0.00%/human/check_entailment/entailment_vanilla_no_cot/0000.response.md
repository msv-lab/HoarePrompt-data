Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in how it determines if a template exists. Specifically:

- The program sets `l` to `'YES'` initially.
- It then iterates through each character of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- If both `a[i]` and `b[i]` do not equal `c[i]`, it sets `l` to `'YES'`. However, this logic is flawed because it should check if there is any character where `a[i]` and `b[i]` match but `c[i]` does not.
- Instead, the program should check if there is at least one position where `a[i]` and `b[i]` match but `c[i]` does not. If such a position is found, `l` should remain `'YES'`. If no such position is found after checking all characters, `l` should be set to `'NO'`.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        
        # Check if there exists a template that matches a and b but not c
        valid_template = True
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i] and a[i] != c[i]:
                continue
            elif a[i] != b[i] and a[i] == c[i]:
                valid_template = False
                break
            elif a[i] != b[i] and b[i] == c[i]:
                valid_template = False
                break
            elif a[i] == b[i] and b[i] == c[i]:
                valid_template = False
                break
        
        if valid_template:
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly checks if there exists a template that matches `a` and `b` but not `c`.
