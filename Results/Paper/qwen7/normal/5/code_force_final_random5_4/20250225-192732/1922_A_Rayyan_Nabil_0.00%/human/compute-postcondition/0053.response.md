Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined as `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-1`, meaning `i` is already at its maximum value (`n-1`).

3. **Adjust the states based on the loop head**:
   - Since `i` is `n-1`, incrementing `i` by 1 would make it `n`, which is not less than `n`. Therefore, the loop will not execute again.
   - However, we still need to update the state of `i` to reflect the next value it would take if the loop were to continue.

4. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented to `n` (since `i` was `n-1`).
   - `n` remains unchanged as there is no modification to `n` within the loop head itself.

5. **Construct the new state**:
   - `i` is now `n`.
   - `t` remains `n-2` as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` remains greater than 0.
   - `l` is 'YES' and does not change.
   - `b` and `c` remain as inputs from the user and do not change.
   - The condition that the current value of `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and the current value of `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` does not apply since `i` is `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which won't actually occur) would be:

State: **`i` is `n`, `t` is `n-2`, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is 'YES', `b` is an input from the user, `c` is an input from the user**.
