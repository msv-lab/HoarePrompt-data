Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `t` is `n-1`, `l` is 'YES', `c` is the input from the user, and `l` is 'YES'**.

Explanation: The line `l = 'YES'` does not change the value of `l`. It simply reassigns the value of `l` to `'YES'`, which was already its value. All other variables remain unchanged.
