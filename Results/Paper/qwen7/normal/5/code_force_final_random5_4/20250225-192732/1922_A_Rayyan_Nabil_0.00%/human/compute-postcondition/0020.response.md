Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `n` must be greater than or equal to the final value of `i` (which would be `n-1`), `i` is `n-1`, and `l` will be 'YES' if for every `i` from 0 to `n-1`, both `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`. If any condition fails (i.e., if `a[i]` equals `c[i]` or `b[i]` equals `c[i]` for any `i`), `l` remains 'NO'.
