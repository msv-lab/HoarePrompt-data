Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `t` is `n-2`, `n` is an input integer, `l` is 'NO', `c` is the input from the user**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input to the variable `n`. The values of `i`, `t`, `l`, and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states. The initial state of `n` being `n-1` is updated to the actual input value converted to an integer.
