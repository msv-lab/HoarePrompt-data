Output State: **`i` is `n`, `t` is `n-1`, `l` is 'YES' if for every index `j` from 0 to `n-1`, both `a[j]` is not equal to `c[j]` and `b[j]` is not equal to `c[j]' and a string `a` is input from the user.**

Explanation: The code `a = input()` reads a string from the user input and assigns it to the variable `a`. The values of `i`, `t`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial state. The condition for `l` to be 'YES' or 'NO' is not affected by this input, so it retains its initial description.
