Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `n` must be greater than or equal to the number of iterations executed.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `l` is 'YES' if for every index `j` from 0 to `n-1`, both `a[j]` is not equal to `c[j]` and `b[j]` is not equal to `c[j]`.
- `l` remains 'NO' if there exists any index `j` where either `a[j]` equals `c[j]` or `b[j]` equals `c[j]`.

### Loop Head
The loop head is defined as:
```python
for i in range(t):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Variable `i`**: The loop starts with `i = 0` and increments `i` by 1 at each iteration. Since the loop ends when `i` reaches `n-1`, the loop will execute `n` times.
2. **Variable `t`**: The variable `t` is the number of iterations the loop will execute. Initially, `t` is set to `n`.

### Adjusting States
- **`i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-1`. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it `n`.
- **`t`**: Since the loop will execute one more time, `t` will be decremented by 1, making it `n-1`.

### Conditions for `l`
- `l` is 'YES' if for every index `j` from 0 to `n-1`, both `a[j]` is not equal to `c[j]` and `b[j]` is not equal to `c[j]`.
- `l` remains 'NO' if there exists any index `j` where either `a[j]` equals `c[j]` or `b[j]` equals `c[j]`.

Since the loop will execute one more time, the condition for `l` will remain the same unless the loop body changes the values of `a`, `b`, or `c` in such a way that the condition for `l` is violated.

### Final State
- `i` will be `n`.
- `t` will be `n-1`.
- The condition for `l` will remain the same unless the loop body changes the values of `a`, `b`, or `c`.

### State at the Start of the Next Iteration
State: **`i` is `n`, `t` is `n-1`, and `l` is 'YES' if for every index `j` from 0 to `n-1`, both `a[j]` is not equal to `c[j]` and `b[j]` is not equal to `c[j]`. If there exists any index `j` where either `a[j]` equals `c[j]` or `b[j]` equals `c[j]`, then `l` remains 'NO'.**
