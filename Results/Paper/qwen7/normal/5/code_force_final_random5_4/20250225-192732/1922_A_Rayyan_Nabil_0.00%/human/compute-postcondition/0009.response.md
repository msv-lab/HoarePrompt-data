Output State: **`l` is 'YES', `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, the current value of `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, and the current value of `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`**.

The code assigns the string `'YES'` to the variable `l`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `a[i]`, `b[i]`, and `c[i]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
