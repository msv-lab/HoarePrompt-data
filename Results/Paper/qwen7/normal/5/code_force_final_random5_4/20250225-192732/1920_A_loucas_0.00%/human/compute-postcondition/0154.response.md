Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i`, `max(big)`, and `min(less)`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range defined by `max(big)` and `min(less)`. This means `i` must be less than `min(less)` but greater than or equal to `max(big)`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**: 
   - `max(big)` must be less than `min(less)`
   - `i` is not in `no`
   - If `i` is not in `no`, we break out of the loop

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop condition depends on `i`, `max(big)`, and `min(less)`, these are the only variables we need to consider.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (assuming it was `i = max(big)` at the start of the current iteration).
   - `max(big)` and `min(less)` remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them, but since no such modification is mentioned, they stay the same.

5. **Final State**:
   - `i` will be `max(big) + 1`
   - `max(big)` remains the same
   - `min(less)` remains the same
   - The condition `max(big) < min(less)` still holds true
   - The check `if i not in no` will be true for the new value of `i`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`max(big)` must be less than `min(less)`, and `i` must be `max(big) + 1`**
