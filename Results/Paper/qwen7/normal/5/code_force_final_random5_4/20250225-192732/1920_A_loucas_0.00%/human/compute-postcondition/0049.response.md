Postcondition: `less` contains at least one element, `big` contains at least one element, `max(big)` is greater than or equal to `min(less)`, and `i` is `max(big) + 1`. If `i` is not in `no`, then `num` is set to `max(big) + 1` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `i` is in `no`, the condition remains unchanged.
