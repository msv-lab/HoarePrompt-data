Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `max(big)` must be less than `min(less)`
   - `i` is `max(big) + 1`
   - The condition for breaking out of the loop is if `i` is not in `no`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for values of `i` in the range from `max(big)` to `min(less)`.

3. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The only variables in the loop head are `i`.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `max(big) + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `min(less)`.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, the next value of `i` would be `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, the new value of `i` will be `(max(big) + 1) + 1 = max(big) + 2`.

6. **State Adjustment:**
   - We need to ensure that `i` is still within the range defined by the loop condition, i.e., `max(big) <= i < min(less)`.
   - Given that `i` was `max(big) + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` should be `max(big) + 2`.

7. **Final State:**
   - The state needs to reflect the updated value of `i` and maintain the condition that `max(big)` must be less than `min(less)`.
   - The state also needs to indicate that `i` is now `max(big) + 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`max(big)` must be less than `min(less)`, and `i` is `max(big) + 2`**.
