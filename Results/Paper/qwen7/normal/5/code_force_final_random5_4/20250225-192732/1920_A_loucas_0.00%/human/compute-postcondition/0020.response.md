Postcondition: `loop` is an integer between 1 and 500, inclusive, `iterable` is 0, `less` is either a list containing the input integer `a` or an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is either an empty list or a list containing `[a]`, `num` is 0, `x` is an input integer, and `a` is an input integer. If `x` equals 2, `less` contains `a`; otherwise, `no` contains `[a]`.
