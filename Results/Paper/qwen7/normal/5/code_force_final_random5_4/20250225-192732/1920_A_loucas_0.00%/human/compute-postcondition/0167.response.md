Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of constraints defined within its scope. It returns a value based on the constraints provided, which include an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases, an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) for each test case, and n lines of constraints where each line contains two integers a and x (a ∈ {1, 2, 3}, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9). The function ensures there is at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, and all constraints are unique.**
