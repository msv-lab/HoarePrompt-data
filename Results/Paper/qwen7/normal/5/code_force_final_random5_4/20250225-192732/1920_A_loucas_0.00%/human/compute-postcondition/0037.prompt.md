Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `loop` must be an integer between 1 and 500, inclusive, `iterable` is 0, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
    x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x == 1:
        big.append(a)
    elif x == 2:
        less.append(a)
    else:
        no.append(a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `loop` is an integer between 1 and 500, inclusive, `iterable` is 0, `less` is either a list containing the input integer `a` or an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is either an empty list or a list containing `[a]`, `num` is 0, `x` is an input integer, and `a` is an input integer. If `x` equals 1, `big` contains `a`; otherwise, `no` contains `[a]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `loop` is an integer between 1 and 500, inclusive, `iterable` is 1, `less` is either a list containing the input integer `a` once or twice, `big` is a list containing the input integer `a`, `no` is either an empty list or a list containing `[a]`, `num` is 0, `x` is the first input integer, and `a` is the second input integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `loop` is an integer between 1 and 500, inclusive; `iterable` is 1; `less` is either a list containing the input integer `a` once or twice plus the input integer `a`, or a list containing the input integer `a` once or twice; `big` is a list containing the input integer `a` twice; `no` is either an empty list or a list containing `[a]`; `num` is 0; `x` is the first input integer; `a` is the second input integer; `iterable2` is 1; `innerLoop` is the same as before; `x` is the first input integer (converted to int); `a` is the second input integer (converted to int.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
