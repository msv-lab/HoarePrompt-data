Output State: **`less` contains at least one element, `big` contains at least one element, `max(big)` is greater than or equal to `min(less)`, and `i` is `max(big) + 1`, `num` is `max(big) + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. All the initial conditions remain the same.
