Postcondition: **`loop` is an integer between 1 and 500, inclusive; `iterable` is 1; `less` is either a list containing the input integer `a` once or twice plus the input integer `a`, or a list containing the input integer `a` once or twice; `big` is a list containing the input integer `a` twice; `no` is either an empty list or a list containing `[a]`; `num` is 0; `x` is the first input integer; `a` is the second input integer; `iterable2` is 1; `innerLoop` is the same as before; `x` is the first input integer (converted to int); `a` is the second input integer (converted to int.**
