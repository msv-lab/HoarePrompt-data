State: **`loop` must be an integer between 1 and 500, inclusive, iterable is 0** 

Explanation:
- The loop variable `iterable` starts at 0 and increments with each iteration.
- For the loop to execute, `loop` must be a positive integer because `range(loop)` generates numbers from 0 up to, but not including, `loop`.
- Since `loop` is given as an input integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), it needs to be confirmed that `loop` is within this range.
- Initially, `iterable` is set to 0, which is the starting point of the `range` function.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect these conditions.
