Output State: **`i` is `min(less) + 1`, `max(big)` remains less than `min(less)`, `num` is `min(less) + 1`, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `no = []` creates an empty list named `no`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `max(big)`, `num`, or `big`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
