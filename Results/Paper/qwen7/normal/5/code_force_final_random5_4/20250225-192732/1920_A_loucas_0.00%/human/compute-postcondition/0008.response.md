Output State: **`loop` must be an integer between 1 and 500, inclusive, `iterable` is 0, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list, `num` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer.**

The code `x, a = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
