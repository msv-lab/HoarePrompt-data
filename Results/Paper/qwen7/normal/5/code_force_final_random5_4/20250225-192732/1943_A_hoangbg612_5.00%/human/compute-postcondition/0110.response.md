Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` and the condition `range(cur)`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `cur`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `cur`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `cur` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop continues as long as `i < cur`, the next value of `i` will be 1 (assuming `cur` remains unchanged).
   - `cur` remains the same because it is not modified within the loop body and its value is not dependent on the loop itself.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`cur` is greater than 0, `i` is 1**
