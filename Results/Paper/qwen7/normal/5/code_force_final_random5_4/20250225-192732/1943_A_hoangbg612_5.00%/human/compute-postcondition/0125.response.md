Output State: **`cur` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `T` is 3, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `N = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers from the user input, converts each integer to a string, and then maps them to integers, storing the resulting list in the variable `N`. The values of `cur`, `i`, `T`, and `S` remain unchanged from their initial states.
