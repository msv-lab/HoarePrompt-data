Output State: **All elements in `N` have been processed, and `cur` is set to the last element of `N`. For every unique element in `N`, `M` contains the frequency of that element.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `cur` will be set to the last element of the list `N`. The dictionary `M` will map each unique element in `N` to its frequency count. No further changes to `cur` or `M` will occur since the loop condition (`num > cur`) will no longer be satisfied once `cur` equals the last element in `N`.
