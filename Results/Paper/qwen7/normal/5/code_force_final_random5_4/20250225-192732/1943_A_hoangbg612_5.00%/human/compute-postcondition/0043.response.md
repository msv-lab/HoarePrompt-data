Postcondition: **`cur` will hold the last valid update or remain -1, `T` and `S` will stay as initially provided, `N` will be empty, and `M` will map each relevant element to its frequency in `N`. The sum of the counts in the dictionary `M` will equal the initial value of `S` if the condition in the if statement is true. Otherwise, `cur` will remain as it is, `T` and `S` will stay as initially provided, `N` will be empty, and `M` will map each relevant element to its frequency in `N`.**
