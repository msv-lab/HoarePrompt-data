### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the size of the array `N` and the elements of the array.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `N` is sorted, which is unnecessary for determining the MEX but might be intended for some other purpose.

3. **Initialization:**
   - A variable `cur` is initialized to -1.
   - A dictionary `M` is used to keep track of the counts of each number in the array.

4. **Populating the Dictionary:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted array and updates the dictionary `M`.
   - If a number `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is more than `cur + 1`. If so, it increments `cur` and breaks out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, it increments the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M`.

5. **Final MEX Calculation:**
   - After populating the dictionary, the program checks if the sum of the counts in `M` equals the size of the array `S`.
   - If they are equal, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - Then, it iterates through the keys in `M` to find the largest key `i` such that `M[i] <= i`. This key is set as the final value of `cur`.

6. **Output:**
   - Finally, the program prints `cur`, which should be the MEX of the array `c`.

### Issues Identified:
- The logic for determining the MEX is flawed. The program incorrectly assumes that the MEX can be determined by the counts of numbers in the sorted array.
- The program does not handle the optimal strategies for Alice and Bob as described in the problem statement.
- The program does not account for the fact that Alice and Bob play optimally, meaning Alice will try to maximize the MEX, and Bob will try to minimize it.

### Correct Solution:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to simulate the game according to the optimal strategies of both players:
- Alice will always pick the smallest available number to maximize the MEX.
- Bob will always pick the smallest available number to minimize the MEX.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        mex = 0
        for num in N:
            if num == mex:
                mex += 1
            elif num > mex:
                break
        
        print(mex)

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not follow the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Therefore, the answer is:

**Correctness: **False**
