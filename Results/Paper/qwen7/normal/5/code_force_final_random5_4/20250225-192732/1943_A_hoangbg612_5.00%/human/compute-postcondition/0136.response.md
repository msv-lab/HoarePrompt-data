Output State: **`cur` is equal to `num`, `i` is 2, `T` is 3, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty list of sorted integers, `M` is an empty dictionary, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code `cur = num` simply assigns the value of `num` to `cur`. All other variables remain unchanged.
