Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(cur)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `cur`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < cur`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `cur` is greater than 0, and `i` is 1.

3. **Calculate the new value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

4. **Determine the new value of `cur`**:
   - The value of `cur` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body. Since no modification to `cur` is mentioned, `cur` remains the same as its value at the end of the previous iteration.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `cur`.
   - Given that `i` is now 1 and `cur` is greater than 0, the condition `i < cur` will hold true if `cur` is greater than 1.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, so `i` will be 2.
   - `cur` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`cur` is greater than 0, `i` is 2**
