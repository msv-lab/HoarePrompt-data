Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(cur)`. The key variables here are `i` and `cur`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < cur`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `M` is a list of integers.
   - `cur` is equal to `i`.
   - The index `i` is within the bounds of `M`.
   - The value at index `i` of `M` is less than or equal to `i`.
   - We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues based on `i < cur`, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` must have been incremented by 1 (because the loop body was executed).
   - Therefore, `i` will now be `cur - 1` (since it was equal to `cur` at the start of the previous iteration and was incremented by 1).

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be `cur - 1`.
   - `cur` remains the same as it was not modified within the loop.

6. **Ensure the new state satisfies the loop condition**: For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `cur`. Since `i` is now `cur - 1`, this condition is satisfied.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`M` is a list of integers, `cur` is equal to `i + 1`, the index `i` is within the bounds of `M`, and the value at index `i` of `M` is less than or equal to `i`**.

However, since `cur` is the variable that controls the loop, and it remains unchanged, we can simplify this to:

State: **`M` is a list of integers, `cur` is equal to `i + 1`, the index `i` is within the bounds of `M`, and the value at index `i` of `M` is less than or equal to `i`**.

But to strictly follow the format and ensure clarity:

State: **`M` is a list of integers, `cur` is equal to `i + 1`, the index `i` is within the bounds of `M`, and the value at index `i` of `M` is less than or equal to `i`**.

This ensures that the loop can continue as `i` is now `cur - 1` and the condition `i < cur` is still true.
