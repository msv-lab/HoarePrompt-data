Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer \( T \) (the number of test cases), followed by a positive integer \( S \) and a list \( N \) of \( n \) non-negative integers. It then sorts the list \( N \) and iterates through it to determine the largest integer \( cur \) such that the count of numbers less than or equal to \( cur \) in \( N \) meets or exceeds \( S \). Finally, it prints the value of \( cur \).**
