Output State: **`cur` is the current value of `cur` plus 1, the current value of `num` is greater than the new value of `cur', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the value of `cur` has been incremented by 1, and the condition where `num` is greater than `cur` still holds true. Additionally, the code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was inside.
