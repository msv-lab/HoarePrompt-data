Output State: **`cur` is equal to `num`, `M[cur]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `M[cur] = 1` sets the value of `M[cur]` to 1. Initially, `M[cur]` was incremented by 1 if `num` was greater than `cur + 1`. However, now it is explicitly set to 1 regardless of the condition. The value of `cur` remains equal to `num` as no operation changes its value.
