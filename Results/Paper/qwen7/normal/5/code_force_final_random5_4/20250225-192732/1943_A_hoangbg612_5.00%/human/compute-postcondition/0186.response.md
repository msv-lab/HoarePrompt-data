Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of test cases, where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4), a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a list a of n non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i < n). For each test case, the function returns information about the list a based on the given conditions.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters, and for each test case, it processes a list of integers and returns some form of output based on the given constraints.
