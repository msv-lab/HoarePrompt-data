Postcondition: `M` is a list of integers, the index `i` is within the bounds of `M`, and if the value at index `i` of `M` is less than or equal to `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the value at index `i` of `M` is greater than `i`, no action is taken and the program continues as normal.
