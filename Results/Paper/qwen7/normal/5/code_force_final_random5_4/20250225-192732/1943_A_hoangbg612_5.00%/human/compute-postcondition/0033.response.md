Postcondition: `cur` is either -1 or equal to the next element in `N`, `T` is an integer between 1 and 20000 inclusive, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers where the next element is `next_num`, and `M` is a dictionary containing the key `cur` with value 1 if `cur` was updated, or the key `next_num` with value 1 if `cur` was -1 and updated. Additionally, if `num > cur + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
