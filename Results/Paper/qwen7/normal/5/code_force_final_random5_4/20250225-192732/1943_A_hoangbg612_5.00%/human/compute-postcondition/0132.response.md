Output State: **`cur` is now equal to `num`, `i` is 2, `T` is 3, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty list of sorted integers, `M` is an empty dictionary, `cur` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. Since `cur` was originally equal to `num`, after executing `cur += 1`, `cur` becomes equal to `num`. The other variables remain unchanged.
