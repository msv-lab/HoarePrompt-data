Output State: `cur` is greater than 0, `i` is 2.

Explanation: Based on the provided information, the loop continues to increment `i` from 0 until it either finds an index where `M[i]` is greater than `i` or reaches the value of `cur`. Since the loop has executed 3 times, `i` is now 2. The value of `cur` remains greater than 0 because the loop did not break out and change `cur` within those iterations. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `cur` will still be greater than 0 and `i` will be 2.
