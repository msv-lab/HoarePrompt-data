Output State: **`cur` is 0, `i` is 0**.

Explanation: The value of `cur` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 0. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0. The precondition that `cur` must be greater than 0 is no longer valid since `cur` is now 0. However, the initial value of the array `M[i]` being less than or equal to 0 is still valid.
