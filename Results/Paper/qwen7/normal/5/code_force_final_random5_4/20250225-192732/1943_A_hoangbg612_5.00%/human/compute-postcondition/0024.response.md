Postcondition: **`cur` is either -1 or equal to `next_num` (if `next_num > cur`), `T` is an integer between 1 and 20000 inclusive, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers where the next element is `next_num`, `M` is a dictionary containing the key `cur+1` with value 1 if `cur` was -1 before the increment, or the key `cur` with value 1 if `cur` was not -1 before the increment, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This postcondition summarizes that if `num > cur + 1`, then `cur` is incremented to `cur + 1` and the appropriate entry in the dictionary `M` is updated. If the condition is not met, `cur` remains unchanged and the dictionary `M` retains its previous state, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
