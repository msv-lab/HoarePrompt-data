Output State: `cur` is greater than 0, `i` is 2.

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `cur` remains greater than 0, and the value of `i` is 2. This implies that the loop did not break early because `M[i]` was less than or equal to `i` for any `i` from 0 to 2, and thus `cur` remained unchanged from its initial value.
