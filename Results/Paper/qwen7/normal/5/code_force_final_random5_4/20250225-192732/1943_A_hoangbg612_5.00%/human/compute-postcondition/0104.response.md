Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `cur`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `cur`**:
   - According to the given state before the loop starts, all elements in `N` have been processed.
   - `cur` is set to the last element of `N` plus 1 if the sum of frequencies in `M` equals `S`. Otherwise, `cur` remains the last element of `N`.

3. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < cur`.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute if `cur` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop depends on `cur`, we need to ensure that `cur` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - The initial value of `i` is 0 because the loop starts from `i = 0` and increments `i` in each iteration.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `cur` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is initially set to 0.

Therefore, the modified state should be:

**State: **`cur` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
