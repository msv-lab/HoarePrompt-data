Output State: **`cur` is the fourth element of `N`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `M[cur] += 1` increments the value of `M[cur]` by 1. Given the initial state, `M[cur]` was set to 1 if `num` was greater than `cur`, otherwise it was incremented by 1. After executing the code, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1. Therefore, `M[cur]` is now one more than its initial value.
