Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the next element in the list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is `x` and the value is 2**

Explanation: The code updates the count of `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens`. Initially, `num_of_lens[x]` is set to 1. After executing `num_of_lens[x] = num_of_lens.get(x, 0) + 1`, the value of `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
