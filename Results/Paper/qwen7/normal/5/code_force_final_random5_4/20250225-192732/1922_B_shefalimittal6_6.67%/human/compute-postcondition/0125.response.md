Output State: **`res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, `nums` remains a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` remains unchanged, `cnt` is set to the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`, and `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except `cnt` if `cnt` is not equal to the current value being iterated over.**

In this step, the value of `res` is updated by adding `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. The other variables remain in their initial states as specified, with `nums` and `num_of_lens` remaining unchanged, `cnt` being set to the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`, and `total_sum` being the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except `cnt` if `cnt` is not equal to the current value being iterated over.
