Output State: **`num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `nums` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `nums = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user and converts each element into an integer. These integers are then stored in the list `nums`. The variable `num_of_lens` remains unchanged as it was initially an empty dictionary. Therefore, the output state includes the updated `nums` list and the unchanged `num_of_lens` dictionary.
