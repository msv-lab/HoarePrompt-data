Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The value of `n` and the list `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    num_of_lens = {}
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for x in nums:
        num_of_lens[x] = num_of_lens.get(x, 0) + 1
    res = 0
    for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
        if cnt >= 3:
            res += math.comb(cnt, 3)
        if cnt >= 2:
            total_sum = sum(i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt)
            res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum
    print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The final value of `res` will be the sum of all `math.comb(cnt, 3)` for each `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` that is greater than or equal to 3, plus the sum of all `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` for each `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` that is greater than or equal to 2 but less than 3, where `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except the current `cnt`.

In simpler terms, `res` will accumulate the combinations of counts of each number in the dictionary `num_of_lens` based on the conditions specified in the loop. Specifically, it will add the combination of choosing 3 items from each count that has 3 or more occurrences, and the combination of choosing 2 items from each count that has 2 or 3 occurrences multiplied by the sum of all other counts.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, the `num_of_lens` dictionary will contain the count of each integer found in the `nums` list. The variable `res` will be the sum of:

- `math.comb(cnt, 3)` for each `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` where `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3.
- `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` for each `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` where `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, with `total_sum` being the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except for `cnt`.

In simpler terms, `res` will accumulate the combinatorial sums based on the counts of integers in `nums`, considering all possible combinations of 3 elements and pairs, as long as their counts meet the specified conditions. The `num_of_lens` dictionary will reflect the final count of each unique integer from the `nums` list after all iterations of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The final value of `res` will be the sum of all updates made to it during the loop executions. Specifically, for each unique integer `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` that appears 3 or more times, `res` will be increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. For each unique integer `cnt` that appears 2 or more times, `res` will be increased by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, where `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
