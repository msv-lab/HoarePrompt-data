Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `x` and `nums`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `nums` to iterate over.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `nums` is a non-empty list of integers.
   - `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the key is an integer from `nums` and the value is the count of occurrences of that integer.
   - `x` is the next element in the list `nums`.
   - The count of `x` in `num_of_lens` is incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` is the next element in `nums`, it means `nums` still contains elements to iterate over.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `nums` should still be a non-empty list.
   - `x` will now be the next element in `nums`.
   - The count of `x` in `num_of_lens` will be incremented by 1 again.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `nums` remains a non-empty list of integers.
   - `num_of_lens` remains a dictionary where the key is an integer from `nums` and the value is the count of occurrences of that integer.
   - `x` becomes the next element in `nums`.
   - The count of `x` in `num_of_lens` is incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`nums` is a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the key is an integer from `nums` and the value is the count of occurrences of that integer, and `x` is the next element in the list `nums`; the count of `x` in `num_of_lens` is incremented by 1**.
