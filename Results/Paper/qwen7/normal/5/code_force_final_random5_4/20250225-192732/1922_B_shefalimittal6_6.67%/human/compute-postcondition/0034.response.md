Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `cnt` and `num_of_lens.values()`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each value in `num_of_lens.values()`. The variable `cnt` takes on each value in this set during each iteration.

3. **Determine the postconditions for the next iteration**:
   - `cnt` will be the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.
   - `total_sum` will remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration because it is not updated within the loop body (it is only used in the calculation of `res`).

4. **Adjust the state based on the loop condition**:
   - Since `cnt` will be the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`, we need to determine what the next `cnt` will be.
   - `total_sum` remains unchanged.

Given the postcondition from the previous iteration, let's assume the following:
- `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.
- `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except the current `cnt`.

Since `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`, it means that the current `cnt` has already been processed, and the next `cnt` will be the next key-value pair in the dictionary.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.
- `total_sum` remains the same.

So, the adjusted state is:

State: **`cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except the current `cnt`**
