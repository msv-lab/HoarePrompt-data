Output State: **`num_of_lens` contains at least one key-value pair, `res` is increased by either `math.comb(cnt, 3)` (if `cnt` >= 3) or `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` (if `cnt` < 3), `total_sum` is now the sum of values in `num_of_lens.values()` excluding those equal to `cnt`, and `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`; `total_sum` is updated to sum of values in `num_of_lens.values()` excluding the current `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `total_sum` as the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except for the current value of `cnt`. This means that `total_sum` is now updated to reflect this new sum. All other conditions and relationships remain unchanged.
