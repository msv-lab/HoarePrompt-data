Output State: **`nums` is a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the key is an integer from `nums` and the value is the count of occurrences of that integer, and `x` is the next element in the list `nums`; the count of `x` in `num_of_lens` is incremented by 1**

Explanation: The code updates the count of `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens`. It does this by retrieving the current count of `x` (using `num_of_lens.get(x, 0)` which returns the value for `x` if it exists, otherwise 0), adding 1 to it, and then storing the result back into `num_of_lens` under the key `x`. The values of `nums` and `num_of_lens` remain unchanged except for the updated count of `x` in `num_of_lens`.
