Output State: **`num_of_lens` dictionary will contain the count of each integer found in the nums list, res will be the sum of the combinatorial sums based on the counts of integers in nums, and t is decremented by 1; n is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`num_of_lens`, `res`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
