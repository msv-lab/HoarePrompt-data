Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers converted from the input, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary.**

Explanation: The code `nums = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list called `nums`. The variable `num_of_lens` remains unchanged as it was an empty dictionary before the execution of the code.
