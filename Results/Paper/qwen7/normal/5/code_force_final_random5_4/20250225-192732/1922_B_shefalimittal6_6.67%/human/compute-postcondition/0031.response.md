Output State: **`res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, `total_sum` remains the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except the current `cnt`, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.**

This means that the value of `res` has been updated by adding `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` to its previous value. The `total_sum` and `cnt` retain their roles as described in the initial state, with `total_sum` being the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except the current `cnt`, and `cnt` being the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`. The variable `res` now includes the additional value calculated from the combination of `cnt` and `total_sum`.
