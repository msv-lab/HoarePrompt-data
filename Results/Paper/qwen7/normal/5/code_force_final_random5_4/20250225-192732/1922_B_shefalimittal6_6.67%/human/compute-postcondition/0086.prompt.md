Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The `num_of_lens` dictionary will contain counts of each integer found in the `nums` list, `res` is 0, and `x` is the last element of `nums`.
Code of the loop:
for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
    if cnt >= 3:
        res += math.comb(cnt, 3)
    if cnt >= 2:
        total_sum = sum(i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt)
        res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `num_of_lens` contains at least one key-value pair, `res` is increased by either `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` (if `cnt` >= 2) or `math.comb(cnt, 3)` (if `cnt` < 2), and `total_sum` remains the sum of values in `num_of_lens.values()` excluding those equal to `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `num_of_lens` contains at least one key-value pair, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `total_sum` is now the sum of values in `num_of_lens.values()` excluding those equal to `cnt`, and `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `num_of_lens` contains at least one key-value pair, `total_sum` is the sum of values in `num_of_lens.values()` excluding the current `cnt`, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
