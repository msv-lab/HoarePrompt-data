Postcondition: `nums` is a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` remains unchanged, and `res` is updated as follows: if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, then `res` is the original value of `res` plus the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt` multiplied by `math.comb(cnt, 2)`. If `cnt` is less than 2, then `res` remains unchanged.
