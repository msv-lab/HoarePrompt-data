Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `cnt`, which is taken from `num_of_lens.values()`. Therefore, the only variable that can be adjusted is `cnt`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are values in `num_of_lens.values()`.

3. **Determine the Change in `cnt`**: Since `cnt` is taken from `num_of_lens.values()`, each iteration of the loop will use a different value from `num_of_lens.values()`. After each iteration, `cnt` will be set to the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.

4. **Postcondition Analysis**: The postcondition states that `nums` remains a non-empty list of integers and `num_of_lens` remains unchanged. This means that the list `nums` and the dictionary `num_of_lens` do not change within the loop. The variable `res` is updated based on the value of `cnt`.

5. **Adjusting the State**: For the loop to execute one more time, `cnt` must be set to the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`. If `cnt` was previously set to a value, it will now be set to the next value in the sequence.

Given this analysis, the state needs to be adjusted such that `cnt` is set to the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`nums` remains a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` remains unchanged, and `cnt` is set to the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`**.
