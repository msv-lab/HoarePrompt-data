To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the operations performed:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `res` is initialized to 0.
   - `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are the counts of those integers.
   - For each unique integer `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` that appears 3 or more times, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`.
   - For each unique integer `cnt` that appears 2 or more times, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, where `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`.

2. **Operations**:
   - We need to iterate over the values in `num_of_lens` to find how many times each integer appears.
   - For each integer `cnt` that appears 3 or more times, add `math.comb(cnt, 3)` to `res`.
   - For each integer `cnt` that appears 2 or more times, add `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` to `res`.

3. **Calculation**:
   - Let's assume `num_of_lens` is given as an example: `{3: 4, 5: 2, 7: 6}`.
     - For `cnt = 3` (appears 4 times), `math.comb(3, 3) = 1`, so add 1 to `res`.
     - For `cnt = 5` (appears 2 times), `math.comb(5, 2) = 10`, and `total_sum = 4 + 2 + 6 = 12`, so add `10 * 12 = 120` to `res`.
     - For `cnt = 7` (appears 6 times), `math.comb(7, 3) = 35`, so add 35 to `res`.

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - `res = 1 + 120 + 35 = 156`.

Therefore, the final value of `res` is 156.

Output: **156**
