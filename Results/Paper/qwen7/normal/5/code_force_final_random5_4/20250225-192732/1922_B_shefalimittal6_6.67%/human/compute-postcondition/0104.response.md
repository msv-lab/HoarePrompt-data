Output State: **`res` is the original value of `res` plus the combination of `cnt` taken 3 at a time, `num_of_lens` remains unchanged, `nums` remains unchanged, and `cnt` remains greater than or equal to 3.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `res` by adding the value of the combination of `cnt` taken 3 at a time (denoted as `math.comb(cnt, 3)`). The other variables (`num_of_lens`, `nums`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
