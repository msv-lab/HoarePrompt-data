Output State: **`res` is updated to its original value plus math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum, `nums` remains a non-empty list of integers, `num_of_lens` remains unchanged, and `total_sum` remains the sum of values in `num_of_lens` where each value is not equal to `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `res` by adding the product of `math.comb(cnt, 2)` and `total_sum` to its current value. The other variables (`nums`, `num_of_lens`, and `total_sum`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
