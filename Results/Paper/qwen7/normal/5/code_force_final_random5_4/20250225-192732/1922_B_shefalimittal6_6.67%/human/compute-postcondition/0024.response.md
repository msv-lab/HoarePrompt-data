Postcondition: `cnt` is an integer, and if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is updated to `res + math.comb(cnt, 3) + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2 but less than 3, `res` remains unchanged. Here, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except `cnt`.
