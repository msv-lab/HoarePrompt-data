Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the specified operations. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sum Check**: For each test case, it calculates the total amount of water and checks if this total is divisible by `n`. If not, it immediately returns "NO" because it is impossible to make the amounts equal.
3. **Mean Calculation**: If the total is divisible by `n`, it calculates the mean amount of water per container.
4. **Balance Check**: It then iterates through the list of water amounts and keeps a running balance of the difference between the current amount and the mean. If at any point the balance becomes negative, it means the distribution cannot be made uniform, so it returns "NO".
5. **Final Check**: If the loop completes without finding a negative balance, it returns "YES", indicating that the distribution can be made uniform.

This approach ensures that the program correctly identifies whether it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water based on the given constraints and operations.
