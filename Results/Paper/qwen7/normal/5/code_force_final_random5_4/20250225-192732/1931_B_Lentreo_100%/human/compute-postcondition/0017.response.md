Postcondition: `total` is the sum of all elements in `nums`, `n` is the length of `nums`, `total % n == 0`, `mean` is `total // n`, `curr` is `nums[2] - mean`, `i` is `3`. If `curr` is less than 0, the function returns 'NO'. Otherwise, `curr` remains unchanged and the function does not return anything.
