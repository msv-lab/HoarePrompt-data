Output State: **The program returns 'YES'**

In the given initial state, we know that:
- `total` is the sum of all elements in `nums`.
- `n` is the length of `nums`.
- `total % n == 0`, meaning `total` is divisible by `n`.
- `mean` is `total // n`.
- `curr` is the sum of all elements in `nums` minus `n * mean`.
- `i` is `n`.

The code snippet provided does not modify any of these variables; instead, it checks if `curr < 0` and returns `'NO'` if true. However, since `curr` is defined as `total - n * mean`, and given that `total % n == 0`, it implies `total = n * mean`. Therefore, `curr` will be `n * mean - n * mean = 0`. Since `curr` is not less than 0, the function will return `'YES'` without any further action.
