### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Initial Setup**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers (`n`) and the list of water amounts (`nums`).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes the list `nums` as input.
   - It calculates the total amount of water (`total`) and checks if `total % n == 0`. If not, it immediately returns 'NO', indicating that it's impossible to make all containers have the same amount of water.
   - If the condition `total % n == 0` is satisfied, it proceeds to calculate the mean amount of water per container (`mean`), which is `total // n`.
   - It then iterates through the list `nums` and calculates the cumulative difference between each element and the mean (`curr`). If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means that it's impossible to redistribute the water to make all containers have the same amount, and the function returns 'NO'.
   - If the loop completes without finding a negative `curr`, it concludes that it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water and returns 'YES'.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The constraints ensure that the sum of the water amounts in each test case is divisible by `n`, so the initial check `total % n == 0` is always valid.
   - The function handles the case where redistributing water might lead to a negative cumulative difference, which would indicate an impossible redistribution.

Given the logic and the constraints, the function `func_1` correctly determines whether it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the provided logic and constraints.

**Correctness: True**
