Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i < n`.
   - The variable `i` will take on values from `0` to `n-1` during the iterations.
   - The variable `n` represents the length of the list `nums`.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` starts at `0` and increments by `1` each time through the loop, we need to ensure that `i` is `0` at the start of the loop.
   - The value of `n` should be the length of `nums`, but this is already given as part of the initial state.

4. **Final State Adjustment**:
   - The state before the loop starts is given as follows:
     - `n` is the length of `nums`.
     - `total` is the sum of all elements in `nums`.
     - `total % n == 0`.
     - `mean` is `total // n`.
     - `curr` is `0`.
   - To ensure the loop can execute, we need to set `i` to `0`.

Therefore, the adjusted state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`total` is the sum of all elements in `nums`, `n` is the length of `nums`, `total % n == 0`, `mean` is `total // n`, `curr` is `0`, `i` is `0**.
