### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another. The key insight is that if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers, then it is always possible to distribute the water evenly among all containers.

2. **Key Points in the Code**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list `nums` representing the amounts of water in each container.
   - It first checks if the total amount of water (`total`) is divisible by the number of containers (`n`). If not, it immediately returns 'NO'.
   - If the total is divisible by `n`, it calculates the mean amount of water per container (`mean`).
   - It then iterates through the list of water amounts, keeping a running difference (`curr`) between the current total and the target total (`n * mean`).
   - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means we have more water in some containers than required, making it impossible to distribute evenly, so it returns 'NO'.
   - If the loop completes without finding such a situation, it returns 'YES', indicating that the water can be distributed evenly.

3. **Annotations and Correctness**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
   - The logic in the code matches the reasoning provided in the original assessment.
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where the total amount of water is not divisible by the number of containers.
   - The loop correctly maintains the running difference and ensures that the water can be distributed evenly if the condition is met.

4. **Test Cases**:
   - The example test cases provided in the problem statement are correctly handled by the code.
   - The code passes all the given test cases, indicating that it works as expected.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem.
