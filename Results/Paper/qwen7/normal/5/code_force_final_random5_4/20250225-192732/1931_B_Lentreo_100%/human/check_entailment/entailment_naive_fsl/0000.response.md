Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sum Check**: It calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by `n`. If not, it immediately returns 'NO'.
3. **Mean Calculation**: It computes the mean amount of water per container.
4. **Balance Check**: It iterates through the list of water amounts and ensures that the cumulative difference between the current sum and the mean remains non-negative. If at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, it returns 'NO'. Otherwise, it returns 'YES'.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program handles all potential cases correctly as per the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
