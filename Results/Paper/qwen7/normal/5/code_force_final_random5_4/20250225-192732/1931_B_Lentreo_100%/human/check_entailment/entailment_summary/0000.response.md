Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the specified operations. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sum Check**: For each test case, it calculates the sum of the water amounts in the containers (`total`). It then checks if this sum is divisible by the number of containers (`n`). If not, it immediately returns 'NO', indicating that it's impossible to make the amounts equal because the total cannot be evenly distributed.
3. **Mean Calculation**: If the sum is divisible by `n`, it calculates the mean amount of water per container (`mean`).
4. **Balance Check**: It then iterates through the list of water amounts and checks if the cumulative difference between the current sum and the mean is ever negative. If it is, it means there's no way to redistribute the water to make all containers have the same amount, so it returns 'NO'. Otherwise, it returns 'YES'.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly determines whether it's possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

Correctness: **True**
