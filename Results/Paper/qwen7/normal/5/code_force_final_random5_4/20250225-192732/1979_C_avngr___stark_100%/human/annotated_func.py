#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 2 <= a, b <= 20.
def func_1(a, b):
    return abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)
    #The program returns the absolute value of the product of a and b divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd), where a and b are integers between 2 and 20 inclusive.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters \(a\) and \(b\), both within the range of 2 to 20 inclusive. It calculates the absolute value of the product of \(a\) and \(b\) divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd) and returns this value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers where each integer k_i satisfies 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20 and the length of the list n satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
def func_2(numbers):
    result = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        result = func_1(result, num)
        
    #State: Output State: The final value of `result` will be the return value of `func_1` when it is called with the last two elements of the `numbers` list as arguments.
    #
    #In more detail, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `result` will hold the cumulative result of applying the function `func_1` successively to pairs of consecutive elements from the `numbers` list, starting with the first element. Specifically, if the `numbers` list has \( n \) elements, then `result` will be equivalent to:
    #
    #\[ \text{result} = \text{func\_1}(\ldots(\text{func\_1}(\text{func\_1}(\text{result}, \text{numbers}[1]), \text{numbers}[2]), \ldots, \text{numbers}[n-1]), \text{numbers}[n]) \]
    #
    #This means `result` will be the outcome of applying `func_1` to the first element of `numbers` and then successively to each subsequent element in the list.
    return result
    #The program returns the cumulative result of applying the function `func_1` successively to pairs of consecutive elements from the `numbers` list, starting with the first element.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `numbers`. It applies the function `func_1` successively to pairs of consecutive elements from the `numbers` list, starting with the first element, and returns the cumulative result.
