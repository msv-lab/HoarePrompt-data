Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for num in numbers[1:]`.
   - This means the loop iterates over the elements starting from the second element of the `numbers` list.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `numbers` must have at least two elements.
   - `num` is the second element of `numbers`.
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(result, num)`.

3. **Determine the next state**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in `numbers[1:]` must be considered.
   - Since `num` was the second element, the next element would be the third element of `numbers`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `numbers` still must have at least two elements (this condition remains unchanged).
   - `num` should now be the third element of `numbers`.
   - `result` will be updated to the return value of `func_1(result, num)` where `num` is now the third element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`numbers` must have at least two elements, `num` is the third element of `numbers`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(result, num)`**
