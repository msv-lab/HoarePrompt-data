Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` and the condition `range(int(input()))`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the value of `int(input())`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `t` is the total number of iterations until `x` becomes 1
   - `x` is 1
   - `max` is 100000000 - `t`
   - `min` is -100000000 + `t`
   - `ans` is a list containing integers starting from 100000000 down to `100000000 - t`, and it is reversed.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - The value of `int(input())` is not specified, but it determines how many times the loop will run. Since `i` is currently 0, the input value must be at least 1 for the loop to execute again.
   - The values of `t`, `x`, `max`, `min`, and `ans` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, which is not provided here.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `t`, `x`, `max`, `min`, and `ans` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 1, `t` is the total number of iterations until `x` becomes 1, `x` is 1, `max` is 100000000 - `t`, `min` is -100000000 + `t`, `ans` is a list containing integers starting from 100000000 down to `100000000 - t`, and it is reversed.**
