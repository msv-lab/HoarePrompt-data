Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is 2, `x` is 0, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is either -100000000 or -99999999, `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000 and 99999998 or 99999999**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `max` to the list `ans`. Since `max` can be either 99999998 or 99999999, the list `ans` will now contain one more element, which is `max`. The other variables remain unchanged.
