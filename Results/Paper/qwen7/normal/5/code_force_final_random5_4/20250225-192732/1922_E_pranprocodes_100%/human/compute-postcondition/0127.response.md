Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 2.
- `t` is 100000000.
- `x` is 1.
- `max` is -100000000.
- `min` is 100000000.
- `ans` is a list containing -100000000 repeated 50000000 times and 100000000 repeated 50000000 times.

The `print(t)` statement will simply print the value of the variable `t`.

Output: **100000000**
