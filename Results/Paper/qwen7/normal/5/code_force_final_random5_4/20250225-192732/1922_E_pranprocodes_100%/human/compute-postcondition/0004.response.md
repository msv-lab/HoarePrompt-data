Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an input integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `ans`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `t`, `x`, `max`, `min`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
