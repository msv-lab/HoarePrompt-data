Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it calculates the number of steps (`t`) required to reduce an integer `x` (with constraints 2 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18) to 1 by either dividing it by 2 if even or decrementing it by 1 if odd. It also constructs a list `ans` containing alternating values of a maximum (`max`) and minimum (`min`) integer initialized to 100000000 and -100000000 respectively, and prints both `t` and `ans`. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the total number of steps and the constructed list for each case.**
