Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is 2, `x` is either 0 or 0.5, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is either -99999998 or -99999999, `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000 with -100000000 appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `min += 1` increments the value of `min` by 1. Since `min` can be either -100000000 or -99999999, after executing the code, `min` will be either -99999998 or -99999999. All other variables remain unchanged.
