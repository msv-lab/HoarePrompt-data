Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is 1, `x` must not be equal to 1, `max` is either 99999999 or 100000000, `min` is -99999998, `ans` is a list containing -100000000 and -99999998.**

Explanation: The value of `min` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `min` was either -100000000 or -99999999, after adding 1, `min` becomes -99999999 or -99999998. The other variables remain unchanged.
