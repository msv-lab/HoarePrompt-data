Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is 0, `x` must not be equal to 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing the value 100000000, and the current value of `x` is even.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `max` (which is 100000000) to the list `ans`. Since `ans` was initially an empty list, after appending `max`, `ans` becomes a list containing the single element 100000000. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
