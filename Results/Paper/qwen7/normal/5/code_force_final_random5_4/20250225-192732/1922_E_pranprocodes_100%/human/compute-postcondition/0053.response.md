Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is 0, `x` is not equal to 1, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing the value 100000000, `x` is updated to its value divided by 2.**

The value of `x` is updated to its current value divided by 2, while all other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `x` is now half of its original value, but since the exact original value was not specified, we only know that `x` is not equal to 1 anymore (assuming it was originally equal to 1).
