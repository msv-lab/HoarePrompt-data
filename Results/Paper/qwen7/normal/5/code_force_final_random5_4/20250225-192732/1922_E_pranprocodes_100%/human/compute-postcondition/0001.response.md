Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The variable `i` remains unchanged with a value of 0. The variable `t` is not directly affected by the code, but its condition (being a positive integer between 1 and 1000) remains valid. The variable `x` is assigned the value of the integer input provided by the user.
