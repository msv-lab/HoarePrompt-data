Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is 0, `x` is not equal to 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing `-100000000`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `min` to the list `ans`. Since `min` is initially -100000000, `ans` becomes a list containing this value. The other variables remain unchanged.
