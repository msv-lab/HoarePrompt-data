You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, X is an integer such that 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^{18}.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        max = 100000000
        
        min = -100000000
        
        ans = []
        
        t = 0
        
        while x != 1:
            if x % 2 == 0:
                ans.append(max)
                max -= 1
                x = x // 2
            else:
                ans.append(min)
                min += 1
                x -= 1
            t += 1
        
        ans.reverse()
        
        print(t)
        
        print(*ans)
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is 999999, `t` is 100000000, `x` is 1, `max` is -100000000, `min` is 100000000, `ans` is a list containing -100000000 repeated 50000000 times and 100000000 repeated 50000000 times.
    #
    #Explanation: Given the constraints, the maximum value of `x` can be \(10^{18}\). In the worst-case scenario, which is when `x` is always odd, the loop will run until `x` reaches 1. This requires \(100000000\) iterations because the loop increments `min` and decrements `x` by 1 in each iteration, effectively halving the range of values between `max` and `min` each time. Since `t` is incremented in each iteration, it will reach `100000000` after `999999` inputs (as the loop starts from `i=0`). At the end of the loop, `x` will be 1, `max` will be -100000000, `min` will be 100000000, and `ans` will contain `-100000000` repeated 50000000 times followed by 100000000 repeated 50000000 times, as the list `ans` is reversed at the end.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns a string indicating whether the given test case value of X is within the range 2 to 10^18 and t is within the range 1 to 1000.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
