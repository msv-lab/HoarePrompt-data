Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i < int(input())`. This means that the value of `int(input())` determines how many times the loop will run.

3. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The variable `i` starts at 0 because `range(int(input()))` generates numbers from 0 up to but not including `int(input())`.

4. **Adjust the state of `t`**: Since `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), it must be set to a valid value within this range to ensure the loop can execute. The exact value of `t` does not directly affect the loop's execution, but it must be valid.

5. **Adjust the state of `X`**: The variable `X` is mentioned in the problem statement but is not part of the loop head. Therefore, its state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the only states that need to be adjusted are those related to the loop head, specifically `i` and `int(input())`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 0, `t` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000**
