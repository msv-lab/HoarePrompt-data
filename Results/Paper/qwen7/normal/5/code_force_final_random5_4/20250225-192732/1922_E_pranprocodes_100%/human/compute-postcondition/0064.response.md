Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is 1, `x` is 0.5, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is either -100000000 or -99999999, `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000 with 100000000 appended to it.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated to `x // 2`, which means `x` is now `1 // 2`, resulting in `x` being `0.5`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
