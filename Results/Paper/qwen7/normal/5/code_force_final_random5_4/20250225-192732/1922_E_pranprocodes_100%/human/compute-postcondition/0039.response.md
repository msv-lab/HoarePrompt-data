Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is the total number of iterations until `x` becomes 1, `x` is 1, `max` is 100000000 - `t`, `min` is -100000000 + `t`, `ans` is a list containing integers starting from 100000000 down to `100000000 - t`, `ans` is reversed.**

Explanation: The `ans.reverse()` method reverses the list `ans`. Since `ans` was initially a list of integers starting from 100000000 down to `100000000 - t`, reversing it will make it start from `100000000 - t` and end at 100000000. All other variables (`i`, `t`, `x`, `max`, `min`) remain unchanged.
