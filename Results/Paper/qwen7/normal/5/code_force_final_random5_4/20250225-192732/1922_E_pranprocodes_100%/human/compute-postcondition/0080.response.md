Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is 3, `x` is either 0 or -0.5, `max` is either 99999997 or 99999998, `min` is either -100000000 or -99999999, `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000 with either 99999998 or -100000000 appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `t += 1` increments the value of `t` by 1. Initially, `t` is 2, so after executing the code, `t` becomes 3. The values of the other variables (`i`, `x`, `max`, `min`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
