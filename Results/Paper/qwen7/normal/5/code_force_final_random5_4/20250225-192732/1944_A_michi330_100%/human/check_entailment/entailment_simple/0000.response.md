Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n` and `k` for each case.
3. The logic inside the loop checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`. If true, it prints `1`, meaning Everule can only visit island 1. Otherwise, it prints `n`, meaning all islands are reachable.
4. The conditions and logic align with the problem statement:
   - If `k` is large enough to destroy all but one bridge, Everule can only visit island 1.
   - If `k` is insufficient to disconnect all but one island, Everule can visit all islands.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the function, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of islands Everule can visit based on the optimal destruction of bridges by Dominater.

Correctness: **True**
