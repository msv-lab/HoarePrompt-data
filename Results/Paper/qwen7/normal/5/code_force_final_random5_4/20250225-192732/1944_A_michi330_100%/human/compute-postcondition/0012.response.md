Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `i` is `t`, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split**.

Explanation: The code splits the input into two integers and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and `i` retains its initial value of `t`. The output state includes the updated values of `n` and `k` as they are obtained from the input, while `t` and `i` retain their initial values.
