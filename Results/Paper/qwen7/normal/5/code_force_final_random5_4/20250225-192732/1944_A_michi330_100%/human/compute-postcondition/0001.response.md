Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(0, t, 1)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `i` starts from 0 (as specified in the range function).

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1 because the range function `range(0, t, 1)` will generate values starting from 0 up to but not including `t`.
   - The value of `i` is irrelevant for determining if the loop can execute; it just starts from 0.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^3\), we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1.
   - The value of `i` being 0 is already implied by the range function and does not need adjustment.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be at least 1**
