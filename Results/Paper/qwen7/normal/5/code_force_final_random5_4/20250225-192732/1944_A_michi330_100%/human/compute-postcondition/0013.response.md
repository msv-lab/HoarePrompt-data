Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be at least 1.
- `i` is equal to `t`.
- `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split.
- `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split.

The `print(1)` statement will simply print the integer 1, regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k`.

Output: **1**
