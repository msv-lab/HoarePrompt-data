Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers \( t \), \( n \), and \( k \). For each test case, it reads \( t \) and then iterates \( t \) times, reading \( n \) and \( k \) in each iteration. Based on the value of \( k \) relative to \( n-1 \), it prints either 1 or \( n \). After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.**
