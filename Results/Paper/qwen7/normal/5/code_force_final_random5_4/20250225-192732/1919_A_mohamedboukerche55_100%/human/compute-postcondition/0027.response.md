Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` remains the same or is greater than 1, `i` is now `t-1`, `a` and `b` are the first and second integers from the last input string `s`, the sum of `a` and `b` remains even if `(a + b) % 2 == 0` is true. Otherwise, the sum of `a` and `b` is odd, `s` is the input string from the user, and no further changes occur to `a` and `b` during the loop.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `t` will either stay the same or decrease to 0 if it was initially 1. The variable `i` will be equal to `t-1` because the loop increments `i` in each iteration. The values of `a` and `b` will be the integers from the last input string `s` provided by the user, and their sum's parity (even or odd) will determine whether "Bob" or "Alice" is printed for that iteration.
