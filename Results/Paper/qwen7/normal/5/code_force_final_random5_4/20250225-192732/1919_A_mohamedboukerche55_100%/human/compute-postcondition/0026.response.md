Postcondition: **`t` remains the same or is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` is the first integer in the input string `s`, `b` is the second integer in the input string `s`, the sum of `a` and `b` remains even if `(a + b) % 2 == 0` is true. Otherwise, the sum of `a` and `b` is odd, `s` is the input string from the user, `b` is now the second integer from the string `s`.**
