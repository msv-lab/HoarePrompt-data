Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner based on the optimal strategy for the game. The logic in the provided code simply checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd and prints the corresponding player as the winner. This is incorrect because the game involves strategic exchanges and the parity of the sum of `a` and `b` does not directly determine the winner.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the following:

1. **Game Analysis**: 
   - If `a` and `b` are both odd, then after the first move, one of them becomes even and the other remains odd. The player whose turn it is will always be able to force the other player into a losing position by ensuring that the sum of `a` and `b` is even at the end of their turn.
   - If `a` and `b` are both even, then after the first move, one of them becomes odd and the other remains even. The player whose turn it is will always be able to force the other player into a losing position by ensuring that the sum of `a` and `b` is odd at the end of their turn.
   - If one of `a` or `b` is odd and the other is even, then the player whose turn it is can always ensure that the sum remains odd/even at the end of their turn, forcing the other player into a losing position.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - If `a` and `b` are both odd or both even, the player who starts (Alice) can always force the other player into a losing position.
   - If one of `a` or `b` is odd and the other is even, the player who starts (Alice) can also force the other player into a losing position.

Therefore, the correct logic should check if both `a` and `b` are odd or both are even, and print "Alice" in those cases, otherwise print "Bob".

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if (a % 2 == b % 2):  # Both are odd or both are even
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')

func()
```

This code correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the optimal strategy for the game.
