Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head includes the variable `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < t`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `a` is the first integer from the input string `s`.
   - `b` is the second integer from the input string `s`.
   - `i` is 0.
   - The sum of `a` and `b` is even if \((a + b) \% 2 == 0\) is true. Otherwise, the sum of `a` and `b` is odd.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `t`. Therefore, `t` must remain the same or be greater than 1 (since `i` is now 1).

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `t`.

**State:**
- `t` remains the same or is greater than 1.
- `i` is now 1.
- `a` and `b` remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.
- The sum of `a` and `b` remains even if \((a + b) \% 2 == 0\) is true. Otherwise, the sum of `a` and `b` is odd.

So, the final state is:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `a` is the first integer from the input string `s`, `b` is the second integer from the input string `s`, `i` is 1, and the sum of `a` and `b` is even if \((a + b) \% 2 == 0\) is true. Otherwise, the sum of `a` and `b` is odd.**
