Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers where their values are input from the user and satisfy `a < b < c` or they are not all equal and the maximum value among them is either `b` or not equal to `b`. If `max(a, b, c) == b`, no changes are made to `a`, `b`, and `c`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `a`, `b`, and `c`.**
