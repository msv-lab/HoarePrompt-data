Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
- `i` is 1.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers with specific conditions regarding their relative values and equality.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print('NONE')
```

This code simply prints the string `'NONE'` regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Output: **NONE**
