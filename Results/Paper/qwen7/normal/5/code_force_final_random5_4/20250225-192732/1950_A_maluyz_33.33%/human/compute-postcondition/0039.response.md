Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
- `i` is 2.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers where their values are input from the user and satisfy `a < b < c` or they are not all equal and the maximum value among them is either `b` or not equal to `b`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'PEAK'`.

Output: **'PEAK'**
