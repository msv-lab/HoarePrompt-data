Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers where their values are input from the user and satisfy `a < b < c` or they are not all equal and the maximum value among them is either `b` or not equal to `b`.**

The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively. The initial values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged, and the conditions on `a`, `b`, and `c` are preserved as per the input constraints.
