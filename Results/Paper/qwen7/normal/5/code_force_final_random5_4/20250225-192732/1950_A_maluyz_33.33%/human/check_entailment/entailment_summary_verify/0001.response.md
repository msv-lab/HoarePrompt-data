### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Digits**: For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.
3. **Stair Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIR' if this condition is met. This part of the logic is correct.
4. **Peak Condition Check**: The program checks if `max(a, b, c) == b` and prints 'PEAK' if this condition is met. However, this logic is flawed because it does not correctly handle all peak conditions. Specifically, a peak should satisfy `a < b > c`, meaning `b` must be greater than both `a` and `c`. The current logic incorrectly flags any case where `b` is the maximum as a peak, even if `a` is not less than `b` or `c` is not less than `b`.
5. **Equal Digits Condition**: If both the stair and peak conditions are not met, it checks if all digits are equal (`a == b == c`) and prints 'NONE'. This part of the logic is correct.
6. **Default Case**: If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'NONE'. This part of the logic is also correct.

### Analysis of Peak Condition:
- The condition `max(a, b, c) == b` is incorrect for determining a peak. A peak should satisfy `a < b > c`, which means `b` must be greater than both `a` and `c`.
- The current logic incorrectly flags any case where `b` is the maximum as a peak, even if `a` is not less than `b` or `c` is not less than `b`.

### Example Test Cases:
- For the input `3 4 1`, the program incorrectly prints 'PEAK' because `max(3, 4, 1) == 4`, but it should print 'PEAK' only if `3 < 4 > 1`.
- For the input `4 1 7`, the program incorrectly prints 'NONE' because `max(4, 1, 7) == 7`, but it should print 'STAIR' because `4 < 7 > 1`.

### Corrected Logic for Peak Condition:
To correctly identify a peak, we need to check if `a < b > c`:
```python
if a < b > c:
    print('PEAK')
```

### Updated Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was accurate. The program is incorrect due to the flawed logic for identifying peaks. The corrected logic should check `a < b > c` to properly identify a peak.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
