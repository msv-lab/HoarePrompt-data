Reasoning:
1. The function correctly initializes `t` with the number of test cases.
2. It iterates through each test case using a loop.
3. For each test case, it reads three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).
4. The conditions to check if the numbers form a 'STAIR' or a 'PEAK' are correctly implemented:
   - A 'STAIR' is determined by the condition `a < b < c`.
   - A 'PEAK' is determined by the condition `max(a, b, c) == b`, which means \(b\) is the middle value and the largest.
5. The code handles the case where all three digits are equal (`a == b == c`) by printing 'NONE'.
6. Any other combination of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) results in 'NONE'.

Given the problem description and the example provided, the function correctly implements the logic to determine if the digits form a 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE'. There are no logical errors or missing conditions in the provided code.

Correctness: **True**
