You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a series of test cases, each containing three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). For each set of integers, it determines whether the sequence forms a 'STAIR' (if \(a < b < c\)), a 'PEAK' (if the maximum value among \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is \(b\)), or 'NONE' otherwise. It prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Digits**: For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.
3. **Stair Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIR' if this condition is met.
4. **Peak Condition Check**: It then checks if `max(a, b, c) == b` and prints 'PEAK' if this condition is met. This logic is flawed because it does not correctly handle all peak conditions.
5. **Equal Digits Condition**: If both the stair and peak conditions are not met, it checks if all digits are equal (`a == b == c`) and prints 'NONE'.
6. **Default Case**: If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'NONE'.

### Analysis of Peak Condition:
- The condition `max(a, b, c) == b` is incorrect for determining a peak. A peak should satisfy `a < b > c`, which means `b` must be greater than both `a` and `c`.
- The current logic incorrectly flags any case where `b` is the maximum as a peak, even if `a` is not less than `b` or `c` is not less than `b`.

### Example Test Cases:
- For the input `3 4 1`, the program incorrectly prints 'PEAK' because `max(3, 4, 1) == 4`, but it should print 'PEAK' only if `3 < 4 > 1`.
- For the input `4 1 7`, the program incorrectly prints 'NONE' because `max(4, 1, 7) == 7`, but it should print 'STAIR' because `4 < 7 > 1`.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to the flawed logic for identifying peaks.

### Correctness:
**False**
