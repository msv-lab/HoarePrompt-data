Output State: **`node_u` is `u`, `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight of the tree rooted at `parent_u`, `w` is the weight from the next tuple in `edges`, `u` is the first element of the next tuple in `edges`, `v` is the second element of the next tuple in `edges`, `parent_u` is the root of `u` in the DSU structure, `parent_v` is the root of `v` in the DSU structure, the DSU union operation unites `u` and `v` with weight `w`.**

Explanation: The line `node_u = u` simply assigns the value of `u` to `node_u`. No other variables are affected. The values of `_min_edge`, `w`, `u`, `v`, `parent_u`, `parent_v`, and the DSU union operation remain unchanged from their initial states.
