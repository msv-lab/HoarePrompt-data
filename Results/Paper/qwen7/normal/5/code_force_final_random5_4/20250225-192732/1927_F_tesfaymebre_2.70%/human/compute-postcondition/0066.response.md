Functionality: **The function processes a graph represented by vertices and weighted edges using a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure to find the minimum edge weight among all connected components. It then performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from a specified node to determine the size of the connected component containing that node. Finally, it prints the minimum edge weight found and the sequence of nodes visited during the DFS traversal.**
