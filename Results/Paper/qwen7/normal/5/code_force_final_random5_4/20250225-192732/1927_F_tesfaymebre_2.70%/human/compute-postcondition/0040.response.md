Output State: **`w` is the weight from the next tuple in `edges`, `u` is the first element of the next tuple in `edges`, `v` is the second element of the next tuple in `edges`, `_min_edge` is updated based on the conditions described, `parent_u` is the root of `u` in the disjoint set union (DSU) structure, `parent_v` is the root of `v` in the DSU structure.**

Explanation: The line `parent_v = dsu.find(v)` finds the root of node `v` in the disjoint set union (DSU) structure and assigns it to `parent_v`. The values of `w`, `u`, `v`, `_min_edge`, and `parent_u` remain unchanged.
