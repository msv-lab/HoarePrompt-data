Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `(w, u, v)` from the tuple `edges`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - `w` is the weight from the next tuple in `edges`.
   - `u` is the first element of the next tuple in `edges`.
   - `v` is the second element of the next tuple in `edges`.
   - `_min_edge` remains unchanged.
   - `parent_u` is the root of `u` in the DSU structure.
   - `parent_v` is the root of `v` in the DSU structure.
   - If `parent_u` equals `parent_v`, the values of `parent_u` and `parent_v` remain unchanged.
   - Otherwise, the union operation between `u` and `v` has been performed with weight `w`, and `parent_u` and `parent_v` are updated accordingly.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over the tuples in `edges`, the next tuple in `edges` will provide the new values for `w`, `u`, and `v`.
   - `_min_edge` remains unchanged.
   - `parent_u` and `parent_v` will be updated if they were different in the previous iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `w` is the weight from the next tuple in `edges`.
- `u` is the first element of the next tuple in `edges`.
- `v` is the second element of the next tuple in `edges`.
- `_min_edge` remains unchanged.
- `parent_u` is the root of `u` in the DSU structure.
- `parent_v` is the root of `v` in the DSU structure.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `w`, `u`, and `v` to reflect the next tuple in `edges`. The other states (`_min_edge`, `parent_u`, `parent_v`) remain unchanged unless the union operation is performed, but since we are only considering the loop head, these states do not change.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`w` is the weight from the next tuple in `edges`, `u` is the first element of the next tuple in `edges`, `v` is the second element of the next tuple in `edges`, `_min_edge` remains unchanged, `parent_u` is the root of `u` in the DSU structure, `parent_v` is the root of `v` in the DSU structure**.
