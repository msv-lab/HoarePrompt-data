Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding a simple cycle with the minimal weight of the lightest edge in an undirected weighted graph.
2. The provided code consists of several functions that process the graph and find the required cycle.
3. `func_1()`, `func_2()`, `func_3()`, `func_4()`, and `func_5()` are utility functions for reading input from standard input.
4. `func_6()` constructs the graph and uses a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) to find the minimum edge weight in a cycle. It sorts the edges in descending order of their weights and iteratively unions nodes while keeping track of the minimum edge weight in each connected component.
5. `dfs()` is a depth-first search function used to find the cycle containing the node with the minimum edge weight.
6. `func_7()` processes multiple test cases by calling `func_6()` for each test case.

Let's analyze the correctness of the solution:
- The graph construction and edge sorting are correctly implemented.
- The DSU operations are used to keep track of the minimum edge weight in each connected component.
- The DFS function correctly identifies cycles and ensures that the cycle includes the node with the minimum edge weight.
- The output format matches the problem requirements.

Based on the analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
