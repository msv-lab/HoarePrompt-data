Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The function `func_6()` is called, but since no changes are made to any variables within the function call itself (assuming `func_6()` does not modify `test_cases`), the precondition that `test_cases` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. No other variables are affected, so their states remain as they were in the initial state.
