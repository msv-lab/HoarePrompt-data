Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `w`, `u`, `v`, and the tuple `(w, u, v)` itself. However, since the loop body is omitted, we need to focus on how these variables change within the loop.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each tuple `(w, u, v)` in the `edges` list. Each iteration processes a new tuple.

3. **Determine the Changes in Variables**:
   - `w` is the weight from the current tuple `(w, u, v)`.
   - `u` is the first element of the current tuple `(w, u, v)`.
   - `v` is the second element of the current tuple `(w, u, v)`.
   - The variables `parent_u` and `parent_v` are determined by the DSU (Disjoint Set Union) structure and do not change within the loop.
   - `_min_edge` is updated based on the conditions given in the problem statement.

4. **Update `_min_edge`**:
   - If `parent_u` equals `parent_v`, `_min_edge` is set to `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` if the minimum edge weight for `parent_u` is less than `_min_edge`; otherwise, `_min_edge` remains unchanged.
   - If `parent_u` does not equal `parent_v`, `_min_edge` remains unchanged and `parent_u` is now equal to `parent_v` after the union operation.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, the tuple `(w, u, v)` will be the next tuple in the `edges` list.
   - `w` will be the weight from this new tuple.
   - `u` will be the first element of this new tuple.
   - `v` will be the second element of this new tuple.
   - `parent_u` and `parent_v` will be determined by the DSU structure for the new `u` and `v`.

Given the above, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are `w`, `u`, `v`, and `_min_edge`.

**State at the start of the next iteration:**
- `w` is the weight from the next tuple in `edges`.
- `u` is the first element of the next tuple in `edges`.
- `v` is the second element of the next tuple in `edges`.
- `_min_edge` is updated based on the conditions described.

Therefore, the state should be:
**State: **`w` is the weight from the next tuple in `edges`, `u` is the first element of the next tuple in `edges`, `v` is the second element of the next tuple in `edges`, `_min_edge` is updated based on the conditions described.**
