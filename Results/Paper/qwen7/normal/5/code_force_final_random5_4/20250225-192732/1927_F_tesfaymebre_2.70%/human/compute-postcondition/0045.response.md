Postcondition: **`w` is the weight from the next tuple in `edges`, `u` is the first element of the next tuple in `edges`, `v` is the second element of the next tuple in `edges`, `_min_edge` remains unchanged, `parent_u` is updated to be the root of `u` in the DSU structure, `parent_v` is updated to be the root of `v` in the DSU structure. If `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` is less than `_min_edge`, then `node_u` is `u` and `node_v` is `v`; otherwise, the values of `node_u` and `node_v` remain unchanged.**
