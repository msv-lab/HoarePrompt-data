Postcondition: `colors[curr]` is set to 1, `curr` is an integer representing the current vertex being visited, `parent` is an integer representing the previously visited vertex, `path` is a list representing the current path of vertices being explored with `curr` appended to it, `res` is updated to the return value from the dfs function call, `set_res` is a set containing the elements of `res`. If `res` is not empty and `node_v` is in `set_res`, the function returns `res`. Otherwise, the function continues the exploration as per the original conditions.
