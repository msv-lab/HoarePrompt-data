Output State: **`colors[curr]` is set to 1, `curr` is an integer representing the current vertex being visited, `parent` is an integer representing the previously visited vertex, `path` is a list representing the current path of vertices being explored with `curr` appended to it, `nei` is the next neighbor of `curr` in the graph that satisfies the conditions (not colored 2, not equal to `parent`, and either `res` is empty or `nei` is not in `set_res`), `colors[nei]` is not 2, `nei` is not equal to `parent`, `res` is updated to the return value from the dfs function call, where `set_res` is a set containing the elements of `res`.**

In this output state, the `res` variable has been updated to the return value from the `dfs` function call, which means `res` now contains the result of the depth-first search starting from the neighbor `nei`. All other variables retain their previous values and conditions as described in the initial state.
