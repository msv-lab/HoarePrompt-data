Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but uses a pre-initialized Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure with n + 1 elements, a tuple (n, m) where 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(⌊n(n - 1)/2⌋, 2 ⋅ 10^5), and a list of tuples `edges` where each tuple contains three integers (u, v, w) representing an edge between vertices u and v with weight w. The function processes these inputs to determine if a minimum spanning tree exists within the given constraints and returns either True or False based on the result.**
