Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `curr` (an integer representing the current vertex), `parent` (an integer representing the previously visited vertex), and `path` (a list representing the current path of vertices being explored). It returns either the list `path`, a non-empty list `res` containing elements found during the DFS traversal, the result of the dfs function call for a neighbor `nei` of the current vertex `curr`, a set containing the elements of the original `res` list, or an empty list.**
