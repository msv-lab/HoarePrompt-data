Output State: **`colors[curr]` is set to 2, `curr` is an integer representing the current vertex being visited, `parent` is an integer representing the previously visited vertex, `path` is a list representing the final path of vertices being explored, `res` is a set containing the elements of the original `res` list, and `set_res` is the set created from `res`.**

Explanation: The line `colors[curr] = 2` changes the value of `colors[curr]` from 1 to 2. All other variables (`curr`, `parent`, `path`, `res`, and `set_res`) remain unchanged from their initial state. Since the loop has completed without returning, the function will eventually return `None`.
