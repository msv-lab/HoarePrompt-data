Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ test_cases ≤ 10^4. For each test case, it processes two integers `n` and `m` (3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(⌊n⋅(n - 1)/2⌋, 2⋅10^5)), followed by `m` lines of three integers `u`, `v`, and `w` (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v, 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6), representing the vertices and the weight of the edge between them. The function does not return a specific value but processes the input according to the described structure.**
