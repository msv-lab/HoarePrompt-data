Output State: **`e` must contain at least one character, P is 1, M is 0, i is len(e) + 1, q is the last character of e, s is an input integer, the current value of q is '+'.**

Explanation: The code `P += 1` increments the value of `P` by 1. Since `P` was initially 0, it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
