Output State: **`e` must contain at least one character, P is 0, M is 1, i is len(e) + 1, q is the last character of e, s is an input integer, and the last character of `e` is not '+'**.

The code `M += 1` increments the value of `M` by 1. Initially, `M` is 0, so after executing this line, `M` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
