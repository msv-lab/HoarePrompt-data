Output State: **`e` is a non-empty string, `q` is the second character of `e`, `M` is 2**.

Explanation: The initial state defines that `e` is a non-empty string, and `q` is the second character of `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 1, otherwise `q` is not '+' and `M` is 1. The code `M += 1` increments the value of `M` by 1. Since `M` was initially 1 (from the condition where `q` is not '+'), it is now 2. The value of `e` and `q` remain unchanged as the code does not affect them.
