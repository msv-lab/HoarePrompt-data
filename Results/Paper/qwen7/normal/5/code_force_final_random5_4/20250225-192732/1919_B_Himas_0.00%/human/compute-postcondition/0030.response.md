Output State: **`s` is an input integer, `e` is an input string, `P` is 0, `M` is 0, and `i` is `previous_i + 1`.**

The code `M = 0` simply assigns the value `0` to the variable `M`. This does not affect the values of `s`, `e`, `P`, or `i`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial values from the initial state.
