Postcondition: `s` is an input integer, `e` is a non-empty string that is two characters shorter, `q` is the last character processed from `e`. If `P` is 2 and `M` is 0, then `q` equals '+', `P` remains 1, and `M` remains 2. Otherwise, if `P` is 0 and `M` is 2, then `q` equals '-', `P` remains 0, and `M` remains 1.
