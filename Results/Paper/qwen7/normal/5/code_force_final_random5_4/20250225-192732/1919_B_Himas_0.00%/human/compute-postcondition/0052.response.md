Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: We know the following from the previous iteration:
   - `P` is the total number of '+' characters in the string `e`.
   - `M` is the total number of characters in `e` that are not '+'.
   - `i` is equal to the length of `e` (since `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 with each iteration, it will be one more than the length of `e`).
   - `q` is the last character of `e`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `int(input())` iterations. This means the loop will run as long as the value of `i` is less than or equal to the integer input.

3. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 with each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - The value of `P` and `M` remain unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no operations are performed on these variables within the loop.
   - The value of `q` remains unchanged because the loop does not modify the string `e`.

Given that the loop runs for `int(input())` iterations and `i` starts at 1, the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to the integer input. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and still be less than or equal to the integer input.

Let's denote the integer input as `N`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to the length of `e` (let's call this length `L`). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be `L + 1` and still be less than or equal to `N`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `P` remains the same.
- `M` remains the same.
- `i` is incremented by 1, so it becomes `L + 1`.
- `q` remains the same.

Since we don't know the exact length `L` of the string `e` or the integer input `N`, we express the state in terms of these unknowns.

**State:**
- `P` is the total number of '+' characters in the string `e`.
- `M` is the total number of characters in `e` that are not '+'.
- `i` is `L + 1`, where `L` is the length of the string `e`.
- `q` is the last character of `e`.

However, since `L` is the length of `e` and `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1, `i` will be `len(e) + 1` at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, we can simplify this to:

**State:**
- `P` is the total number of '+' characters in the string `e`.
- `M` is the total number of characters in `e` that are not '+'.
- `i` is `len(e) + 1`.
- `q` is the last character of `e`.

So, the final state is:
State: **`P` is the total number of '+' characters in the string `e`, `M` is the total number of characters in `e` that are not '+', `i` is `len(e) + 1`, and `q` is the last character of `e`**.
