Output State: **`P` is the total number of '+' characters in the string `e`. `M` is the total number of characters in `e` that are not '+'. `i` is `len(e) + 1`. `q` is the last character of `e`. `s` is an input integer.**

The code `s = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to the variable `s`. The initial values of `P`, `M`, `i`, and `q` remain unchanged.
