Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and the value of `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postconditions are:
   - `s` is an input integer (this value does not change within the loop).
   - `e` is an empty string.
   - `P` is the total number of '+' characters encountered in `e` (initially 0).
   - `M` is the total number of '-' characters encountered in `e` (initially 0).

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `int(input())` iterations. The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue if `i < int(input())`.
   - After the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1, so `i` is now `previous_i + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `int(input())`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be `previous_i + 1`.
   - `int(input())` remains the same as it is the input value from the user and does not change within the loop.

Given the above points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is `previous_i + 1`.
- `int(input())` remains the same.
- `e` is still an empty string.
- `P` is still 0.
- `M` is still 0.

Since the loop condition depends on `i` and `int(input())`, and the other variables (`e`, `P`, `M`) remain unchanged, the updated state is:

**State: **`s` is an input integer, `e` is an empty string, `P` is 0, `M` is 0, and `i` is `previous_i + 1` and `int(input())` remains the same.**
