Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in the input string but does not split the string into non-empty arrays and calculate the penalties as described. Instead, it simply outputs the difference between the count of '+' and '-' characters, which does not reflect the actual penalty calculation.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
+-+
-++
--+
```

The expected output would be:
```
0
2
4
```

However, the program will output:
```
0
1
1
```

This is because the program only counts the number of '+' and '-' characters without splitting the string into arrays and calculating the penalties. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
