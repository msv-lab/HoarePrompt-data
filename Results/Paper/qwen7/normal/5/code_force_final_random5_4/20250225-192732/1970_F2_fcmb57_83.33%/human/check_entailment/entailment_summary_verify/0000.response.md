### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to evaluate its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Description and Requirements:
- The program needs to simulate a Quidditch game where players move, catch the Quaffle, and throw it into the opposing team's goal.
- If a player carrying the Quaffle is eliminated, the Quaffle remains on the cell containing both the player and the Bludger.
- The program should output the sequence of events and the final score.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes the field dimensions, players, goals, and the Quaffle's position.
   - Players and goals are stored in dictionaries and lists respectively.
   - The middle of the field is calculated and stored.

2. **Main Loop:**
   - The program iterates over the number of steps specified in the input.
   - For each step, it processes the action taken by the entity (player or ball).
   - If an entity moves (`ULDR`), its position is updated.
   - If a player catches the Quaffle (`C`), the Quaffle's position is updated to the player's position.
   - If a player throws the Quaffle (`T`), the Quaffle is released, and the player's position is reset to the middle of the field if they were in a goal.
   - If a player is eliminated, the program prints the elimination event and updates the Quaffle's position accordingly.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function updates the position of a player based on the direction specified.
   - It correctly calculates the new position by adding the direction vector to the current position.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function `func_1` takes a tuple `(x, y)` and a string `b` representing a direction.
- It splits the string `b` into `dx` and `dy`.
- It returns the new position `(x + dx, y + dy)`.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- The program correctly handles the movement of players and the Quaffle.
- The program correctly updates the Quaffle's position when a player throws it.
- The program correctly handles the elimination of a player carrying the Quaffle by updating the Quaffle's position to the cell containing both the player and the Bludger.
- The program outputs the events in the correct order and format.
- The final score is correctly calculated and printed.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the rules described in the problem statement. The original assessment incorrectly identified a scenario that the program actually handles correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
