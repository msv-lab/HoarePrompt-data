Output State: **`i` is 5, `x` is an integer value which is the remainder of `a[5]` divided by 10, and `len(a)` must be greater than 5.**

Explanation: The code assigns the last digit of the list element at index `i` (which is 5) to `x` after converting it to an integer using the modulo operator `%`. Since the initial state requires `len(a)` to be greater than 5, this condition remains valid. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 5, and `x` is updated to the last digit of `a[5]`.
