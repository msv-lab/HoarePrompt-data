You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

    #State: All elements in the list `a` have been processed, `x` is the last digit of `a[len(a)-1]` if `a[len(a)-1]` is greater than 10 and `len(a) > 0`, otherwise `x` is 0, `y` is the integer division of `a[len(a)-1]` by 10, `n` is the total number of elements added to the list `c` during the loop, `c` contains the processed elements according to the rules defined in the loop, and `i` is equal to `len(a)`.
    d = sorted(c)
    if (c == d) :
        b.append(1)
    else :
        b.append(0)
    #State: `d` is a sorted version of `c`, `c` contains the processed elements according to the rules defined in the loop, `n` is the total number of elements added to the list `c` during the loop, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `x` is the last digit of `a[len(a)-1]` if `a[len(a)-1]` is greater than 10 and `len(a) > 0`, otherwise `x` is 0, `y` is the integer division of `a[len(a)-1]` by 10, and `b` contains the element 0 if `c` is not equal to `d`, otherwise `b` contains the element 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer n followed by n integers. It constructs a list `c` based on specific rules involving the last digits and integer divisions of these integers. After processing, it sorts the list `c` and checks if the original list `c` is equal to its sorted version. If they are equal, it appends 1 to the list `b`; otherwise, it appends 0. The function ultimately returns the list `b` which contains 1s and 0s indicating whether each test case resulted in a sorted list `c`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the input and logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program reads the entire input into a list `b` outside of the loop, which means `b` will only contain the result of the last test case. This leads to incorrect output for multiple test cases.

Additionally, the logic within `func_1()` does not correctly implement the described operation. It attempts to split numbers greater than 10 into their individual digits and reinsert them, but it does not ensure that the resulting array is sorted. The logic for checking if the array is sorted (`c == d`) is also flawed because it does not account for the possibility of the array being modified during the sorting process.

To fix this, the program should:
1. Read and process each test case separately.
2. Implement the logic to split numbers greater than 10 and reinsert the digits.
3. Check if the resulting array is sorted after each operation.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
m = int(input())
results = []

for _ in range(m):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    def func_1():
        c = []
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] > 10:
                x = int(a[i] % 10)
                y = int(a[i] // 10)
                if i == 0:
                    if y <= x:
                        c.extend([y, x])
                    else:
                        c.append(a[i])
                else:
                    if y >= c[-1]:
                        if y <= x:
                            c.extend([y, x])
                        else:
                            c.append(a[i])
                    else:
                        c.append(a[i])
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
        return c
    
    c = func_1()
    if c == sorted(c):
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This corrected version processes each test case separately and ensures that the array is sorted after applying the operation.
