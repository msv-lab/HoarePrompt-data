Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is the last digit of `a[i]` if `a[i]` is greater than 10 and `i > 0`, otherwise `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` is 3, `c` is a list containing either 0 and `x` or the element `a[0]` if `a[0]` is greater than 10, otherwise `c` is a list containing the element `a[0]`, `i` is 4, `len(a)` is greater than 0, and `c` has appended `x`. If `y` is less than or equal to `x`, `n` is 3, `c` has appended `x`, and `i` is 4. Otherwise, `n` is 2, `c` now contains the additional element `a[2]`, and `i` is 3.**
