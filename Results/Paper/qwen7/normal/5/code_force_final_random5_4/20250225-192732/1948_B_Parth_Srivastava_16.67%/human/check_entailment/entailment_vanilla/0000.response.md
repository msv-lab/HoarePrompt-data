Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `m`.
   - It initializes an empty list `b` to store results.
   - It iterates over each test case but calls `func_1()` without passing any parameters, which seems incorrect.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - Reads the size of the array `k`.
   - Reads the array elements as a string and converts them to integers.
   - Initializes variables `x`, `y`, `n`, and `c` (list to store processed elements).
   - Iterates through each element of the array:
     - If the element is greater than 10 and not the first element:
       - Extracts the last digit (`x`) and the rest of the number (`y`).
       - Checks if `y` is greater than or equal to the last element in `c`.
         - If `y` is less than or equal to `x`, splits the number into digits and appends them to `c`.
         - Otherwise, directly appends the original number to `c`.
     - If the element is the first element and greater than 10:
       - Extracts the last digit (`x`) and the rest of the number (`y`).
       - Checks if `y` is less than or equal to `x`, splitting the number accordingly.
     - Otherwise, appends the element to `c` as is.
   - Sorts the list `c` and checks if it matches the original list `a`.
   - Appends `1` to `b` if `c` is sorted, otherwise appends `0`.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The main loop should iterate over each test case and call `func_1(i)` with the index `i` to correctly process each test case.
   - Instead, it calls `func_1()` without parameters, which is incorrect.

### Correctness Check:

- The logic inside `func_1` appears to correctly implement the problem's requirements.
- However, the main loop is incorrect because it does not pass the index `i` to `func_1`.

### Corrected Program:

```python
m = int(input())
b = []
for i in range(m):
    func_1(i)

for i in range(m):
    if b[i] == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

def func_1(i):
    k = int(input())
    a = input().strip()
    a = list(map(int, a.split()))
    x = 0
    y = 0
    n = 0
    c = []
    for j in range(len(a)):
        if a[j] > 10 and j > 0:
            x = int(a[j] % 10)
            y = int(a[j] / 10)
            if y >= c[n - 1]:
                if y <= x:
                    c.append(y)
                    c.append(x)
                    n = n + 2
                else:
                    c.append(a[j])
                    n = n + 1
        elif j == 0 and a[j] > 10:
            x = int(a[j] % 10)
            y = int(a[j] / 10)
            if y <= x:
                c.append(y)
                c.append(x)
                n = n + 2
            else:
                c.append(a[j])
                n = n + 1
        else:
            c.append(a[j])
            n = n + 1
    d = sorted(c)
    if c == d:
        b.append(1)
    else:
        b.append(0)
```

### Conclusion:

The given program is incorrect due to the main loop calling `func_1()` without passing the index `i`. After correcting this, the program should work as expected.

**Correctness: False**
