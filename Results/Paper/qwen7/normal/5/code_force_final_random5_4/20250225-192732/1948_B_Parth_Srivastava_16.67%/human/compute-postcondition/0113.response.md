Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input through a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99). For each test case, the function returns a result based on the provided data.**

Given the constraints, the function likely iterates over multiple test cases, each containing an integer n and a list of n integers. However, since the function signature does not explicitly show any parameters, the description focuses on the input structure and expected output without detailing the processing logic.
