Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`, `y` is 0, and if `y` is greater than or equal to the last element of `c` (where `n` is the index of `c`), then either `n` is 2 and `c` is a list containing the value `x`, or `n` is 1 and `c` is a list containing one additional element which is `a[i]`. If `y` is less than the last element of `c`, then the conditions for `n` and `c` remain unchanged.
