Postcondition: `i` is 5, `x` is an integer value which is the remainder of `a[5]` divided by 10, `y` is `a[5]` divided by 10 as an integer, `c` contains either `[y, x]` or the element `a[5]` depending on whether `y` is less than or equal to `x`, and `n` is adjusted to `n + 2` if `y <= x` and `n + 1` otherwise. If `i == 0` and `a[5] > 10`, then `x` is `a[5] % 10`, `y` is `a[5] // 10`, and `c` contains either `[y, x]` if `y <= x` or `a[5]` if `y > x`, with `n` being either `n + 2` or `n + 1`.
