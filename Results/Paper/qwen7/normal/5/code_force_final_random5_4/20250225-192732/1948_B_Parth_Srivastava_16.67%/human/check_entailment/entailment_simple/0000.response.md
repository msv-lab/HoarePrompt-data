Reasoning:

1. The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1()` processes the array but does not check if the resulting array can be sorted in non-decreasing order after performing the allowed operations.

2. The main issue lies in the fact that the program does not actually perform the digit splitting operation on the array elements. Instead, it seems to be checking if the array can be sorted without performing any operations, which is not what the problem requires.

3. The variable `b` is used to store whether each test case can be sorted, but the logic to determine this is flawed. The function `func_1()` should simulate the digit splitting operation and then check if the resulting array is sorted.

4. The program reads the input for multiple test cases but only processes one test case per iteration of the loop. This means it does not handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem statement.

5. The program does not correctly simulate the digit splitting operation and does not check if the resulting array can be sorted after performing the operations.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
