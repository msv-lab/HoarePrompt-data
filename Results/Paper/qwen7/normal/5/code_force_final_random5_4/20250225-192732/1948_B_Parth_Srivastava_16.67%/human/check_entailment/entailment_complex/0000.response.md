Reasoning:
1. The annotated program attempts to solve the problem by processing each test case and determining if the resulting list `c` after applying the specified operations can be sorted.
2. The main issues with the annotated program are:
   - The function `func_1()` does not correctly handle the input format for each test case.
   - The logic for constructing the list `c` is flawed and does not fully capture the problem's requirements.
   - The program does not actually sort the original array `a` but instead constructs a new list `c` based on the operations described.
   - The program does not correctly check if the original array `a` can be transformed into a sorted array through the described operations.
3. The program should:
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read the length `n` and the array `a`.
   - Apply the operations to transform the array `a` and check if it can be sorted.
   - Print "YES" if the array can be sorted, otherwise print "NO".

Given these points, the annotated program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
