Output State: **`i` is 5, `x` is an integer value which is the remainder of `a[5]` divided by 10, `y` is `a[5]` divided by 10 as an integer, and `c` contains `[y]`.**

Explanation: The code `c.append(y)` appends the value of `y` to the list `c`. Since `y` is already defined as `a[5] // 10`, appending it to `c` means `c` now contains `[y]`. The values of `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
