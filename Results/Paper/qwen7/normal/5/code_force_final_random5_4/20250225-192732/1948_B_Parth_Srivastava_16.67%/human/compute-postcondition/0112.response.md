Postcondition: **`d` is a sorted version of `c`, `c` contains the processed elements according to the rules defined in the loop, `n` is the total number of elements added to the list `c` during the loop, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `x` is the last digit of `a[len(a)-1]` if `a[len(a)-1]` is greater than 10 and `len(a) > 0`, otherwise `x` is 0, `y` is the integer division of `a[len(a)-1]` by 10, and `b` contains the element 0 if `c` is not equal to `d`, otherwise `b` contains the element 1.**
