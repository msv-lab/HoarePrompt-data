Output State: **`i` is 5, `x` is an integer value equal to `a[5] % 10`, `y` is `a[5] // 10`, `c` is a list with the element `a[5]` appended.**

Explanation: The code `c.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` (where `i` is 5) to the list `c`. The values of `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
