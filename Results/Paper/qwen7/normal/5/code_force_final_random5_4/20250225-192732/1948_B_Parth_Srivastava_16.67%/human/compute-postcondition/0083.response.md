Output State: **`i` is 5; `x` is an integer value which is the remainder of `a[5]` divided by 10; `y` is `a[5]` divided by 10 as an integer; `c` contains the element `a[5]`.**

Explanation: The code `c.append(a[i])` appends the element `a[5]` to the list `c`. The values of `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still 5, `x` remains as the remainder of `a[5]` divided by 10, and `y` remains as `a[5]` divided by 10 as an integer. The list `c` now includes the element `a[5]`.
