Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers, `x` is the last digit of `a[i]` if `a[i]` is greater than 10 and `i > 0`, otherwise `x` is 0, `y` is 1 if `a[i]` is greater than 10 and `i > 0`, otherwise `y` is 0, `n` is 4 if `a[i]` is greater than 10 and `i > 0`, otherwise `n` is 1, `c` is a list containing `x` and `y`, `i` is 4, `y` is updated to be the integer division of `a[3]` by 10, and if `y` is greater than or equal to the last element of `c`, `c` contains `x` and `y`; otherwise, `c` remains as a list containing `0` and `x` or the element `a[0]` if `a[0]` is greater than 10, otherwise `c` is a list containing the element `a[0]`.
