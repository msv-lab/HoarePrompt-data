Output State: **`i` is 1; `len_unique` must be greater than 0; `char_map[unique_chars[0]]` is equal to `unique_chars[len_unique - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]` to `char_map[unique_chars[i]]`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `char_map[unique_chars[0]]` is set to `unique_chars[len_unique - 1]`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 after the assignment, making `i` equal to 1. The condition that `len_unique` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
