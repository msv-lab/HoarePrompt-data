The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `encoded`. `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length `n` satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The function returns a string `decoded` where each character in `encoded` is replaced by its corresponding character from the end of `unique_chars` as per the mapping defined in `char_map`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `encoded` and returns a new string `decoded` where each character in `encoded` is mapped to its corresponding character from the end of `unique_chars` based on the mapping defined in `char_map`.**
