You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The string encoded is the result of encoding some original string s using the specified algorithm.
def func_1(encoded):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    char_map = {}
    len_unique = len(unique_chars)
    for i in range(len_unique):
        char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is equal to `len_unique`; `len_unique` must be greater than 0; for every key `k` in `char_map`, `char_map[k]` is equal to `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all the iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will be equal to `len_unique`. The dictionary `char_map` will map each character in `unique_chars` to its corresponding character from the end of the list, such that `char_map[unique_chars[i]]` will be `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]` for all valid indices `i`. This means that each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to its mirror image from the end of the list.
    decoded = ''.join(char_map[ch] for ch in encoded)
    return decoded
    #The program returns a string `decoded` where each character is replaced by its corresponding character from the end of `unique_chars` as per the mapping defined in `char_map`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a string `encoded` and returns a new string `decoded` where each character in `encoded` is mapped to its corresponding character from the end of `unique_chars` based on the mapping defined in `char_map`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a string `decoded` where each character is replaced by its corresponding character from the end of `unique_chars` as per the mapping defined in `char_map`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
