Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
2. The function `func_1` is designed to decode a string that was previously encoded according to the specified algorithm.
3. The function first creates a sorted list of unique characters from the encoded string.
4. It then creates a mapping (`char_map`) where each character is paired with its corresponding character from the end of the unique characters list.
5. Finally, it uses this mapping to decode the encoded string by replacing each character in the encoded string with its corresponding character from the end of the unique characters list.
6. The implementation logic matches the problem description and the expected behavior.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
