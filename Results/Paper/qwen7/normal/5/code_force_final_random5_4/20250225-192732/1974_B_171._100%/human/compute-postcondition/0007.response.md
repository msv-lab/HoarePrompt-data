Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for i in range(len_unique)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `len_unique`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < len_unique`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 3
   - `len_unique` must be greater than 0
   - `char_map[unique_chars[3]]` is equal to `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - 3]`

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 4.
   - `len_unique` must still be greater than 0 (it does not change within the loop).
   - The condition `char_map[unique_chars[3]]` is equal to `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - 3]` remains unchanged because it is an invariant condition that holds true for each iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 4, `len_unique` must be greater than 0, `char_map[unique_chars[3]]` is equal to `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - 3]`**
