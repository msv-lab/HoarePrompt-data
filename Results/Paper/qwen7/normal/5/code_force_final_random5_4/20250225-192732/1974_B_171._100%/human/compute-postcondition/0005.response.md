Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for i in range(len_unique)`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `len_unique`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len_unique`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `len_unique` must be greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - `len_unique` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration because the loop condition does not change `len_unique`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `len_unique` must be greater than 0, `char_map[unique_chars[0]]` is equal to `unique_chars[len_unique - 1]`**
