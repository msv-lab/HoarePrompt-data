Reasoning:
The given program aims to find the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed from the given sticks. The logic implemented in `func_1` is to count the frequency of each stick length and then calculate how many polygons can be formed by dividing the frequency of each length by 3 (since each polygon needs at least 3 sides).

However, there are a few issues with the current implementation:
1. The function `func_1` does not handle cases where the minimum required length for a polygon (which is 3) is not present in the stick lengths.
2. The function assumes that any stick length can form a polygon, which is not necessarily true. For example, if all sticks are of length 2, they can only form triangles (if available in sufficient quantity), but the code does not account for this.

Given the execution summary, the program only counts the frequency of each stick length and divides by 3, which is not sufficient to correctly determine the number of polygons that can be formed. It does not check if there are enough sticks of the same length to form at least one polygon.

Therefore, the current implementation is incomplete and incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
