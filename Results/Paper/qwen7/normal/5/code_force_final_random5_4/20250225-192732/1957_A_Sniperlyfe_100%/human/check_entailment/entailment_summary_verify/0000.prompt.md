You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    return sum((v // 3 for v in freq.values()))



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list of integers where the first element is the number of sticks available, and the subsequent elements are the lengths of those sticks. It calculates the frequency of each stick length (excluding the first element) and stores these frequencies in a dictionary. Finally, it returns the sum of the integer division of each frequency by 3.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle cases where multiple polygons can be formed using different sets of sticks. Specifically, the program only counts the number of triangles (since `v // 3` is used) that can be formed, but it does not account for the possibility of forming other types of polygons (e.g., squares, pentagons, etc.) with the remaining sticks after forming triangles.

For example, consider the input:
```
9
4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4
```
The program will only count the number of triangles that can be formed, which is 2 (since there are 8 twos and 4 fours, and `8 // 3 = 2` and `4 // 3 = 1`). However, a better solution would be to form one square (with four sides of length 4) and one triangle (with three sides of length 2), resulting in a total of 2 polygons.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirement of finding the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed simultaneously.
