Output State: **`arr` must have at least one element, `n` is the second element of `arr` if it exists, `freq` is a dictionary with the key `n` and value 2**

Explanation: The code updates the frequency count of `n` in the dictionary `freq`. Since `freq` initially had the key `n` with a value of 1, after executing `freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1`, the value of `freq[n]` is incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
