Output State: **`arr` must have at least one element, `n` is the third element of `arr` if it exists, `freq` is a dictionary with the key `n` and value 4**

Explanation: The code updates the frequency of `n` in the dictionary `freq`. Initially, `freq[n]` is set to 3. The line `freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1` retrieves the current value of `freq[n]` (which is 3), adds 1 to it, and then assigns the new value back to `freq[n]`. Therefore, `freq[n]` becomes 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
