Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all its iterations is a dictionary `freq` where each key is an integer from the list `arr` (excluding the first element which represents the count of sticks), and the corresponding value for each key is the total count of occurrences of that integer in `arr`.

In more detail, if `arr` contains integers like `[5, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]`, then `freq` will be `{2: 2, 3: 3}` because `2` appears twice and `3` appears three times in the list. The first element `5` is not included as a key in `freq` since it was the count of how many sticks there were initially, not one of the stick lengths.
