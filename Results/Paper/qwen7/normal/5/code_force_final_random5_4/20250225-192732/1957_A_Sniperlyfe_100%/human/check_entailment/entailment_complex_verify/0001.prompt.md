You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    return sum((v // 3 for v in freq.values()))



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the first element is the number of sticks available (n), and the subsequent elements are the lengths of the sticks (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). Each stick length is a positive integer not exceeding 100, and the number of sticks (n) is a positive integer not exceeding 100.
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all its iterations is a dictionary `freq` where each key is an integer from the list `arr` (excluding the first element which represents the count of sticks), and the corresponding value for each key is the total count of occurrences of that integer in `arr`.
    #
    #In more detail, if `arr` contains integers like `[5, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]`, then `freq` will be `{2: 2, 3: 3}` because `2` appears twice and `3` appears three times in the list. The first element `5` is not included as a key in `freq` since it was the count of how many sticks there were initially, not one of the stick lengths.
    return sum(v // 3 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the dictionary `freq` by 3.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers where the first element is the number of sticks available, and the subsequent elements are the lengths of those sticks. It calculates the frequency of each stick length (excluding the first element) and stores these frequencies in a dictionary. Finally, it returns the sum of the integer division of each frequency by 3.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the lengths of the sticks `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list of stick lengths `arr`.
   - It uses a dictionary `freq` to count the frequency of each stick length.
   - It then calculates the total number of regular polygons by dividing the frequency of each stick length by 3 (since each polygon has 3 sides) and summing these values.

### Problem Description and Requirements

- We need to find the maximum number of regular polygons (triangles) that can be formed such that each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick and no stick is used in more than one polygon.
- A regular polygon with `k` sides requires `k` sticks of the same length.
- Therefore, for each unique stick length, we can form as many triangles as the integer division of the count of that stick length by 3.

### Function `func_1` Analysis

- The function correctly counts the frequency of each stick length using a dictionary.
- It then divides the frequency of each stick length by 3 to determine how many triangles can be formed with that stick length.
- Finally, it sums these values to get the total number of triangles that can be formed.

### Example Verification

Let's verify the function with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `[1]`
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: Only one stick, not enough to form a triangle.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `[1, 1]`
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: Two sticks, not enough to form a triangle.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: `[2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3]`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Four sticks of length 3 can form one triangle.

4. **Example 4**:
   - Input: `[4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 4, 4]`
   - Output: `2`
   - Explanation: Two sets of four sticks can form two triangles (one with side length 2 and one with side length 4).

### Conclusion

The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed from the given stick lengths. It handles all edge cases and examples provided.
