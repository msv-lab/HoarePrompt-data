Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `x` is an integer.
   - `y` is `y - 1`.
   - `max_val` remains unchanged.
   - If `x` is divisible by `y`, then `max_val` is `y - 1`. Otherwise, `max_val` remains as its original value.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for y in range(x - 1, 1, -1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over `y` starting from `x - 1` down to `2` (since `range(x - 1, 1, -1)` means `x-1, x-2, ..., 2`).
   - The loop variable `y` is adjusted within the loop itself, but the initial value of `y` at the start of the loop is `x - 1`.

4. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop starts with `y = x - 1` and decreases by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `y` will be `x - 2`.
   - `x` remains unchanged.
   - `max_val` remains unchanged as per the postcondition.

5. **Final State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `x` is still an integer.
   - `y` is now `x - 2`.
   - `max_val` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`x` is an integer, `y` is `x - 2`, `max_val` remains unchanged**.
