Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \leq y < x \)) such that the value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized. The function `func_1` is supposed to implement this logic.

2. **Function Logic Analysis**:
   - The function iterates over all integers \( y \) from \( x-1 \) down to 2.
   - It checks if \( x \% y == 0 \), meaning \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \).
   - If \( y \) is a divisor and \( 2y \geq x \), it returns \( y \) immediately because this condition ensures \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
   - Otherwise, it updates `max_val` with the current \( y \).

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The loop starts from \( x-1 \) and goes down to 2, ensuring \( y < x \).
   - The condition \( 2y \geq x \) ensures that the value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized when \( y \) is the largest possible divisor of \( x \) that satisfies the condition.

4. **Return Value**:
   - If no \( y \) satisfying \( 2y \geq x \) is found, the function returns the last updated `max_val`, which would be 1 (since the loop will eventually reach 2 and stop).

5. **Output Validation**:
   - Given the constraints \( 2 \leq x \leq 1000 \), the function should always find a valid \( y \) and return it correctly.

Given the above analysis, the function logic aligns with the problem requirements and constraints. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
