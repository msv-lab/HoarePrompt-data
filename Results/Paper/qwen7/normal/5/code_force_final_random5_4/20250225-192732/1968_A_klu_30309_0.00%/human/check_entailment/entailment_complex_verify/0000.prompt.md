You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

    #State: x is an integer, y is 1, and max_val remains unchanged.
    return max_val
    #The program returns max_val which remains unchanged from its initial state.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer x within the range of 2 to 1000 and returns an integer y. The function aims to find the y that maximizes the expression gcd(x, y) + y. Specifically, it returns:
- y if x is divisible by y and 2 * y is greater than or equal to x,
- x - 1 if no such y is found,
- x - 2 if no suitable y is found and y cannot be x - 1,
- 1 if no suitable y is found and y cannot be x - 1 or x - 2.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not always find the correct value of \( y \) that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\). 

Consider the test case \( x = 10 \):
- The program checks values of \( y \) from \( x-1 \) down to 2.
- For \( y = 5 \), \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10\).
- For \( y = 6 \), \(\gcd(10, 6) + 6 = 2 + 6 = 8\).

The program returns \( y = 5 \) because it finds the first \( y \) that satisfies \( x \% y == 0 \) and \( 2 * y \geq x \). However, the maximum value of \(\gcd(10, y) + y\) is actually achieved when \( y = 5 \), but the program might return a different value if it encounters another \( y \) that satisfies the conditions earlier.

For instance, if we consider \( x = 12 \):
- The program would check values of \( y \) from 11 down to 2.
- For \( y = 6 \), \(\gcd(12, 6) + 6 = 6 + 6 = 12\).
- For \( y = 4 \), \(\gcd(12, 4) + 4 = 4 + 4 = 8\).

The program returns \( y = 6 \), but the correct value of \( y \) that maximizes \(\gcd(12, y) + y\) is also \( y = 6 \). However, the program's logic might not always find the correct \( y \) depending on the order in which it checks the values.

Thus, the program does not guarantee finding the optimal \( y \) for every input, making it incorrect.
