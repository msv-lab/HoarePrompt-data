Reasoning:

1. **Function Logic Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to find the value of \( y \) that maximizes the expression \(\text{gcd}(x, y) + y\).
   - It iterates over all possible values of \( y \) from \( x-1 \) down to 2.
   - If \( x \) is divisible by \( y \) and \( 2y \geq x \), it immediately returns \( y \).
   - If no such \( y \) is found, it returns \( x-1 \).

2. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where \( y = x-1 \) and checks if \( 2y \geq x \). This ensures that the maximum possible value of \( y \) is considered.
   - The function also handles the case where no suitable \( y \) is found, returning \( x-1 \) in such scenarios.

3. **Output Validation**:
   - Given the constraints \( 2 \leq x \leq 1000 \), the function's logic should work correctly for all valid inputs.
   - The provided examples in the annotated program match the expected behavior of the function.

4. **Code Review**:
   - The code is logically sound and follows the problem requirements.
   - The function correctly identifies the largest \( y \) that maximizes \(\text{gcd}(x, y) + y\) under the given constraints.

Conclusion:
The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the value of \( y \) that maximizes \(\text{gcd}(x, y) + y\) for the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
