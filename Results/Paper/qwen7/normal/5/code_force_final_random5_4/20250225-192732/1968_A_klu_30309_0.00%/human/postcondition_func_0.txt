The function accepts an integer x within the range of 2 to 1000 and returns an integer y. The function aims to find the y that maximizes the expression gcd(x, y) + y. Specifically, it returns:
- y if x is divisible by y and 2 * y is greater than or equal to x,
- x - 1 if no such y is found,
- x - 2 if no suitable y is found and y cannot be x - 1,
- 1 if no suitable y is found and y cannot be x - 1 or x - 2.
