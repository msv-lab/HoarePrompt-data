Output State: **x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000; y is 1**

Explanation: The provided code snippet is a docstring for a function that aims to find the value of `y` that maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y`. However, no actual code is provided to execute the logic of finding `y`. In the absence of executable code, the only information we can infer is that the function returns `y` which, in the context of maximizing `gcd(x, y) + y`, would logically be `1` because the greatest common divisor (gcd) of any number with `1` is `1`, and adding `y` itself (`1`) results in the highest possible value for `gcd(x, y) + y` when `y` is `1`. Therefore, `y` is set to `1` by the function, and the precondition that `x` is an integer between `2` and `1000` remains unchanged.
