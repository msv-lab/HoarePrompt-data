Based on the initial state provided:

- `no` is `True`.
- `tests` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 2.
- `c` is a non-empty string.
- `x` is the last character in the string `c`.
- `b` is the new input string from the user.
- `slength` is an input integer.
- `counter` is equal to the length of the string `c`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'NO'`. Since there are no variables or expressions evaluated within the print statement, it simply outputs the string as it is.

Output: **NO**
