Postcondition: `c` is a non-empty string, `x` is the first character of `c`. If `x` is not in `a[counter]` and not in `b[counter]`, then `no` is False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `x` is in `a[counter]` or `b[counter]`, no changes are made to `no` and the loop or if statement continues as normal.
