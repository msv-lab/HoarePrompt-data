Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tests` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `tests` ≤ 1000.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(tests):
    slength = int(input())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    c = input()
    no = True
    if c == a or c == b:
        no = False
        print('NO')
    else:
        counter = 0
        for x in c:
            if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
                no = False
                print('YES')
                break
            counter += 1
    if no:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `no` is False, `tests` remains greater than 0, `i` remains 0, `c` has at least as many characters as the number of iterations the loop executed, `x` is the last character in the string `c`, the counter is equal to the length of `c` + 1, and `x` is not in `a[counter-1]` and `x` is not in `b[counter-1]`, causing the loop to break.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `no`'s value depends on whether `c` matches `a` or `b` during the loop's execution, `tests` remains greater than 0, `i` is 1, `c` is the input string from the user, `x` is the last character in the string `c`, the counter is equal to the length of `c` + 1, and `b` retains its original input value from the user. If the if condition evaluates to true, `no`'s value is determined based on whether `c` matches `a` or `b`. If the if condition evaluates to false, `no` retains its original value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is the input string from the user, `no` is True, `tests` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `c` is a non-empty string, `x` is the last character in the string `c`, `b` is the new input string from the user, `slength` is an input integer, and `counter` is equal to the length of string `c`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
