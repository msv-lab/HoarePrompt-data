Postcondition: `no` is False, `tests` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be 0; `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string from user, `c` is an input string. The current value of `c` is either equal to `a` or equal to `b`. If `c` equals `a` or `b`, `no` becomes False. Otherwise, after executing the loop, `no` remains False, `tests` remains greater than 0, `i` remains 0, `c` has at least as many characters as the number of iterations the loop executed, `x` is the last character in the string `c`, the counter is equal to the length of `c` + 1, and `x` is not in `a[counter-1]` and `x` is not in `b[counter-1]`, causing the loop to break.
