Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of the list is between 2 and 50; `sorted_lst` is a sorted version of `lst`.**

Explanation: The code sorts the list `lst` and assigns the sorted list to `sorted_lst`. The original properties of `lst` remain unchanged except that it is now sorted. The length and range of values in `lst` stay the same, but the order of elements changes.
