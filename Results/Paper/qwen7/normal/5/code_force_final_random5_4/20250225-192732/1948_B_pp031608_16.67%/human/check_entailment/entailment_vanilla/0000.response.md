Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.
   
2. **Main Logic:**
   - The program iterates over the array elements starting from the second element (`p`).
   - It checks if `func_1(list1)` returns `False`. If so, it proceeds to check if the previous element is greater than the current element and the previous element is greater than 10.
   - If the condition is met, it performs the operation to split the previous element into its digits and inserts them back into the array.
   - After performing the operation, it rechecks if the array is sorted using `func_1(list1)`.

3. **Sorting Check Function:**
   - The function `func_1(lst)` checks if the given list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it with its sorted version.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Operation Implementation:**
   - The program assumes that splitting a number into its digits and inserting them back into the array will always result in a sorted array. However, this is not necessarily true. For example, consider the array `[12, 3, 45, 67]`. Splitting `45` into `[4, 5]` and inserting them results in `[12, 3, 4, 5, 67]`, which is still not sorted.
   - The logic in the main loop does not correctly handle the splitting and reinsertion of digits to ensure the array becomes sorted.

2. **Function `func_1` Usage:**
   - The function `func_1(lst)` is used to check if the array is sorted. However, it only checks once after the operations. If the operations do not make the array sorted, the program will incorrectly print 'Yes'.

3. **Logic Flaw:**
   - The program does not guarantee that the array will become sorted even if the operations are performed. The logic to split and insert digits is flawed and does not ensure a sorted array.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to transform the array into a sorted one. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
