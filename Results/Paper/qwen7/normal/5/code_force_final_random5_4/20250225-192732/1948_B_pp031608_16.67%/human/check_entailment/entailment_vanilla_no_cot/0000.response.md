Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Function `func_1` is not defined**: The function `func_1` is called but not defined in the given code snippet. This would result in a `NameError`.

2. **Incorrect logic for checking and applying operations**: The logic inside the loop that checks and applies the operation is flawed. It does not properly simulate the described operation of splitting elements into their digits and inserting them back into the list.

3. **Incorrect handling of the operation**: The code attempts to split elements greater than 10 and insert their digits back into the list. However, it does not correctly handle the insertion of these digits in the right positions, and it does not ensure that the list is sorted after each operation.

4. **Incomplete implementation**: The code does not fully implement the logic required to check if the array can be sorted using the described operations. It only checks if the final list is sorted without performing the necessary operations.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to implement the logic to split elements greater than 10 into their digits and insert them back into the list while ensuring the list remains sorted. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Function to split a number into its digits and insert them back into the list
    def split_and_insert(num, index):
        digits = [int(d) for d in str(num)]
        list1.pop(index)
        for digit in digits[::-1]:
            list1.insert(index, digit)
    
    # Main logic to check and apply the operation
    modified = True
    while modified:
        modified = False
        for p in range(1, len(list1)):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] >= 10:
                split_and_insert(list1[p - 1], p - 1)
                modified = True
                break
    
    # Check if the list is sorted
    if list1 == sorted(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This code correctly implements the logic to split elements greater than 10 into their digits and insert them back into the list while ensuring the list remains sorted.
