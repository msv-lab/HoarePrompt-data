### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program. Let's break down the problems and verify the annotated code step by step.

1. **Incorrect Operation Implementation:**
   - The program assumes that splitting a number into its digits and inserting them back into the array will always result in a sorted array. This is not true. For example, consider the array `[12, 3, 45, 67]`. Splitting `45` into `[4, 5]` and inserting them results in `[12, 3, 4, 5, 67]`, which is still not sorted.

2. **Function `func_1` Usage:**
   - The function `func_1(lst)` is used to check if the array is sorted. However, it only checks once after the operations. If the operations do not make the array sorted, the program will incorrectly print 'Yes'.

3. **Logic Flaw:**
   - The program does not guarantee that the array will become sorted even if the operations are performed. The logic to split and insert digits is flawed and does not ensure a sorted array.

To validate these points, let's look at the annotated code and the examples provided:

- **Example 1:** `[12, 3, 45, 67]`
  - After splitting `45` into `[4, 5]`, the array becomes `[12, 3, 4, 5, 67]`.
  - The array is not sorted, but the program incorrectly prints 'Yes'.

- **Example 2:** `[12, 28, 5]`
  - There is no way to sort this array using the given operations, but the program incorrectly prints 'No'.

- **Example 3:** `[0, 0]`
  - The array is already sorted, and the program correctly prints 'Yes'.

From the above analysis, it is clear that the program does not correctly handle the splitting and reinsertion of digits to ensure the array becomes sorted. The logic in the main loop and the function `func_1` are flawed.

### Final Evaluation

Given the issues identified and the examples provided, the program is incorrect. The original assessment accurately points out the flaws in the program.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
