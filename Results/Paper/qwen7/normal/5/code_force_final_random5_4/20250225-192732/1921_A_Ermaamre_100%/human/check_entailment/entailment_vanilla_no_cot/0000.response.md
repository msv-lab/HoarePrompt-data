Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the area of the square given the coordinates of its corners. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners and stores them in a list of lists `a`.
3. It extracts the x-coordinates into a list `x`.
4. It calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (`dx`), which gives the side length of the square.
5. Finally, it prints the square of `dx`, which is the area of the square.

Given the constraints and the guarantee that the points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, this approach will always yield the correct area.
