Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of 4 lists, each containing integers entered by the user; `x` is a list of the first elements from each of the 4 lists in `a`; `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`. The values of `t`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged. The new variable `dx` is assigned the value of `max(x) - min(x)`.
