Output State: **`t` is 0, `a` is a list of 4 lists, each containing integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code creates a 2D list `a` with 4 rows. Each row is populated by integers entered by the user using `input().split()`. Since the initial value of `t` is 0 and no operation changes its value, `t` remains 0. The list `a` is constructed based on the input provided by the user, but without specific input values, we can only describe it as a list of 4 lists, each containing integers.
