Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates.
3. It extracts the x-coordinates and calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (`dx`), which represents the side length of the square since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes.
4. The area of the square is calculated as `dx * dx`, which is correct.
5. The program prints the area for each test case as required.
6. The program handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem statement.

Given the above points, the program appears to follow the problem description accurately and produces the expected output based on the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
