Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user, which represents the number of test cases. This integer is stored in the variable `t`. The initial state of other variables remains unchanged, but since no other variables are mentioned in the initial state, we only update `t` with the value of the number of test cases entered by the user.
