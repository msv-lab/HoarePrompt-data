Reasoning:
The given program correctly implements the logic to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Storing Coordinates**: For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates and stores them in a list `a`.
3. **Extracting X-coordinates**: It extracts the x-coordinates of the points into a list `x`.
4. **Calculating Side Length**: The side length of the square is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (`dx = max(x) - min(x)`).
5. **Outputting Area**: Finally, it prints the area of the square, which is the side length squared (`dx * dx`).

Given the problem constraints and the provided example, the program correctly identifies the side length of the square by considering only the x-coordinates (or y-coordinates, since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes). This approach is valid because the distance between the farthest left and right points (or top and bottom points) will always give the side length of the square.

Since the program follows the correct logic and handles all given constraints and examples properly, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
