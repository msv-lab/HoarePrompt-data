Output State: **The program returns 11, where `result` is 6 and `size` is 5.**

Explanation: The loop runs from `i` starting at 4 up to `size` which is 5. Therefore, the loop will run 6 times in total (from 4 to 9 inclusive). Each iteration increments `i` by 1, so after 6 iterations, `i` becomes 7. However, the loop also increments `result` by 1 in each iteration, making `result` equal to 6 after 6 iterations. The return statement then calculates `size + result`, which is `5 + 6 = 11`.
