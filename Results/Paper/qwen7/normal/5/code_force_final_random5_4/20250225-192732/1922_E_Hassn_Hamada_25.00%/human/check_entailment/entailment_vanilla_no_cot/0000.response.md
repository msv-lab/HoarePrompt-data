Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Increasing Subsequences**: The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence such that the number of increasing subsequences matches the input `n`. However, the logic in `func_1` is flawed. It does not correctly generate sequences that match the required number of increasing subsequences.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Test Cases**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. However, the logic within `func_1` does not correctly compute the sequence for the given `X`.

3. **Assertions and Logic Errors**: The assertions in `func_1` do not align with the intended logic and may fail for certain values of `number`.

4. **Output Format**: The program prints the length of the sequence followed by the sequence itself. However, the logic to generate the sequence is incorrect, leading to wrong outputs.

To correctly solve this problem, one would need to use a more sophisticated approach, possibly involving combinatorial mathematics or dynamic programming to ensure the number of increasing subsequences matches the given `X`. The current implementation does not achieve this.
