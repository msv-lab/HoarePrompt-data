Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(size)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `size`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 5
   - `size` is 5
   - `sequence` has its element at index `-result - i - 1` incremented by `result`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `size`. Given that `i` is currently 5 and `size` is 5, the loop will not execute again because `i` is already equal to `size`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop does not execute again, `i` remains 5.
   - `size` remains 5.
   - No changes are needed for `sequence` because the loop did not run.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which in this case does not occur) would remain the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 5, `size` is 5, `sequence` has its element at index `-result - i - 1` incremented by `result`**
