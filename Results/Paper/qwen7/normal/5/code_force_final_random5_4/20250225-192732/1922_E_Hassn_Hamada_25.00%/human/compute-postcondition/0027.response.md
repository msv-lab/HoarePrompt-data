Output State: **`i` is 5, `size` is 5, the element at index `-result - i - 1` in `sequence` is incremented by `result`**.

This means that the element in the `sequence` list at the index calculated by `-result - i - 1` (where `i` is 5) has been incremented by the value of `result`. The values of `i` and `size` remain unchanged.
