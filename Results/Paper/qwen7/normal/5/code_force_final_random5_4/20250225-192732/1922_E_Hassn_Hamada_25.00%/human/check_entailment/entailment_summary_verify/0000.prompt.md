You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

    assert number >= 0
    if number == 0:

    while (1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number:

    for i in range(size):
        sequence.append(i)
    result = func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)
    for i in range(size):
        assert -len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1

    return size + result



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `number`, a positive integer, and `sequence`, a list of integers. It generates a sequence of integers and modifies the `sequence` list based on certain conditions. If `number` is 0, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the size of the sequence, populates the `sequence` list with integers from 0 to 4, and recursively calls itself. Finally, it returns the sum of the calculated `size` and `result`, where `result` is determined by the recursive call and the modifications made to the `sequence` list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences. Specifically, the function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence, but it does not ensure that the resulting array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. 

For example, consider the case where `X = 37`. The program attempts to generate a sequence using bitwise operations, but it does not guarantee that the resulting array will have the exact number of increasing subsequences specified by `X`. The logic in `func_1` is flawed and does not correctly map the input `X` to a valid sequence length and values.

A correct approach would involve generating a sequence where the number of increasing subsequences can be precisely controlled, such as using a sequence of repeated elements with gaps to achieve the desired count. The current implementation does not handle this requirement correctly.
