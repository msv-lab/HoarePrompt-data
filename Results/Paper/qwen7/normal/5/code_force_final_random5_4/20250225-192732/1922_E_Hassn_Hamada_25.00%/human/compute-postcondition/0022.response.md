Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `size`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to 4.
   - `size` is initially set to 5.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will run as long as `i` is less than `size`. Given that `i` starts at 4 and `size` is 5, the loop will execute once (when `i` is 4).

4. **Check if the loop can execute based on the initial state**:
   - The loop will execute because `i` (initially 4) is less than `size` (which is 5).
   - No adjustments are needed for `i` or `size` since they are correctly set for the loop to execute.

5. **Consider other variables**:
   - `number`: It is defined as `sequence[-1] + (1 << size) - 1`. This value is not directly relevant to the loop execution but might be used inside the loop.
   - `result`: It is the return value of `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`. This value is also not directly relevant to the loop execution but might be used outside the loop.

Since the loop can execute based on the given initial values of `i` and `size`, no adjustments are necessary for these variables.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 4, `size` is 5**
