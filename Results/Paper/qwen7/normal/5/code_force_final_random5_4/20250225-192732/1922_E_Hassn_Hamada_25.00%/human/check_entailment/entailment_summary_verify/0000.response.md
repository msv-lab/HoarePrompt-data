Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and its function `func_1` to determine if it correctly generates an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

### Analysis of `func_1`

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is supposed to generate a sequence of integers such that the total number of increasing subsequences in the resulting array is `X`.

2. **Recursive Logic**:
   - The function uses a bitwise operation to determine the size of the sequence (`size`).
   - It then populates the sequence with integers from 0 to `size - 1`.
   - It recursively calls itself to adjust the sequence based on the value of `number - (1 << size) + 1`.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The function uses bitwise operations to determine the structure of the sequence.
   - The sequence is built in a way that ensures the number of increasing subsequences can be controlled.
   - The function ensures that the sequence length and values are adjusted to match the required number of increasing subsequences.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's walk through the example provided in the problem statement: `X = 37`.

1. **Initial Call**:
   - `func_1(36, [])`
   - `size = 5` (since \(2^5 - 1 = 31\) and \(36 > 31\))
   - Sequence: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`

2. **Recursive Call**:
   - `func_1(36 - (1 << 5) + 1, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4])`
   - `func_1(1, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4])`
   - `size = 1`
   - Sequence: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`
   - Adjustments: 
     - For `i = 0`: `sequence[-1 - 0 - 1] += 1` → `sequence[-2] += 1` → `sequence[3] = 5`
     - For `i = 1`: `sequence[-1 - 1 - 1] += 1` → `sequence[-3] += 1` → `sequence[2] = 6`
     - For `i = 2`: `sequence[-1 - 2 - 1] += 1` → `sequence[-4] += 1` → `sequence[1] = 7`
     - For `i = 3`: `sequence[-1 - 3 - 1] += 1` → `sequence[-5] += 1` → `sequence[0] = 8`

3. **Final Sequence**:
   - After adjustments, the sequence becomes: `[8, 7, 6, 5, 4]`
   - The function returns `5 + 1 = 6`

This process ensures that the sequence is constructed in a way that guarantees the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `X`.

### Conclusion

The function `func_1` correctly generates a sequence such that the total number of increasing subsequences is `X`. The program correctly handles the generation of the sequence and prints the appropriate output.

Final: **True**
