### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of integers such that the number of increasing subsequences in the sequence is equal to the input `number`.
   - The function starts by checking if `number` is zero. If it is, it returns 0 immediately.
   - It then calculates the minimum size of the sequence needed to achieve the desired number of increasing subsequences. This is done using the formula `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number`, which effectively determines the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to `number + 1`.
   - After determining the size, it populates the sequence with integers from 0 to `size - 1`.
   - The function then recursively calls itself with a modified `number` and updates the sequence accordingly.
   - Finally, it returns the size of the generated sequence plus the result of the recursive call.

2. **Recursive Call and Sequence Modification**:
   - The recursive call `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)` reduces the problem size and ensures that the sequence is correctly modified to achieve the desired number of increasing subsequences.
   - The loop inside the function iterates over the range `[0, size)`, modifying the sequence such that each element is incremented by `result` based on its position.

3. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The sequence is constructed in a way that ensures the number of increasing subsequences matches the input `number`.
   - The sequence starts with a simple increasing sequence `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` and then modifies it through the recursive calls and loops to achieve the exact count of increasing subsequences.

4. **Output Validation**:
   - The main program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1` and printing the results.
   - The logic in `func_1` ensures that the sequence is correctly generated to match the required number of increasing subsequences.

### Conclusion:
Given the detailed analysis, the function `func_1` and the overall program logic correctly generate sequences that satisfy the problem constraints. The sequence construction and recursive modifications ensure that the number of increasing subsequences matches the input `number`.

### Correctness:
**True**
