### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences, `X`. The solution provided uses a recursive function to construct the array.

2. **Recursive Function Analysis (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence that results in a specific number of increasing subsequences.
   - It uses a binary representation approach to construct the sequence.
   - The function aims to build a sequence where the number of increasing subsequences matches the input `number`.

3. **Base Case**:
   - When `number == 0`, the function returns `0`, indicating an empty sequence.

4. **Recursive Case**:
   - The function calculates the size of the sequence needed to achieve the target number of increasing subsequences.
   - It appends values to the sequence in a way that ensures the desired number of increasing subsequences.
   - The function recursively constructs the sequence and adjusts values to ensure the correct count of increasing subsequences.

5. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The sequence is built by appending values from `0` to `size-1`.
   - The function then recursively constructs the rest of the sequence and adjusts values to match the required count.

6. **Output Handling**:
   - The main loop reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` to generate the sequence and prints the length and the sequence.

### Verification:

- The logic in `func_1` seems correct for constructing sequences that yield the desired number of increasing subsequences.
- The base case and recursive steps are well-defined.
- The adjustments made within the recursive function ensure that the sequence meets the requirements.

### Conclusion:

The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic to generate an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
