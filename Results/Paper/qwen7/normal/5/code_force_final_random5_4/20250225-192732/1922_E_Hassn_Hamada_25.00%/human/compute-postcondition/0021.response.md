Output State: **`number` is `sequence[-1] + (1 << size) - 1`, `i` is 4, `size` is 5, and `result` is the return value of `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`**.

Explanation: 
- The value of `size` is 5, which means the calculation `(1 << size)` results in \(2^5 = 32\).
- The value of `sequence[-1]` is 4, as `sequence` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
- Therefore, `number` is calculated as `sequence[-1] + (1 << size) - 1`, which is `4 + 32 - 1 = 35`.
- The function `func_1` is called with arguments `35` and `sequence`. The return value of this function call is stored in `result`.
- The variables `i` and `size` retain their values from the initial state, as they are not directly modified by the given code snippet.
