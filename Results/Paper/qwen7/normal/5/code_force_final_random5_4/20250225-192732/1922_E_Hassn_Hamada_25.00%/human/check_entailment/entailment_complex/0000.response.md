### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of integers such that the number of increasing subsequences matches a given number `n`.
   - The function starts by checking if `number` is 0. If so, it returns 0.
   - It then calculates the minimum size of the sequence needed to achieve at least `number` increasing subsequences. This is done using the formula `(1 << size + 1) - 1`, which represents the maximum number of increasing subsequences possible with a sequence of a given size.
   - Once the size is determined, the function populates the sequence with integers from 0 to `size - 1`.
   - The function then recursively calls itself with the updated `number` and modifies the sequence based on the result of the recursive call.
   - Finally, it returns the size of the sequence plus the result of the recursive call.

2. **Recursive Call and Sequence Modification**:
   - The recursive call `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)` reduces the `number` by the maximum number of increasing subsequences possible with the current size.
   - The sequence is modified by incrementing specific elements based on the result of the recursive call and the current index `i`.

3. **Output Validation**:
   - The main program prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself.
   - The logic in the `func_1` function ensures that the sequence generated will have the exact number of increasing subsequences as required by the input `n`.

### Example Verification:
- For `n = 2`, the function should return a sequence of length 1, which is `[0]`.
- For `n = 5`, the function should return a sequence of length 3, which is `[0, 1, 0]`.
- For `n = 13`, the function should return a sequence of length 5, which is `[2, 2, 3, 4, 2]`.
- For `n = 37`, the function should return a sequence of length 7, which is `[-1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, -1]`.

Given the logic and the provided examples, the function `func_1` correctly generates sequences that meet the requirements.

The program is designed to solve the problem correctly based on the given constraints and examples.
