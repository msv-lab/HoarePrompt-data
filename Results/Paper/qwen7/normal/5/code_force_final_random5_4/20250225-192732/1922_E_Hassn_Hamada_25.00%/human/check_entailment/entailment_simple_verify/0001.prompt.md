You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to increment `size` as long as `(1 << size + 1) - 1` is less than or equal to `number`. After each iteration, `size` increases by 1. Starting from `size = 1`, the condition will hold true until `size = 5`, where `(1 << 5 + 1) - 1 = 63` would break the condition if `number` is 31 or less. Therefore, after all iterations, `size` will be 5, and `number` must be at least 31 for the loop to have completed all its iterations.

    #State: Output State: `sequence` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, `i` is `4`, and `size` is `5`.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `size` reaches 5, meaning the loop runs 5 times. In each iteration, `i` increments by 1 starting from 0, so after 5 iterations, `i` will be 4. During these iterations, `sequence` is populated with integers from 0 to 4, resulting in `sequence` being `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.

    #State: Output State: `i` is 7, `size` is 5, the element at index `-result - i - 1` in `sequence` is incremented by `result`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs from `i` starting at 4 up to `size` which is 5. Therefore, the loop will run 6 times in total (from 4 to 9 inclusive). After 3 iterations, `i` is 5. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, after all 6 iterations, `i` will be 7. The condition inside the loop modifies the `sequence` array based on the current value of `i` and `result`. Given that the modification happens in every iteration and the loop runs 6 times, the final value of `i` will be 7, and the specified element in `sequence` will be incremented by `result` 6 times.
    return size + result
    #The program returns 11, where `result` is 6 and `size` is 5.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences, `X`. The solution provided uses a recursive function to construct the array.

2. **Recursive Function Analysis (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence that results in a specific number of increasing subsequences.
   - It uses a binary representation approach to construct the sequence.
   - The function aims to build a sequence where the number of increasing subsequences matches the input `number`.

3. **Base Case**:
   - When `number == 0`, the function returns `0`, indicating an empty sequence.

4. **Recursive Case**:
   - The function calculates the size of the sequence needed to achieve the target number of increasing subsequences.
   - It appends values to the sequence in a way that ensures the desired number of increasing subsequences.
   - The function recursively constructs the sequence and adjusts values to ensure the correct count of increasing subsequences.

5. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The sequence is built by appending values from `0` to `size-1`.
   - The function then recursively constructs the rest of the sequence and adjusts values to match the required count.

6. **Output Handling**:
   - The main loop reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` to generate the sequence and prints the length and the sequence.

### Verification:

- The logic in `func_1` seems correct for constructing sequences that yield the desired number of increasing subsequences.
- The base case and recursive steps are well-defined.
- The adjustments made within the recursive function ensure that the sequence meets the requirements.

### Conclusion:

The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic to generate an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
