Output State: **The dictionary `cnt` contains the frequency of each integer present in the list `a`, and the variable `ans` is the sum of each count in `cnt` divided by 3 after all iterations of the loop.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the dictionary `cnt` will have the frequency of each integer in the list `a`. The variable `ans` will be the sum of these frequencies divided by 3, after processing all elements in `cnt.values()`.
