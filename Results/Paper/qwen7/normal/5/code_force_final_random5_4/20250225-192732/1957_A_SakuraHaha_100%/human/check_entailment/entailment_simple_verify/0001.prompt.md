You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the following list contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: Output State: The list `a` is a list of `n` integers each between 1 and 100. The dictionary `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and its value is the count of that integer in the list `a`, with each integer's count updated based on its occurrence in the list `a` after all iterations of the loop.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the dictionary `cnt` will contain the frequency of each integer present in the list `a`.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
        
    #State: The dictionary `cnt` contains the frequency of each integer present in the list `a`, and the variable `ans` is the sum of each count in `cnt` divided by 3 after all iterations of the loop.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of the values in the dictionary cnt divided by 3)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed using the given sticks.
2. A regular polygon must have all sides of equal length, so the key is to count how many sets of three sticks of the same length we can form.
3. The provided program reads the number of test cases but only processes the first test case due to the function `func_1()` not being called correctly within the loop.
4. The function `func_1()` correctly counts the occurrences of each stick length and calculates the number of complete triangles (which correspond to one triangle, one square, etc.) that can be formed.
5. However, the program should process all test cases, not just the first one. The current implementation only handles one test case and does not read or process additional test cases.

Given these points, the program is incorrect because it does not handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
