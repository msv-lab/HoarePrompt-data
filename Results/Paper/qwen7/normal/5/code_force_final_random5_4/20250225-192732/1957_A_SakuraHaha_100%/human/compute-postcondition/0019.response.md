Based on the initial state provided:

- The dictionary `cnt` contains the frequency of each integer present in the list `a`.
- The variable `ans` is the sum of each count in `cnt` divided by 3 after all iterations of the loop.

To determine what will be printed, let's break down the process:

1. **Dictionary `cnt`:** This dictionary holds the frequency of each integer in the list `a`. For example, if `a = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3]`, then `cnt` would be `{1: 2, 2: 3, 3: 4}`.

2. **Variable `ans`:** `ans` is calculated as the sum of all values in `cnt` divided by 3. In the example above, `ans` would be `(2 + 3 + 4) / 3 = 3.666...`.

Since the exact list `a` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we know that `ans` is the sum of the values in `cnt` divided by 3.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the values in the dictionary cnt divided by 3)**
