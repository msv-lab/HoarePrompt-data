Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and we read `n` integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer `n` from the input, which is assigned to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the program now expects to read `n` integers as a list. The initial state of `t` and the precondition that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100 is still valid.
