Output State: The list `a` is a list of `n` integers each between 1 and 100. The dictionary `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and its value is the count of that integer in the list `a`, with each integer's count updated based on its occurrence in the list `a` after all iterations of the loop.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the dictionary `cnt` will contain the frequency of each integer present in the list `a`.
