Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers each between 1 and 100, where `n` is at least 1; `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and its value is the count of that integer in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The line `cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1` updates the dictionary `cnt` by incrementing the count of the integer `x` (which is an element from the list `a`) by 1. If `x` is not already a key in `cnt`, `get(x, 0)` returns 0, and then 1 is added to it, initializing the count for `x`. The length of the list `a` and the range of its elements remain unchanged.
