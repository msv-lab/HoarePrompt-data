### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Reading Test Case Data**: For each test case, the program reads the number of sticks (`n`) and the lengths of the sticks (`a`). This is done correctly using `int(input())` and `list(map(int, input().split()))`.

3. **Counting Stick Frequencies**: The program uses a dictionary `cnt` to count the frequency of each stick length. This is implemented correctly using `cnt.get(x, 0) + 1`.

4. **Calculating Maximum Polygons**: The program calculates the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed. It does this by summing up the counts of each stick length and dividing by 3 (since each polygon has 3 sides). This logic is also correct.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which is the correct approach.

Given the provided code matches the problem description and the steps outlined above, the program appears to be correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
