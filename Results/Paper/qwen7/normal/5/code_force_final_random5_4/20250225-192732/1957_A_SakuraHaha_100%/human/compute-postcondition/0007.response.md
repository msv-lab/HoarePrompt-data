Output State: **`a` is a list of `n-1` integers each between 1 and 100, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and its value is the count of that integer in the list `a`, with the count of the integer `x` increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the count of the integer `x` in the dictionary `cnt`. The value of `cnt[x]` is set to the current count of `x` (retrieved using `cnt.get(x, 0)`) plus 1. All other elements in the list `a` and the dictionary `cnt` remain unchanged.
