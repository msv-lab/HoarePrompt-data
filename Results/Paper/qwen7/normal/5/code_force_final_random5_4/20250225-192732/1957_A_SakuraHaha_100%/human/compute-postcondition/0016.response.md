Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is the `for x in cnt.values():` statement. The only variable that changes within this loop is `x`, which iterates over the values of the dictionary `cnt`.

2. **Understand the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `ans` is increased by the next value of `x // 3` where `x` is one of the remaining keys in `cnt.values()`.
   - `ans` is now equal to its previous value plus `x // 3`.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `x`**:
   - Since `x` is iterating over the values of `cnt`, the next value of `x` will be the next key in `cnt.values()`.
   - The state at the end of the previous iteration means that `x` has already been used to update `ans` once.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - The value of `ans` will be updated again by the next value of `x // 3`.
   - The value of `x` will be the next key in `cnt.values()`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated `ans` and the next value of `x`.

**State:**
- `ans` is now equal to its previous value plus the previous value of `x // 3`.
- `x` will be the next value in `cnt.values()`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`ans` is now equal to its previous value plus the previous value of `x // 3`, `x` will be the next value in `cnt.values()`**.
