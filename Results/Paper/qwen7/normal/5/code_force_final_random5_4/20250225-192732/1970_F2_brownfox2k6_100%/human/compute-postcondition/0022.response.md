Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Description:**
   - `out` is a non-empty list.
   - The first element of `out` (`out[0]`) is the second element of the original `out` (`out[1]`).

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(t, p, 'ELIMINATED')`.

3. **Identifying Variables:**
   - `t` is not defined in the initial state, so it cannot be determined from the given information.
   - `p` is defined as the first element of the updated `out` list, i.e., `p = out[0]`.

4. **Determine Values:**
   - Since `out` is a non-empty list and the first element of `out` is the second element of the original `out`, we know that `p = out[1]` (the second element of the original `out`).
   - `t` is not defined, so it remains as `t`.

Given this analysis, the print statement will output `t`, `p`, and the string `'ELIMINATED'`.

Output: **t, out[1], 'ELIMINATED'**
