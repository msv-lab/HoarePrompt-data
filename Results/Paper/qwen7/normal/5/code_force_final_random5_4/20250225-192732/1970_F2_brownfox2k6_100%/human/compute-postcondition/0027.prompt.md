You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the current time step in the game. player is a dictionary mapping player identifiers (e.g., 'R0', 'B0') to their current positions (a list of two integers [x, y]). blud is a list of positions (a list of two integers [x, y]) representing the current positions of the Bludgers on the field.
def func_2(t):
    out = []
    for p in player:
        if player[p] == blud:
            out.append(p)
            player[p] = [-1, -1]
        
    #State: The list `out` contains all player identifiers `p` for which `player[p]` was equal to `blud` at any point during the loop's execution. The variable `t` remains an integer. The dictionary `player` no longer contains any keys whose value was `blud` before being set to `[-1, -1]`.
    for p in sorted(out):
        print(t, p, 'ELIMINATED')
        
    #State: The loop will continue to execute until `out` is empty. During each iteration, the smallest element in `out` (which is not yet eliminated) is processed. After all iterations, `out` will be empty, and `t` will be incremented for each player in `out`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the current time step in the game, a dictionary `player` mapping player identifiers to their current positions, and a list `blud` of Bludger positions. Based on these inputs, the function determines the state or behavior related to the game at time step `t`, involving players and Bludgers.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
