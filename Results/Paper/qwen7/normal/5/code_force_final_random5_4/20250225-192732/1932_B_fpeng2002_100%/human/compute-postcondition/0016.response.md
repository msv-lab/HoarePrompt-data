Output State: **`num_tests` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `start_year` is the final value calculated after iterating through all elements in `nums` using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each `x` in the range of `len(nums)`**.

Explanation: The variable `num_tests` is decremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 0. The values of `n`, `nums`, and `start_year` remain unchanged from their initial states.
