Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 and reduced by 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is updated to a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `x` is equal to the length of `nums`, `start_year` is 0.**

Explanation: The code sets `start_year` to 0. This initializes `start_year` without changing its value from the previous state. All other variables (`num_tests`, `n`, `nums`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
