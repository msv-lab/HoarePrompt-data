Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `num_tests` is an input integer, and the value of `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
Code of the loop:
while num_tests > 0:
    num_tests -= 1
    n = int(input())
    nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    start_year = 0
    for x in range(0, len(nums)):
        start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
    print(start_year)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `num_tests` is greater than -1 but less than or equal to 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `start_year` is the final value calculated after iterating through all elements in `nums` using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each `x` in the range of `len(nums)`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `start_year` will be the result of applying the given formula to each element in the `nums` list sequentially, starting from the first element and updating `start_year` accordingly until all elements have been processed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Output State: `num_tests` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is equal to the length of `nums`, `start_year` is the result of applying the formula `(start_year // nums[i] + 1) * nums[i]` for each `i` in the range from 0 to the length of `nums` - 1.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `start_year` will be the final value obtained by successively applying the operation `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` to each element in the `nums` list, starting from an initial `start_year` of 0 and iterating over all elements in the list. The other variables (`num_tests` and `n`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Output State: `x` is equal to the length of `nums`; `start_year` is the result of applying the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each `x` from 0 to the length of `nums` minus one, iteratively.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `x` will be equal to the length of the `nums` list, and `start_year` will be the final value obtained by repeatedly updating it according to the given formula for each element in the `nums` list.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
