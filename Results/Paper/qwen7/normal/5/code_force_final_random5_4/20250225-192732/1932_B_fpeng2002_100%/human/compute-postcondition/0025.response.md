Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for x in range(0, len(nums)):`. The variables involved here are `x` and `len(nums)`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `num_tests` is 0
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element
   - `x` is 1
   - `start_year` is `(start_year // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]` and it is also updated to `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`

3. **Determine the Next Value of `x`**:
   - The loop starts with `x = 0` and increments `x` by 1 in each iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is 1.
   - For the next iteration, `x` will be incremented to 2.

4. **Update the State of `start_year`**:
   - Initially, `start_year` is set to `(start_year // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]`.
   - In the next iteration, `start_year` will be updated to `(start_year // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2]`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `x` will be 2.
   - `start_year` will be updated to `(start_year // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2]`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `x` and `start_year`.

**Final State**:
- `num_tests` remains 0.
- `n` remains an input integer.
- `nums` remains a list of integers that must have at least one element.
- `x` is now 2.
- `start_year` is updated to `(start_year // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2]`.

So, the final state is:
State: **`num_tests` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is 2, `start_year` is updated to `(start_year // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2]**.
