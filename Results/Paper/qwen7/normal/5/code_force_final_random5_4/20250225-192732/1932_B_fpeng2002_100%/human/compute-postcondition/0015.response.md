Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `num_tests > 0`.
2. **Current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `num_tests` is greater than -1 but less than or equal to 0. This means `num_tests` could be 0 or a positive number (but not negative).

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `num_tests` must be greater than 0. Since the current state indicates `num_tests` is greater than -1 but less than or equal to 0, the only way to satisfy the loop condition is to set `num_tests` to a positive value.

3. **Adjust the state**: We need to adjust `num_tests` to a value greater than 0. The simplest way to do this is to set `num_tests` to 1 (since it is the smallest positive integer).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`num_tests` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `start_year` is the final value calculated after iterating through all elements in `nums` using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each `x` in the range of `len(nums)`**.
