You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    password = input().strip()
    print(func_1(n, password))

def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    password = input().strip()
    print(func_1(n, password))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and password is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
        
    #State: The `letters` list contains all characters from the `password` string that are not digits, and the `digits` list contains all characters from the `password` string that are digits.
    if (letters != sorted(letters)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: The `letters` list contains all characters from the `password` string that are not digits, and the `digits` list contains all characters from the `password` string that are digits. The `letters` list is not sorted.
    if (digits != sorted(digits)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: The `letters` list contains all characters from the `password` string that are not digits, and the `digits` list contains all characters from the `password` string that are digits. The `letters` list is not sorted, and the `digits` list is sorted.
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: Output State: The variable `i` is equal to `len(password) - 1`, and neither the `return` statement within the loop has been executed, meaning no 'NO' has been returned. All characters in the `letters` list are unsorted as they were initially, and all characters in the `digits` list remain sorted as they were initially. The `password` string has been fully iterated over without any condition inside the loop being met to return 'NO'.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop, the function has gone through each possible pair of adjacent characters in the `password` string (from the first character to the second last character), checking if the current character is alphabetic and the next character is a digit. Since the function did not encounter such a pair, it means that no alphabetic character was followed immediately by a digit in the `password` string.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password itself.
3. The function `func_1` is defined to check if the password meets the criteria:
   - It separates the characters into two lists: `letters` and `digits`.
   - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It iterates through the password to ensure that no digit comes after a letter.
4. If any of these conditions fail, the function returns 'NO'. Otherwise, it returns 'YES'.
5. The logic in the function correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description.

Given this analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.
