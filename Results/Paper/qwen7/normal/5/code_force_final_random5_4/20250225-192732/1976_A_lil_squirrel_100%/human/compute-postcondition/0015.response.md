Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for ch in password:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `ch` (the current character being processed) and `password` (the string being iterated over).

2. **Understand the Loop Body Impact**: Based on the postcondition given, if the latest character `ch` is a digit, it is added to the `digits` list; otherwise, `ch` is added to the `letters` list.

3. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - **`password`**: The `password` string remains unchanged within the loop. Therefore, the value of `password` does not change.
   - **`ch`**: The variable `ch` represents the current character being processed in the loop. After processing each character, `ch` will be the next character in the `password` string.
   - **`letters` and `digits`**: These lists are updated based on the current character `ch`. Since we are looking at the state before the next iteration, these lists will retain their values from the previous iteration.

Given that the `password` string does not change and `ch` will be the next character in the `password` string, we can conclude the following:

- `password` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `ch` will be the next character in the `password` string.
- `letters` and `digits` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`password` is a non-empty string of length \(n\), `letters` is a list containing all characters from `password` that are not digits, and `digits` is a list containing all characters from `password` that are digits, and `ch` is the next character in the `password` string**.
