Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for ch in password:`. The objects involved here are `ch` (the character being iterated over) and `password` (the string being iterated through).

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `letters` is an empty list.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\).
   - `password` is a string of length \(n\) consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
   - `digits` is an empty list.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each character in the `password` string. For the loop to execute, `password` must contain at least one character.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each character in `password`, `ch` will take on the value of each character in `password` during each iteration.
   - The initial state of `password` must be such that it contains at least one character for the loop to execute.

Given the above points, the state that needs to be adjusted is the state of `password`. Specifically, `password` must be a non-empty string of length \(n\) (where \(1 \leq n \leq 20\)).

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

**State: **`password` is a non-empty string of length \(n\) (where \(1 \leq n \leq 20\)), `letters` is an empty list, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\), `digits` is an empty list**.
