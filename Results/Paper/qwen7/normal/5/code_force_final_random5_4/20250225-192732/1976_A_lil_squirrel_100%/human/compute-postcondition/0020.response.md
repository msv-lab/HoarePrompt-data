Output State: **The `letters` list contains all characters from the `password` string that are not digits, and the `digits` list contains all characters from the `password` string that are digits.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `letters` list will contain every character from the original `password` string that is not a digit, while the `digits` list will contain every character from the `password` string that is a digit. The length of both lists combined will be equal to the length of the `password` string, and no other changes will have been made to the initial state of the variables.
