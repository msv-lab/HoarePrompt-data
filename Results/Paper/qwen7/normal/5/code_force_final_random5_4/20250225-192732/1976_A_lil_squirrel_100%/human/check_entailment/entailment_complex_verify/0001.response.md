### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password itself.
   
2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to check if the password meets the criteria:
     - It separates the characters into two lists: `letters` and `digits`.
     - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
     - It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
     - It iterates through the password to ensure that no digit comes after a letter.
   - If any of these conditions fail, the function returns 'NO'. Otherwise, it returns 'YES'.

3. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The function correctly checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - The function correctly checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - The function correctly iterates through the password to ensure that no digit comes after a letter.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles edge cases where the password consists only of letters or only of digits correctly.
   - The function correctly handles the case where the password has both letters and digits.

5. **Annotations:**
   - The annotations provided in the code align with the logic implemented in the function.
   - The state transitions described in the annotations match the behavior of the function.

Given this analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem. The original assessment accurately describes the functionality and logic of the program.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
