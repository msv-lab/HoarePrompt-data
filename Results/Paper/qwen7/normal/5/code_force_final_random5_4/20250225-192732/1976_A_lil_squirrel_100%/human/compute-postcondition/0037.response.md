Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `password`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `len(password) - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `password` is a string with at least one character.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the loop will check if `i < len(password) - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - The condition `i < len(password) - 1` must still hold true for the next iteration.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - The length of `password` does not change, so it remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 2, and `password` is a string with at least one character**.
