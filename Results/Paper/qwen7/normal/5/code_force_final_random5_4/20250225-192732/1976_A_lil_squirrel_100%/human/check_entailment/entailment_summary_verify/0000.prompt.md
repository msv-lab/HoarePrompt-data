You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    password = input().strip()
    print(func_1(n, password))

def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), and `password`, a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. It checks if the `password` string meets certain conditions. If any of the following conditions are true, it returns 'NO':
1. The list of letters in the password is not sorted alphabetically.
2. The list of digits in the password is not sorted numerically.
3. There is at least one occurrence where an alphabetic character is immediately followed by a digit.
If none of these conditions are met, it returns 'YES'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly verifies whether a password meets the specified conditions. Here’s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Letters Sorted in Non-Decreasing Order**: The program collects all letters into `letters` and checks if they are sorted using `sorted(letters)`. This ensures that all letters are in the correct order.

2. **Digits Sorted in Non-Decreasing Order**: Similarly, the program collects all digits into `digits` and checks if they are sorted using `sorted(digits)`. This ensures that all digits are in the correct order.

3. **No Digit After Letter**: The program iterates through the password and checks if a digit follows a letter. If such a sequence is found, it immediately returns "NO".

4. **Only Lowercase Latin Letters and Digits**: The program inherently handles this condition by segregating letters and digits and not performing additional checks for this requirement.

Given these checks, the program correctly identifies whether a password is strong according to the problem description. There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where the program would fail to meet the requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
