Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where a player throws the Quaffle without catching it first. According to the problem description, a player must catch the Quaffle before throwing it. However, the `func_1` function is called directly when the action is 'T' (throw), without checking if the player is currently carrying the Quaffle. This leads to incorrect behavior when a player attempts to throw the Quaffle without having caught it previously.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5 5
.. R1 .. B1 ..
RG .. .. .. BG
RG R0 .Q B0 BG
RG .. .. .. BG
.. R2 .. B2 ..
13
R0 C .Q
R0 T
```

In this scenario, the red player catches the Quaffle and then attempts to throw it without moving to the same cell as the Quaffle. The program will incorrectly process the 'T' action and update the score, even though the player did not actually carry the Quaffle to a goal.
