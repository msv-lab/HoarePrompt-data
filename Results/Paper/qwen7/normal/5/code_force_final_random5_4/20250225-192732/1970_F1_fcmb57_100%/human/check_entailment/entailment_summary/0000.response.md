Reasoning:
- The program correctly parses the input and initializes the players and goals.
- The `func_1` function is defined to update the position of a player based on the movement direction. However, the function name in the program is `func_1`, but it should be `move_player` for clarity.
- The program handles movements and scoring correctly. It updates the player's position based on the movement direction and checks if the player has scored a goal.
- The program prints the correct messages when a goal is scored and prints the final score at the end.
- The logic for updating the player's position and checking for goals seems to be implemented correctly.

Given the execution summary, the function `func_1` is indeed used to update the player's position, and it works as expected by adding the movement vector to the player's current position.

Correctness: **True**
