Output State: **a is assigned to (x, y), b remains unchanged**.

Explanation: The code `x, y = a` unpacks the tuple `a` into two variables `x` and `y`. Since `a` is a tuple containing the integers representing the dimensions N and M of the field, `x` and `y` will now hold these values individually. The value of `b` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this assignment.
