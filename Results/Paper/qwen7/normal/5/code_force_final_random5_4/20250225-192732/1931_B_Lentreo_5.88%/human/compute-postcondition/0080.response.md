Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer \( t \) and then \( t \) lists of \( n \) non-negative integers. It calculates the sum of all non-zero elements in these lists, each subtracted by its respective last element from the end of the list. If this sum equals zero, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.**
