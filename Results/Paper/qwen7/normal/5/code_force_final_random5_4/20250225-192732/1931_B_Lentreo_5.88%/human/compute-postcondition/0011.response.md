Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `nums` must have at least one element.
- If `i` is not 0, then `curr` is updated to the value of `curr + (i - last)`. If `i` is 0, no change is made to `curr`.

### Loop Head
The loop iterates over each element `i` in `nums`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `nums`.
2. **Determine the Next Iteration Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `nums`.
3. **Update States**:
   - Since `i` is being assigned the next element from `nums`, `i` will be the next element in `nums`.
   - `nums` will be the remaining elements in `nums` after removing the current element.

### Updated State
- `nums` must now have at least one element (since it had at least one before and we removed one element).
- `i` will be the next element in `nums`.

### Final Answer
State: **`nums` must have at least one element, `i` is the next element in `nums`**.
