Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `nums` is an empty list, `i` does not exist because the loop has completed, `curr` is the sum of all non-zero elements in the original `nums` list where each element is subtracted by the corresponding `last` value from the previous iteration.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, since we are iterating over the list `nums` and removing one element per iteration, by the end of the loop, `nums` will be empty. The variable `i` will no longer exist as the loop has completed. The variable `curr` will hold the cumulative result of adding each non-zero element of `nums` to `curr` and then subtracting the `last` value from the previous iteration.
