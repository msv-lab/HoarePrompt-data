Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `nums`.

2. **Understand the postcondition**:
   - `nums` is a list with at least one element (excluding the first element of the previous iteration).
   - `i` is the second element of the original `nums`.
   - `curr` is updated to its previous value plus `i` minus `last` if `i` is not 0. If `i` is 0, `curr` remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the second element of the original `nums`, it means that `i` is the current element being processed in the loop.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be a valid element in `nums`. Therefore, `nums` must still contain at least one element after processing the current `i`.
   - The next element `i` in the loop will be the third element of the original `nums`.

Given the above points, let's adjust the states:

- `nums` must still contain at least one element (excluding the first element of the previous iteration).
- `i` will be the third element of the original `nums`.
- `curr` will be updated based on the new `i` and the previous value of `curr`.

Since the exact values of `curr` and `last` are not provided, we will focus on the elements that change in the loop head.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`nums` is a list with at least one element (excluding the first element of the previous iteration), `i` is the third element of the original `nums`, and `curr` is updated to its previous value plus `i` minus `last` if `i` is not 0. If `i` is 0, `curr` remains unchanged.**
