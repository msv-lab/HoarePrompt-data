Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `curr` will be the sum of all non-zero elements in `nums` minus the last element of `nums` (`last`).**

Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in the list `nums`. For each non-zero element `i`, it updates `curr` by adding `i - last`. Since `last` is the last element of `nums`, and assuming the loop runs through all elements of `nums`, `last` remains constant throughout the loop. Therefore, after all iterations, `curr` will be the cumulative sum of all non-zero elements in `nums` minus the last element of `nums`.
