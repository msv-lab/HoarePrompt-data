Output State: **`curr` is 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `last` is the last element of the list `nums`.**

The code initializes the variable `curr` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `nums`, or `last`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
