You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        kq = 0
        for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
            kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]
        print(kq)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        kq = 0
        
        for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
            kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]
        
        print(kq)
        
    #State: The loop has completed all its iterations. `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, and `kq` is the sum of `a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]` for all iterations from `i=0` to `i=len(a)//2-1`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array \(a\) which is defined as the sum of the differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - To maximize this sum, we should aim to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative ones.
   
2. **Rearranging Elements**:
   - By sorting the array \(a\), we can pair the smallest element with the largest element, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on.
   - This approach ensures that the differences \( (a_{i+1} - a_i) \) are maximized for each pair, leading to the maximum possible beauty.

3. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array \(n\) and the array elements.
   - It sorts the array \(a\).
   - It then calculates the beauty by iterating over the first half of the sorted array and computing the difference between the corresponding elements from the start and end of the sorted array.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - Sorting the array and pairing the smallest with the largest, second smallest with the second largest, etc., ensures that the differences are maximized.
   - The calculation of the beauty using the sorted array pairs correctly computes the required sum of differences.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array.
