Output State: **`ntest` is an input integer, `itest` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers created by mapping int to each input split by space, `kq` is the sum of `a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `len(a) // 2 - 1; n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `a`. The variable `ntest` and `itest` remain unchanged, and `n` remains unchanged as well. The value of `kq` is recalculated based on the new list `a`.
