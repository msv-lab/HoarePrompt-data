Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of values `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all integers `i` from 2 to `n`. This means we need to maximize the sum of differences between consecutive elements.

2. The proposed solution sorts the array `a` in ascending order and then calculates the sum of differences between elements symmetrically from the ends of the list towards the center. Specifically, for each element pair `(a[i], a[len(a)-i-1])` where `i` ranges from 0 to `len(a)//2-1`, it adds the difference `a[len(a)-i-1] - a[i]` to the total sum `kq`.

3. By sorting the array in ascending order, the smallest elements are placed at the beginning, and the largest elements are placed at the end. This ensures that when we take the difference between elements symmetrically from the ends, we get the maximum possible positive differences.

4. The logic of the loop correctly pairs the smallest and largest elements, ensuring that the sum of differences is maximized.

5. The program processes each test case independently, and for each test case, it correctly calculates and prints the maximum beauty of the array.

Given these points, the provided solution is correct and follows the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
