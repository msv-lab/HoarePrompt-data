Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer n and a list of n integers a. It sorts the list a in ascending order and then calculates the sum of differences between elements symmetrically from the ends of the list towards the center. Specifically, for each element pair (a[i], a[len(a)-i-1]) where i ranges from 0 to len(a)//2-1, it adds the difference a[len(a)-i-1] - a[i] to the total sum kq. After processing all test cases, it prints the final value of kq for each case.**
