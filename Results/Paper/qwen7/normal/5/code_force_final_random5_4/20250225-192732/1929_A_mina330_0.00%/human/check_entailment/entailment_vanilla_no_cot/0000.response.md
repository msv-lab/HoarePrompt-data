Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program is flawed because it sorts the array and then calculates the beauty by subtracting pairs of elements from the sorted array, which does not necessarily maximize the beauty of the array.

To maximize the beauty, you should aim to maximize the positive differences between consecutive elements. The correct approach is to sort the array and then pair the smallest element with the largest, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on. This ensures that the sum of differences is maximized.

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(ntest):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        kq = 0
        for i in range(n // 2):
            kq += a[n - i - 1] - a[i]
        if n % 2 == 1:
            kq += a[n // 2]
        print(kq)

func()
```

This corrected program correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array by ensuring that the differences between paired elements are maximized.
