Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is `len(a) // 2 + 1`, `kq` is `kq + 2 * (a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i])`**

Explanation: The code updates `kq` by adding `a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]` to its current value. Since `i` is already defined as `len(a) // 2 + 1`, the term `a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]` is added twice to `kq`. Therefore, `kq` is now `kq + 2 * (a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i])`. The list `a` and the value of `i` remain unchanged.
