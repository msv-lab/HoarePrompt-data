Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1**

Explanation: The function `func_1()` is called, but since no specific changes to variables are made within the function (no variable assignments or modifications are shown), the only precondition that remains valid is that `t` must be greater than or equal to 1. All other variables remain unaffected.
