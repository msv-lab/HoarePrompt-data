Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The logic in `func_1` assumes that each '0' encountered after a sequence of '1's contributes to the cost of shifting that sequence to the end. However, this approach does not account for the optimal way to perform cyclic shifts.

For example, consider the input string "101011":
- The program would incorrectly calculate the cost as follows:
  - First '0' after '11': Cost = 3 (shift "101" to end)
  - Second '0' after '11': Cost = 3 (shift "101" to end again)
  - Third '0' after '11': Cost = 3 (shift "101" to end again)
  - Total cost = 3 + 3 + 3 = 9

However, the optimal solution involves:
1. Choosing the substring [2, 4]: "010" -> "001"
2. Choosing the substring [3, 5]: "011" -> "0011"
3. Total cost = 3 + 3 = 6

This example demonstrates that the program does not correctly compute the minimum cost, hence the correctness is **False**.
