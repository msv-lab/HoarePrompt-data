Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function processes a binary string `s` and calculates the minimum cost to sort the string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
   - It iterates through the string and increments a counter `n` whenever it encounters a '1'. When it encounters a '0' after at least one '1' has been counted, it adds `n + 1` to the total cost `ans`.
   - This logic correctly accounts for the cost of making each segment of '1's come before the '0's, which is necessary to sort the string.
   
2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function handles multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and calls `func_1` to compute the minimum cost.
   - It ensures that the number of test cases `t` is read first, and then processes each test case individually.
   - The state transitions and the final output are consistent with the problem statement and the expected behavior.

3. **Overall Program Flow**:
   - The main function calls `func_2`, which in turn calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The program correctly handles the input and output format specified in the problem statement.
   - The logic implemented in both functions aligns with the problem requirements.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
