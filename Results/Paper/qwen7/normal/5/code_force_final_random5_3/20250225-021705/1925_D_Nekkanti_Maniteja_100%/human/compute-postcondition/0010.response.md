Output State: **`u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `a` is `a` plus `f`, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, `m` is `m_prev`, `u` is updated with the first input integer, `v` is updated with the second input integer, `f` is updated with the third input integer.**

Explanation: The code `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `u`, `v`, and `f` respectively. The values of `a`, `i`, and `m` are not directly affected by this line of code, but their previous states are preserved. Therefore, `a` remains `a` plus `f`, `i` remains `i_prev + 1`, and `m` remains `m_prev`. The values of `u`, `v`, and `f` are updated with the new inputs.
