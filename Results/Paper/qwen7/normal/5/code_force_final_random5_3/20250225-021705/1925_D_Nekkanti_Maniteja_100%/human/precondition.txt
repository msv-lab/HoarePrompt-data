t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ \min \Big(10^5, \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. Additionally, for each pair of friends (a_i, b_i), a_i ≠ b_i, 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9. All pairs of friends are distinct, and the sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
