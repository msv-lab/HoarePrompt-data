You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

    #State: Output State: The final value of `s` is calculated as the sum of `c * i * c * m + c * a` for all iterations from `i = 0` to `i = k-1`, plus additional terms for each subsequent iteration up to `i = k-1`. Specifically, for each iteration from `i = k` to `i = k-1`, the term `c * (i + m) * c * (i + m) * (m - (i - k + 1)) + c * a * m` is added to `s`. Here, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `a` is the cumulative sum of `f` for all edges, `M` is \(10^9 + 7\), and `k` is the total number of iterations of the loop.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `s` accumulates the contributions from each edge `f` and the combinatorial terms based on the number of iterations and the modular multiplicative inverse `c`. The final value of `s` is then taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` which represent the number of children, pairs of friends, and the number of excursions.
   - It initializes `M` as \(10^9 + 7\) and calculates the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children, denoted as `c`.

2. **Calculating the Modular Inverse:**
   - The line `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)` computes the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children under modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - This is necessary because we need to use the inverse in our calculations later.

3. **Summing Friendship Values:**
   - The program initializes `s` and `a` to 0.
   - It then iterates through each of the `m` pairs of friends, reading `u`, `v`, and `f` (where `f` is the friendship value).
   - It adds the friendship value `f` to `a`.

4. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The program then enters a loop for `k` excursions.
   - Inside this loop, it updates `s` using the formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`.
   - Here, `c * i * c * m` seems to be an attempt to calculate the contribution of each excursion to the expected value, but it is not correctly formulated for the problem.
   - The term `c * a` adds the current sum of friendship values to `s`.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the result of `s % M`.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Modular Inverse Calculation:** 
  - The calculation of the modular inverse is correct and necessary for the problem.

- **Friendship Value Sum:**
  - The sum of friendship values `a` is correctly calculated.

- **Expected Value Calculation:**
  - The formula used in the loop `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is incorrect. The expected value of the sum of friendship values should be calculated differently. Specifically, the expected value of the sum of friendship values after `k` excursions for a single pair of friends is `k * (k + 1) / 2`. However, the program incorrectly uses `c * i * c * m` and `c * a`.

- **Final Output:**
  - The output is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is correct.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The formula used in the loop is incorrect. Therefore, the program will not produce the correct results for the given problem.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
