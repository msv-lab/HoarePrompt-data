Output State: **`u` is the first input integer, `v` is the second input integer, `f` is the third input integer, `a` is the cumulative sum of `f` added for each iteration from `i=0` to `i=m-1`, `i` is `m-1`, `k` is `m`, `s` is `s + c * i * c * m + c * a`**.

In natural language: `u` is the first input integer, `v` is the second input integer, `f` is the third input integer, `a` is the cumulative sum of `f` added for each iteration from `i=0` to `i=m-1`, `i` is `m-1`, `k` is `m`, and `s` is updated to `s + c * (m-1) * c * m + c * a`.
