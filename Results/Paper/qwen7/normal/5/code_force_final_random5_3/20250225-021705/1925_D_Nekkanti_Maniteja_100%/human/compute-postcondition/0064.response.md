Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `m`.
2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `k + 2`
   - `m` must be greater than `k + 2`
   - `u` is an input integer (not part of the loop head)
   - `v` is an input integer (not part of the loop head)
   - `f` is an input integer (not part of the loop head)
   - `a` is `a + f` (not part of the loop head)

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `m`.
   - Given that `i` is currently `k + 2`, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `k + 3`.
   - Therefore, `m` must still be greater than `k + 3`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be updated to `k + 3`.
   - `m` must remain greater than `k + 3`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` is now `k + 3`.
   - `m` must be greater than `k + 3`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is `k + 3`, `m` must be greater than `k + 3`**
