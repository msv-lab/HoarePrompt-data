Output State: **`a` is `a + f`, `u` is the first input integer, `v` is the second input integer, `f` is the third input integer, `i` is `m`, `k` is `m`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is updated with `a + f`.**

Explanation: The variable `a` is updated by adding the value of `f` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
