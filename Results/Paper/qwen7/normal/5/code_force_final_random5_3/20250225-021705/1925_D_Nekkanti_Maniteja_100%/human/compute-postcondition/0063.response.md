Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(m)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `k + 2`
   - `m` must be greater than `k + 2`
   - `u` is an input integer (not part of the loop head)
   - `v` is an input integer (not part of the loop head)
   - `f` is an input integer (not part of the loop head)
   - `a` is `a + f` (not part of the loop head)

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `m`.
   - Since `i` was `k + 2` at the end of the previous iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, making it `k + 3`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `k + 3` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `m` must still be greater than `k + 2` for the loop to continue.

4. **Construct the new state**:
   - `i` is now `k + 3`
   - `m` must still be greater than `k + 3` (since `i` needs to be less than `m` for the loop to continue)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `i` is `k + 3`, `m` must be greater than `k + 3`**
