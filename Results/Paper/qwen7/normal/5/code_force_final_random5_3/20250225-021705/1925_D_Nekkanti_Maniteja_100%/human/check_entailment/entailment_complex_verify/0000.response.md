### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the problem and the program step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Restatement:
We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The friendship value of a pair of friends increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion they are chosen. For non-friend pairs, the friendship value remains 0.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve this, we need to consider the probability of choosing each pair and how the friendship value changes over the k excursions. 

1. **Probability of Choosing a Pair:**
   - The probability of choosing any specific pair in one excursion is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\).

2. **Expected Increase in Friendship Value:**
   - For a pair of friends, the friendship value increases by 1 for each excursion they are chosen. The expected number of times a pair is chosen in k excursions is \(k \times \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
   - Therefore, the expected increase in friendship value for a pair of friends is \(k \times \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\).

3. **Total Expected Value:**
   - The total expected value is the sum of the expected increases for all pairs of friends.

#### Correct Implementation:
The program should:
1. Calculate the total number of possible pairs \(\binom{n}{2}\).
2. Calculate the modular multiplicative inverse \(c\) of \(\binom{n}{2}\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
3. For each pair of friends, compute the expected increase in friendship value and add it to the total expected value.
4. Print the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Analysis of Given Program:
1. **Modular Multiplicative Inverse Calculation:**
   - The program correctly calculates the modular multiplicative inverse \(c\) of \(\binom{n}{2}\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Summation of Friendship Values:**
   - The program sums the initial friendship values and multiplies by the modular multiplicative inverse, which is incorrect. This does not account for the expected increase in friendship values over the k excursions.

3. **Incorrect Probability Handling:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the probability of choosing each pair and how the friendship value changes over the k excursions.

#### Example Case Revisited:
Consider the example:
```
1
2 1 1
1 2 10
```
- There are 2 children, 1 pair of friends with a friendship value of 10.
- The teacher goes on 1 excursion.
- The correct expected value should be 10 because the friendship value will definitely increase by 1 during the excursion, making it 11, and the expected value is 11.

However, the program will output 0, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
