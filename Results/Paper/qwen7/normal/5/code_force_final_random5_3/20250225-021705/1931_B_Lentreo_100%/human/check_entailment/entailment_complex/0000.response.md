Reasoning:
The provided solution correctly determines whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operations. Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Mean Calculation**: It calculates the mean value of the water in the containers, which is `total // n`.
   - **Cumulative Difference Check**: It iterates through the list of water amounts and maintains a running sum of the differences between each element and the mean. If at any point this running sum becomes negative, it means it is impossible to redistribute the water to make all containers have the same amount, so it returns 'NO'.
   - **Final Check**: If the loop completes without returning 'NO', it means the running sum never went negative, implying that it is possible to redistribute the water to make all containers have the same amount, so it returns 'YES'.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the function correctly handles all edge cases and follows the required steps to determine the possibility of equalizing the water amounts.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
