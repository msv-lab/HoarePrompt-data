Output State: **`n` is the length of `nums`, `total` is the sum of the elements in `nums`, and the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by `n`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the sum of the elements in `nums` to the variable `total`. The initial state tells us that the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by `n`. After executing the code, `total` holds the sum of the elements in `nums`, and the condition that the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by `n` remains true.
