Reasoning:
The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Mean Calculation**: For each test case, it calculates the mean amount of water per container, which should be `total / n` since the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.
3. **Cumulative Difference Check**: The program iterates through the list of water amounts and keeps track of the cumulative difference between the current amount and the mean. If at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, it means that it's impossible to redistribute the water such that all containers have the same amount. This is because a negative cumulative difference indicates that the total amount of water poured into some containers exceeds the total amount poured out, which would violate the condition of redistributing water from lower-indexed containers to higher-indexed ones only.
4. **Output**: The program correctly outputs 'YES' if it's possible to make all containers have the same amount of water, and 'NO' otherwise.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program should work as expected under the constraints provided.

Correctness: **True**
