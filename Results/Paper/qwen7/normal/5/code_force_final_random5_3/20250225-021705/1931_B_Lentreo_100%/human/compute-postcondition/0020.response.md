Output State: **`i` is 3; `curr` is `nums[0] - mean + nums[2] - mean + nums[3] - mean`**

Explanation: The initial value of `curr` is `nums[0] - mean + nums[2] - mean`. The code snippet updates `curr` by adding `nums[i] - mean` to its current value. Given that `i` is 3, `curr` is updated to `nums[0] - mean + nums[2] - mean + nums[3] - mean`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 3.
