Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    print(func_1(nums))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers representing the amounts of water in each container, where the length of nums is n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and the sum of the elements in nums is divisible by n (1 <= n).
def func_1(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    total = sum(nums)
    if (total % n != 0) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    mean = total // n
    curr = 0
    for i in range(n):
        curr += nums[i] - mean
        
        if curr < 0:
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` is `n`, `curr` is the sum of the differences between each element in `nums` and the mean (`total // n`), and `curr` is greater than or equal to 0.
    #
    #In more detail, `i` will be equal to the length of `nums` (denoted as `n`), because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`. The variable `curr` accumulates the sum of `nums[i] - mean` for each iteration of the loop. If at any point during these iterations, `curr` becomes less than 0, the function would return 'NO' immediately. Since we are considering the state after all iterations, it means that `curr` never became negative, and thus the function would return 'YES' (implied by the absence of a return statement before the end of the loop).
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES', indicating that the sum of the differences between each element in `nums` and the mean (`total // n`) is always greater than or equal to 0 after all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `nums`. It calculates the mean value based on the sum of the elements in `nums` divided by the length of `nums`. It then checks if the cumulative sum of the differences between each element in `nums` and the mean remains non-negative throughout the iteration. If the cumulative sum ever becomes negative, the function returns 'NO'. Otherwise, it returns 'YES', indicating that the sum of the differences between each element in `nums` and the mean is always greater than or equal to 0.
