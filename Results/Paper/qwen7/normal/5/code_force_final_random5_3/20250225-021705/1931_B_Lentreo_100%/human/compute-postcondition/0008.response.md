Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `n` is the length of `nums`.
   - `i` should start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0, we need to set `i` to 0.
   - `n` is already given as the length of `nums`, so no adjustment is needed for `n`.
   - `total`, `mean`, and `curr` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the length of `nums`**
