Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 999 (since the loop runs from 0 to `t-1`), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer. The value of `t` remains unchanged throughout the loop executions, and `i` increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `t-1`. After all iterations, `n` and `k` will have the values from the last input provided during the loop's execution, but their specific values depend on the inputs given during each iteration.
