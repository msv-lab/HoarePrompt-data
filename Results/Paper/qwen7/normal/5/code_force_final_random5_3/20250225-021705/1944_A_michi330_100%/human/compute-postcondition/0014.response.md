Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `n` is the first integer from the input split by space, `k` is the second integer from the input split by space.** 

This postcondition remains the same for both the if and else parts since neither part modifies the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, or `k`. Therefore, the overall postcondition after the if-else block executes is the same as the initial precondition.
