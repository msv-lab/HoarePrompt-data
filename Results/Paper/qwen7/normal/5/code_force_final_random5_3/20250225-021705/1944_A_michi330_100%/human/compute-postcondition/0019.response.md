Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `n` is converted to an integer from the first input, `k` is converted to an integer from the second input. Since both the if and else parts do not change the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k`, the values remain the same as the precondition.**
