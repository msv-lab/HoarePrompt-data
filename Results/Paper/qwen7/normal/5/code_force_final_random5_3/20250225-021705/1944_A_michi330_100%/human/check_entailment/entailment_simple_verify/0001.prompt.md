You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    4 1
    
    5 10
    
    5 3
    
    4 4

Output

    2
    1
    4
    1
    5
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, each test case consists of two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ (n * (n - 1)) / 2.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 999 (since the loop runs from 0 to `t-1`), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer. The value of `t` remains unchanged throughout the loop executions, and `i` increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `t-1`. After all iterations, `n` and `k` will have the values from the last input provided during the loop's execution, but their specific values depend on the inputs given during each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading `n` and `k` for each case.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`.
     - If `k >= n - 1`, it prints `1`. This means that if Dominater can destroy at least `n - 1` bridges, Everule can only visit island 1.
     - Otherwise, it prints `n`, meaning that Everule can visit all `n` islands.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The condition `k >= n - 1` is used to determine if Everule can only visit one island.
   - However, the problem states that Dominater can destroy at most `k` bridges, and the bridges are initially such that every pair of islands is connected.
   - If `k < n - 1`, Everule can still potentially visit more than one island depending on which bridges are destroyed.

4. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - To minimize the number of islands Everule can visit, Dominater should ideally destroy bridges in such a way that isolates as many islands as possible from island 1.
   - If `k < n - 1`, destroying fewer than `n - 1` bridges might not isolate any island completely, so Everule can still visit more than one island.
   - Specifically, if `k < n - 1`, Everule can still visit all islands except those directly connected to island 1 by the remaining bridges.

### Conclusion:
The program incorrectly handles the scenario where `k < n - 1`. When `k < n - 1`, Everule should still be able to visit more than one island, depending on the specific bridges destroyed. Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for minimizing the number of islands Everule can visit.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program needs to handle the case where `k < n - 1` more carefully to ensure that the minimum number of islands Everule can visit is calculated correctly.
