Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `arr` is a list of integers, and for every unique number `num` in `arr`, `frequency_table[num]` will be the minimum value between the count of `num` in `arr` and `k`. If a number appears more than `k` times in `arr`, its count in `frequency_table` will be capped at `k`. All other keys in `frequency_table` will not exist if they were not present in `arr`.

This means that for each number in the original list `arr`, the final value in the `frequency_table` will reflect the maximum occurrence of that number up to `k` times, ensuring no number's count exceeds `k` in the `frequency_table`.
