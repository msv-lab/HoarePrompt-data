Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum number of cards left after performing the specified operations.
2. The given solution correctly handles the case when `k > n` by directly printing `n`.
3. The core logic lies in the `func_1` function, which calculates the frequency of each number but caps it at `k` if it exceeds `k`.
4. After obtaining the frequency table, the program checks if any number's frequency is exactly `k`. If so, it prints `k - 1` because we can reduce `k` cards to `k - 1` cards. Otherwise, it prints `n` because no further reduction is possible.
5. The execution summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1`, ensuring that the frequency of each number is capped at `k`.

Given this analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
