Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `k`. It returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is a unique number from `arr` and the value for each key is the minimum value between the count of that number in `arr` and `k`. If any number appears more than `k` times in `arr`, its count in `frequency_table` will be capped at `k`. All other keys in `frequency_table` will not exist if they were not present in `arr`.**
