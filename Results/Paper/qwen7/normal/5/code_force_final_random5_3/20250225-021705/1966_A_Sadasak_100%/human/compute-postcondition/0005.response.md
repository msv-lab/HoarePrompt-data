Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `frequency_table[num]` is equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `frequency_table[num]` to `k`. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `num` is the first element of `arr` and `frequency_table[num]` was initially greater than `k`, it is now exactly equal to `k`.
