Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `frequency_table[num]` is 1**

Explanation: The code increments the count of `num` in the `frequency_table`. Since `num` is the first element of `arr`, and assuming `frequency_table` is initialized such that `num` does not already exist in it (or its count is 0), the line `frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1` will set `frequency_table[num]` to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
