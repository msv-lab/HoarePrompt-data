Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least one element, `num` is the next element in the list, and `frequency_table[num]` is 3**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `frequency_table[num]` by incrementing it by 1. Given that the initial value of `frequency_table[num]` is 2, after executing the code, its value becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
