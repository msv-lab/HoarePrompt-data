Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in results:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `results`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `results` is a non-empty list.
   - `i` is 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in the `results` list. Since `i` is used as an index, it will iterate over each element in the `results` list.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 0, meaning the first element of `results` was processed.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be set to the next index, which is 1.
   - The `results` list remains the same unless modified within the loop body, but since no modification is mentioned, it stays as a non-empty list.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `results` is still a non-empty list.
   - `i` is now 1 (the next index).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**`results` is a non-empty list, `i` is 1**.
