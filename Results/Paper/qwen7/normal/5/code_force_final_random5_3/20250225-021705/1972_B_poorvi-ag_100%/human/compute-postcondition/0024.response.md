Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string input by the user, `results` is a list containing 'no'**.

The code appends the string `'no'` to the list `results`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` must still be greater than 1, `i` remains 2, `n` remains an input integer, `arr` remains a string input by the user, and `results` now contains the element `'no'`.
