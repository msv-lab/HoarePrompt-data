Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(t)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `t`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `t`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be 0 initially, and `t` must be greater than 0.

3. **Initial state of variables**:
   - `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
   - `results` is an empty list.

4. **Adjusting the state**:
   - Since `t` is the upper limit for the loop, it must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.
   - Initially, `i` should be set to 0 because the loop starts with `i = 0` and increments `i` in each iteration.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**.
