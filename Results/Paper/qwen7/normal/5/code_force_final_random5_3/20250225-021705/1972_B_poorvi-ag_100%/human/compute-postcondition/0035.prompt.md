Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is equal to the total number of inputs provided, `i` is equal to `t-1`, `n` is the last input integer received, `arr` is the last string input by the user, and the `results` list contains 'yes' or 'no' for each input based on whether the count of 'U' in `arr` is odd or even, respectively.
Code of the loop:
for i in results:
    print(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `results` is a non-empty list, `i` is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` and the object `results`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list using the variable `i`. This means that `i` takes on the value of each element in `results` in sequence.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration, `results` is a non-empty list, and `i` is 0. This implies that `i` has taken on the first value from the `results` list during the previous iteration.

4. **Determine the Next Value for `i`**: Since `i` takes on the values from the `results` list in sequence, the next value for `i` will be the second element in the `results` list.

5. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must take on the next value from the `results` list, and `results` should still be a non-empty list (since the loop will stop when `results` becomes empty).

Given these points, we can conclude:

- `i` will now be the second element in the `results` list.
- `results` must remain a non-empty list for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `results` is a non-empty list, `i` is the second element in the `results` list**

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `results` is a non-empty list, `i` is the second element in the `results` list




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
