Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` and the object `results`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list using the variable `i`. This means that `i` takes on the value of each element in `results` in sequence.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration, `results` is a non-empty list, and `i` is 0. This implies that `i` has taken on the first value from the `results` list during the previous iteration.

4. **Determine the Next Value for `i`**: Since `i` takes on the values from the `results` list in sequence, the next value for `i` will be the second element in the `results` list.

5. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must take on the next value from the `results` list, and `results` should still be a non-empty list (since the loop will stop when `results` becomes empty).

Given these points, we can conclude:

- `i` will now be the second element in the `results` list.
- `results` must remain a non-empty list for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `results` is a non-empty list, `i` is the second element in the `results` list**
