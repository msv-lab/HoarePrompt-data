Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` is equal to the total number of inputs provided, `i` is equal to `t-1`, `n` is the last input integer received, `arr` is the last string input by the user, and the `results` list contains 'yes' or 'no' for each input based on whether the count of 'U' in `arr` is odd or even, respectively.**

This means that `t` will hold the total number of iterations the loop ran, which is also the number of inputs provided. The variable `i` will be one less than `t` because it starts from 0. The variables `n` and `arr` will contain the last input integer and string received, respectively. The `results` list will have a length equal to `t`, with each element indicating 'yes' if the count of 'U' in the corresponding `arr` was odd, and 'no' if it was even.
