Output State: `results` is a non-empty list, `i` is the third element in the `results` list.

Natural Language Description: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `results` is a non-empty list containing the boolean values ('yes' or 'no') for each input based on the count of 'U' in the corresponding string being odd or even. The variable `i` is set to the last element in the `results` list, which is the result of the last input processed. The variables `t`, `n`, and `arr` retain their final values from the last input, with `t` being the total number of inputs, `n` being the last integer received, and `arr` being the last string input by the user.
