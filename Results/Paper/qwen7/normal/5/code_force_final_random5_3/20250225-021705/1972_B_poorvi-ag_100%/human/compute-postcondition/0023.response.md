Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string input by the user, `results` is a list containing 'yes'**.

Explanation: The line `results.append('yes')` adds the string `'yes'` to the list `results`. Since `t`, `i`, `n`, and `arr` were unaffected by this line of code, their states remain the same as the initial state.
