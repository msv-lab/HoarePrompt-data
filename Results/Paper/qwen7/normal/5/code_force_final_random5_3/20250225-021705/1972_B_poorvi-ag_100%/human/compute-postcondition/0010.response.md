Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is the string input by the user, and the count of 'U' in `arr` is even; results is a list containing 'no'**.

The code appends the string `'no'` to the list `results`. Since `results` was initially an empty list, after appending `'no'`, it contains only one element, which is `'no'`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
