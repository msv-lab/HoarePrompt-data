Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head:**
   - The loop is iterating over `val_a` which is an element from the list `sec_arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `sub_summ` is `val_a[0] + val_a[0]`.
   - `sec_arr` is a non-empty list with at least one element.
   - `val_a` is the second element in the original `sec_arr`.

3. **Understand the loop condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `sec_arr`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration:**
   - Since `val_a` is being iterated over from `sec_arr`, for the loop to execute one more time, `sec_arr` must still have elements.
   - After the current iteration, `val_a` will be set to the next element in `sec_arr`.
   - `sub_summ` will be updated based on the new value of `val_a`.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- `sub_summ` will be updated based on the next element in `sec_arr`.
- `sec_arr` must still have at least one element for the loop to continue.
- `val_a` will be the next element in `sec_arr`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**`sub_summ` is `val_a[0] + val_a[0]` (where `val_a` is the next element in `sec_arr`), `sec_arr` is a non-empty list with at least one element, `val_a` is the third element in the original `sec_arr`**.

So, the final answer is:

State: **`sub_summ` is `val_a[0] + val_a[0]` (where `val_a` is the next element in `sec_arr`), `sec_arr` is a non-empty list with at least one element, `val_a` is the third element in the original `sec_arr`**.
