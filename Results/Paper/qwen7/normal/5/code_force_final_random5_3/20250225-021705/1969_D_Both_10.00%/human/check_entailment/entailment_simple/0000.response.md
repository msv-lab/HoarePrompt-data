### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly defines three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`.
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - `func_2` reads and processes the input for each test case, including the number of items `n` and the values of `k`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic involves sorting the items based on their `b_i` values (price for Bob).
   - A priority queue (`k_arr`) is used to keep track of the `k` most valuable items for Bob.
   - The program iteratively processes the items, updating the `sub_sum` variable to calculate Alice's profit.
   - The logic handles the scenario where Bob either takes no items for free or takes up to `k` items for free.

3. **Function 3 Analysis:**
   - `func_3` calculates the sum of certain values from the lists passed to it.
   - It sums the first elements of the tuples in `sec_arr` and then adds the sum of `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` for each tuple in `main_ar` if the sum is non-negative.
   - This function is correctly implemented and used in the main logic.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases, such as when `k` is zero or when there are fewer than `k` items.
   - The logic ensures that Alice maximizes her profit and Bob minimizes it.

5. **Overall Correctness:**
   - The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
   - The use of a priority queue and sorting ensures that the optimal solution is found for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to calculate Alice's profit under the given constraints and conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
