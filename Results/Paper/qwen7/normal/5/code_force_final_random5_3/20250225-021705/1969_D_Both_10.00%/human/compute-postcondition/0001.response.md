State: **`sub_summ` is 0, `sec_arr` is a non-empty list, `val_a` is the first element in `sec_arr`**

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `val_a`: This variable will take on the value of each element in `sec_arr` during each iteration of the loop.

2. **Determine Initial Conditions**:
   - For the loop to execute, `sec_arr` must contain at least one element. If `sec_arr` is empty, the loop will not execute at all.
   - The initial value of `val_a` will be the first element in `sec_arr`.

3. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since `sub_summ` is not directly involved in the loop's condition or initialization, it remains as `0`.
   - `sec_arr` must be a non-empty list to ensure the loop can execute at least once.
   - `val_a` should be set to the first element of `sec_arr` to reflect the initial state of the loop.

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
- `sub_summ` is 0 (unchanged)
- `sec_arr` is a non-empty list
- `val_a` is the first element in `sec_arr`

This ensures the loop can execute at least once.
