Functionality: **The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `main_ar`, a list of pairs where each pair consists of two integers representing prices for Alice and Bob; and `sec_arr`, a list of integers. It calculates and returns `sub_summ`, which is the sum of all first elements from the tuples in `sec_arr`. The function iterates over `sec_arr` to sum the first elements of its tuples and then iterates over `main_ar` to add the sum of each pair's elements (if their sum is non-negative) to `sub_summ`.**
