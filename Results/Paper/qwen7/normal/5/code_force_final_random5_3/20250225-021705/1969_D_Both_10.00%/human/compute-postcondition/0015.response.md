Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for val_b in main_ar:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `val_b` and `main_ar`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `main_ar`. 

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `sub_summ` is the sum of all `val_a[0]` values in `sec_arr`.
   - `sec_arr` is a non-empty list.
   - `val_a` is the last tuple in `sec_arr`.
   - `main_ar` must contain at least one element.
   - If `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, then `sub_summ` is updated to include `val_b[0] + val_b[1]`.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `main_ar` must contain at least one element, and the loop continues as long as `main_ar` is not empty, the next iteration will occur if `main_ar` still contains at least one element.
   - After processing one element from `main_ar`, `main_ar` will have one less element.

5. **Update the State**:
   - `sub_summ` remains unchanged unless `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, but since we are only adjusting the state for the next iteration, we don't update `sub_summ` here.
   - `sec_arr` and `val_a` remain unchanged.
   - `main_ar` will have one less element, but it must still contain at least one element for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`sub_summ` is the sum of all `val_a[0]` values in `sec_arr`, `sec_arr` is a non-empty list, `val_a` is the last tuple in `sec_arr`, `main_ar` must contain at least one element (and will have one less element than before)**.
