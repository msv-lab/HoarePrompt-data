Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `sub_summ` will be the sum of all `val_a[0]` values in `sec_arr`, `sec_arr` is a non-empty list, and `val_a` is the last tuple in `sec_arr`.**

In natural language: After the loop has completed all its iterations, `sub_summ` will hold the total sum of the first elements (`val_a[0]`) from all the tuples in `sec_arr`. The list `sec_arr` remains non-empty, and `val_a` will be the last tuple that was processed during the loop's execution.
