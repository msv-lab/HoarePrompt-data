Output State: **`results` is a list containing either ['YES'] or ['NO'], `reachable_first_row` is True, `reachable_second_row` is True, `j` is equal to `n`, and `n` and `(row1, row2)` are assigned from `test_case`.**

Explanation: The code sets `reachable_first_row` to `True`. The other variables (`results`, `reachable_second_row`, `j`, `n`, `row1`, and `row2`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
