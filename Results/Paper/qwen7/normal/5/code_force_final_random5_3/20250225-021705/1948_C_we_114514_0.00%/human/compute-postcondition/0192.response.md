Output State: **`reachable_first_row` is `False`, `j` is `j + 1`, `n` is the first element of `test_case`, `test_case` is updated to the next element in `test_cases`, `row1` is the new second element of `test_case`, `row2` is the new second element of `test_case` with the next row from `test_cases`, `reachable_second_row` is `True`**.

Explanation: The code sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
