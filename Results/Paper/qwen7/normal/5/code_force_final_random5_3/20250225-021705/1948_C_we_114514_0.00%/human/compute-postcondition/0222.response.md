Output State: **reachable_second_row is True, j is equal to n, test_case is empty, row1 is an empty list, row2 is an empty list.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `j` will be equal to `n` because the loop increments `j` until it reaches `n-1` and then sets `j` to `n`. Since the loop continues to check the conditions even after `j` equals `n-1`, it will set `j` to `n`. The variable `reachable_second_row` will be `True` if any of the conditions in the loop body were met, particularly if `row1[j]` was `'> '` and `j` was either `n-1` or if `row2[j]` was `'> '` when `row1[j]` was not `'> '`. All other variables (`n`, `test_case`, `row1`, `row2`) will be reset to their initial states since the loop updates these variables at the start of each iteration, and once `j` reaches `n`, there are no more elements in `test_case` to process, making `test_case` and `row2` empty lists.
