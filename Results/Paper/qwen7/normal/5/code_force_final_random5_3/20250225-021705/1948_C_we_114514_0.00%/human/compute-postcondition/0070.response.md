Output State: **`results` is now ['YES'], `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is True, and the current value of `j` is equal to `n`.**

Explanation: The code `results.append('YES')` adds the string 'YES' to the list `results`. Since `results` was initially an empty list, after appending 'YES', it becomes `['YES']`. The values of `reachable_first_row`, `reachable_second_row`, and `j` remain unchanged from their initial states.
