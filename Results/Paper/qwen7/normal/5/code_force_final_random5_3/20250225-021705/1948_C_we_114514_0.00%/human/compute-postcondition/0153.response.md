Postcondition: **`results` is a list containing either ['YES'] or ['NO'], `reachable_second_row` is True, `reachable_first_row` is False, and `j` is equal to `n`.**

This means that regardless of whether the condition `reachable_second_row` is true or false, the final state of the variables will remain the same: `results` will still be a list containing either ['YES'] or ['NO'], `reachable_second_row` will be True, `reachable_first_row` will be False, and `j` will be equal to `n`.
