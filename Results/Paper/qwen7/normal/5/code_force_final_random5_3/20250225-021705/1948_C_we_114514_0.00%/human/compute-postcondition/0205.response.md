Output State: **`reachable_second_row` is True**.

The code `reachable_second_row = True` simply updates the variable `reachable_second_row` to `True`. There are no other variables affected, and the initial state of `reachable_second_row` being updated based on conditions using `j + 1` instead of `j` is no longer relevant since the new value is explicitly set to `True`.
