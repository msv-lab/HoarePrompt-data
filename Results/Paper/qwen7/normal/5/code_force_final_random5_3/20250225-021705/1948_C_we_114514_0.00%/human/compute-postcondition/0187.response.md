Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `j < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is less than `n`.
   - `n` is the first element of `test_case`.
   - `test_case` is updated to contain the next element in `test_cases`.
   - `row1` is the second element of `test_case`.
   - `row2` is the updated second element of `test_case` with the next row from `test_cases`.
   - `reachable_second_row` is True if `row1[j]` is '>', and either `j` equals `n - 1` or the current value of `row2[j]` is '>', otherwise `reachable_second_row` remains False.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `j` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.
   - `n` remains the same because it is derived from the first element of `test_case`, which does not change within the loop.
   - `test_case` will be updated again to contain the next element in `test_cases`.
   - `row1` will be updated to the new second element of `test_case`.
   - `row2` will be updated to the new second element of `test_case` with the next row from `test_cases`.
   - `reachable_second_row` will be recalculated based on the new values of `row1[j]` and `row2[j]`.

5. **Determine the new state**:
   - `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `test_case` will be updated to the next element in `test_cases`.
   - `row1` will be the new second element of `test_case`.
   - `row2` will be the updated second element of `test_case` with the next row from `test_cases`.
   - `reachable_second_row` will be recalculated based on the new values of `row1[j]` and `row2[j]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: `j` is `j + 1`, `n` is the first element of `test_case`, `test_case` is updated to contain the next element in `test_cases`, `row1` is the second element of `test_case`, `row2` is the updated second element of `test_case` with the next row from `test_cases`, and `reachable_second_row` is recalculated based on the new values of `row1[j]` and `row2[j]`.**
