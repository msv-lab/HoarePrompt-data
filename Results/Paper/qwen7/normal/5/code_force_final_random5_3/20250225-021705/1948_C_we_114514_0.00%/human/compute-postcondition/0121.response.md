Postcondition: `results` is a list containing either ['YES'] or ['NO'], `reachable_second_row` is True, `reachable_first_row` is False, and the value of `row2[j]` remains '>', since the condition `reachable_first_row` is always set to False within the if block and the value of `row2[j]` is not affected by the if condition.
