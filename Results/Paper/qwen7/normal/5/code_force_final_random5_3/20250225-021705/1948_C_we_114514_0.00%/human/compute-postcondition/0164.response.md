Output State: **reachable_second_row is True, `j` is less than `n`, `n` is the first element of `test_case`, `test_case` is updated to contain the next element in `test_cases`, `row1` is the second element of `test_case`, `row2` is the second element of `test_case`, the current value of `row1[j]` is '>', and `reachable_first_row` is true.**

The code simply sets `reachable_second_row` to True, which does not affect any other variables or their relationships. The condition `j == n - 1` remains true, and all other variables retain their previous states.
