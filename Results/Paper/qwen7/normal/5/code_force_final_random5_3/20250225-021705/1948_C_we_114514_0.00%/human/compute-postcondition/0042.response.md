Postcondition: `results` is an empty list, `reachable_second_row` is True, and `reachable_first_row` is either False or remains unchanged (depending on the value of `j`). `j` is less than `n`, and `row2[j]` is greater than '>' unless `j` equals `n` minus 1, in which case `reachable_first_row` remains unchanged and `j` is equal to `n` minus 1.
