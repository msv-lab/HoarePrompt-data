Output State: **`results` is a list containing either ['YES'] or ['NO'], `reachable_first_row` is True, `reachable_second_row` is False, `j` is equal to `n`, and `n` and `(row1, row2)` are assigned from `test_case`.**

The code `reachable_second_row = False` changes the value of `reachable_second_row` to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state.
