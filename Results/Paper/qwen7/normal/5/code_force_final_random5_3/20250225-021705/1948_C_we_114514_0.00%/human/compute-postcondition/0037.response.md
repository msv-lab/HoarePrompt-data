Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` is True, `j` is less than `n`, and `row2[j]` is greater than '>' unless `j` equals `n` minus 1, in which case `reachable_first_row` remains unchanged and `j` is equal to `n` minus 1.**

Explanation: The line `reachable_first_row = False` changes the value of `reachable_first_row` from either True or False to explicitly False. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
