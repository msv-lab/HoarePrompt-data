The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. `test_cases` is a list containing lists, where each inner list has three elements: an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is even), and two strings representing the first and second rows of the grid, where each string consists of exactly n characters that are either '<' or '>' indicating the direction of the arrow in each cell.

The function processes each `test_case` in `test_cases` and returns a list named `results` containing either 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether `reachable_second_row` was True at the end of processing each `test_case`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t` and a list `test_cases`. For each `test_case` in `test_cases`, it processes an integer `n` and two strings representing the first and second rows of a grid. It returns a list `results` containing 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether it was possible to reach the second row from the first row following the directions of the arrows.**
