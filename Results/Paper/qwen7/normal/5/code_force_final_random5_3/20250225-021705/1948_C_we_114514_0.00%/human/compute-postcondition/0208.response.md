Output State: **`reachable_first_row` is False, `j` is `j + 1`.**

Explanation: The initial state mentions that `reachable_first_row` is set to `False`, and `j` is incremented by 1. However, the given code snippet does not provide a specific value for `j` or change its value directly. It only uses `j + 1` in conditions to update `reachable_second_row`. Since no direct assignment or calculation involving `j` is shown, `j` remains as `j + 1` from its initial state. The value of `reachable_first_row` stays unchanged as `False`.
