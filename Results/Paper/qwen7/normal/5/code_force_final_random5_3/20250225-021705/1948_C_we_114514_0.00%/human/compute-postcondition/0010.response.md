Postcondition: `results` is an empty list, `reachable_first_row` is True, `reachable_second_row` is True, `j` is equal to `n` minus 1, and the current value of `row1[j]` is '>'.

This postcondition summarizes that if `j` equals `n - 1`, then `reachable_second_row` becomes True, and the overall postcondition reflects this change along with the other pre-existing conditions. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change if the condition `j == n - 1` is not met.
