You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Example

    >><<><
    
    ><>>><

Output

    YES
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

For each `test_case` in `test_cases`, if `reachable_second_row` is True at the end of the loop execution for that `test_case`, the corresponding element in `results` is 'YES'. Otherwise, it is 'NO'. The variables `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` are reset to their initial states (False and False, respectively) before each new `test_case` is processed. The variable `j` is set to `n` at the end of each iteration through `test_cases`.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `results` will contain one 'YES' for every `test_case` where `reachable_second_row` was True at the end of processing that `test_case`, and 'NO' otherwise.

    #`results` is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether `reachable_second_row` was True at the end of processing each `test_case` in `test_cases`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for determining if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) is flawed. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initial Reachability Check**: The program checks if the robot can move from the first row to the second row using the arrows. However, it only checks if the last character in the first row is `>` and if the second-to-last character in the second row is `>`. This is too restrictive and does not cover all possible valid paths.

2. **Example Counterexample**:
   - Consider the following test case:
     ```
     4
     >><<
     >>><
     ```
   - According to the problem description, the robot starts at (1, 1). It can move right to (1, 2) because the arrow points right (`>`). From (1, 2), it can move down to (2, 2) because the arrow points down (`>`). From (2, 2), it can move right to (2, 3) and then down to (1, 3) and so on. The program incorrectly returns 'NO' for this case because it does not account for the possibility of moving down and then right.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach would involve simulating the robot's movement step-by-step for each test case to ensure it can reach (2, n). The program should check if there is a sequence of moves that allows the robot to reach the target cell.

Since the provided program does not correctly simulate the robot's movement and fails to account for all valid paths, it is incorrect.
