Output State: `results` is a list containing either ['YES'] or ['NO'], `reachable_second_row` is True, `reachable_first_row` is False, and `j` is equal to `n - 1`.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the `results` list will still contain either ['YES'] or ['NO']. The `reachable_second_row` flag will be set to True, indicating that the second row has been made reachable according to the conditions within the loop. The `reachable_first_row` flag will be set to False, meaning the first row was not made reachable. The variable `j` will be equal to `n - 1`, as it increments with each iteration until it reaches `n - 1` and then stops, without changing further even if the condition `j == n - 1` is met inside the loop.
