Postcondition: `results` is a list containing either ['YES'] or ['NO'], `reachable_first_row` is True, `reachable_second_row` is True, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, `n` and `(row1, row2)` are assigned from `test_case`, and `j` is less than `n`. Additionally, `reachable_second_row` remains True, `j` is `n - 1`, and the current value of `row2[j]` is '>', since the if condition `(reachable_second_row)` evaluates to True.
