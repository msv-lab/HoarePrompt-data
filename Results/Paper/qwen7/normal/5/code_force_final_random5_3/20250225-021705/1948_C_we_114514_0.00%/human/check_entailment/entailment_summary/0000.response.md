Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input as specified, including the number of test cases, the size of the grid, and the directions of the arrows in both rows.
2. The function `func_1` iterates through each test case and checks if it's possible to move from the first row to the second row by following the arrows.
3. The logic within the loop seems to check if the robot can move from the first row to the second row by ensuring that the arrows point in a way that allows such a transition.
4. The program correctly handles the constraints and additional conditions mentioned in the problem statement.
5. The final output matches the expected format, printing 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct according to the provided problem description and execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
