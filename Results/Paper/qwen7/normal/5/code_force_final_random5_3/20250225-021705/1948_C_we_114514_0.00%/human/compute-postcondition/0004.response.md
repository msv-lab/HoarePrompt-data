Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `reachable_first_row` is True, `reachable_second_row` is False.**

The code simply assigns `False` to the variable `reachable_second_row`. This does not affect the values of `results`, `test_case`, or `reachable_first_row`. Therefore, the output state retains the values of these variables from the initial state, with only `reachable_second_row` being updated to `False`.
