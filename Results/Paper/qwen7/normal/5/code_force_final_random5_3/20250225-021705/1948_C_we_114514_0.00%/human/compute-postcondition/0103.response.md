Output State: **`reachable_second_row` is True, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, the current value of `row2[j]` is '>'**.

Explanation: The code `reachable_second_row = True` simply updates the value of `reachable_second_row` to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged. Since the initial state specified that `reachable_second_row` was already `True`, updating it again does not change its value. The values of `j`, `n`, and `row2[j]` remain as they were initially.
