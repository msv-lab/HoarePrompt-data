Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `j < n`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is less than `n`.
   - `n` is the first element of `test_case`.
   - `test_case` is updated to contain the next element in `test_cases`.
   - `row1` is the second element of `test_case`.
   - `row2` is the updated second element of `test_case` with the next row from `test_cases`.
   - `reachable_second_row` is True if `row1[j]` is '>', and either `j` equals `n - 1` or the current value of `row2[j]` is '>', otherwise it remains False.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - `j` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.
   - `n` will remain the same because it is derived from the first element of `test_case`, which does not change within the loop.
   - `test_case` will be updated to the next element in `test_cases`.
   - `row1` will be updated to the new second element of `test_case`.
   - `row2` will be updated to the new second element of `test_case` with the next row from `test_cases`.
   - `reachable_second_row` will be recalculated based on the new values of `row1[j]` and `row2[j]`.

5. **Update the States**:
   - `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `test_case` will be updated to the next element in `test_cases`.
   - `row1` will be the new second element of `test_case`.
   - `row2` will be the new second element of `test_case` with the next row from `test_cases`.
   - `reachable_second_row` will be recalculated based on the new values of `row1[j]` and `row2[j]`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are:

- `j` will be `j + 1`.
- `test_case` will be updated to the next element in `test_cases`.
- `row1` will be the new second element of `test_case`.
- `row2` will be the new second element of `test_case` with the next row from `test_cases`.
- `reachable_second_row` will be recalculated based on the new values of `row1[j]` and `row2[j]`.

Therefore, the final state for the next iteration is:

State: **`j` is `j + 1`, `n` is the first element of `test_case`, `test_case` is updated to the next element in `test_cases`, `row1` is the new second element of `test_case`, `row2` is the new second element of `test_case` with the next row from `test_cases`, `reachable_second_row` is recalculated based on the new values of `row1[j]` and `row2[j]`**.
