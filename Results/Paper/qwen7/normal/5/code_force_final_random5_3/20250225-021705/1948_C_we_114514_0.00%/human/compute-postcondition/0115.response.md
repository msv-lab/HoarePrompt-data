Output State: **`results` is a list containing either ['YES'] or ['NO'], `reachable_second_row` is True, `reachable_first_row` is False, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, and the current value of `row2[j]` is '>'**.

Explanation: The code sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the values of `results`, `reachable_first_row`, `j`, and the value of `row2[j]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
