Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 676\), `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `k` is the second integer input by the user, `s` is the string 'aaaaaaaaa', `j` is 105, `n` and `k` are integers assigned the values from the input split by space**.

This means that the values of `t`, `i`, `s`, and `j` remain unchanged, while `n` and `k` are now integers obtained from the user's input, split by a space.
