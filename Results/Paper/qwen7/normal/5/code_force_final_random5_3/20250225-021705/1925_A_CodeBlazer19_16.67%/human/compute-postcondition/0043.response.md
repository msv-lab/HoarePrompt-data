Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `j` in the range `range(97, k + 97)`. This means the loop will iterate over values of `j` starting from 97 up to `k + 97 - 1`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is currently 199.
   - `k` is at least 102.
   - `s` is the character corresponding to the ASCII value 199 (`}*`).

3. **Check if the loop can continue**:
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `k + 97`.
   - Given `j = 199`, we need to check if `199 < k + 97`.

4. **Calculate the condition for the next iteration**:
   - From the inequality `199 < k + 97`, we can solve for `k`:
     \[
     199 < k + 97 \implies k > 102
     \]
   - Since `k` is already stated to be at least 102, the condition `k > 102` is satisfied.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will become `200`.
   - `k` remains at least 102 (no change needed as it is a lower bound).
   - `s` remains the same since it is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`j` is 200, `k` is at least 102, `s` is the character corresponding to the ASCII value 199 (`}*`)***
