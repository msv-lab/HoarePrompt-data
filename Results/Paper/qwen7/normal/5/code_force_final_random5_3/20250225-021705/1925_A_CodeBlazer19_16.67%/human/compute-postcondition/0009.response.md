Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 676\), `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `k` is the second integer input by the user, `s` is the string 'aaa', `j` is 99**

Explanation: The code `s += chr(j)` appends the character represented by the ASCII value of `j` (which is 99, corresponding to the character 'c') to the string `s`. Initially, `s` is 'aa'. After appending 'c', `s` becomes 'aac'. However, since the code does not change the length of the string `s` to exactly three characters, the final string remains 'aaa' as the character 'c' overwrites the last character of 'aa'. All other variables remain unchanged.
