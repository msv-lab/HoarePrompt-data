Output State: **The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `i` ranges from 0 to `t-1`. The variable `j` will end at `97 + t*96`, `k` is at least 102, and `s` is the string consisting of characters from ASCII values 97 to `97 + t*96`.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will have taken on all integer values from 0 to `t-1`. The variable `j` will increment by 96 for each iteration, starting from 97, up to `97 + t*96`. Since `k` was at least 102 in the previous states and remains unchanged, `s` will be a string containing characters from ASCII 97 to `97 + t*96`.
