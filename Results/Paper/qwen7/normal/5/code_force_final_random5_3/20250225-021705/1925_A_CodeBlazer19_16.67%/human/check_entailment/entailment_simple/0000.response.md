### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`.

2. **String Construction**:
   - For each test case, the program constructs a string `s` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - If `k == 1`, the program prints `n * s`, which means it repeats the single character `n` times. This ensures that all possible strings of length `n` using the single character are subsequences.
   - If `k > 1`, the program prints `(2 - (n == 1)) * s`. This ensures that the string `s` is constructed in a way that allows all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` characters to be subsequences. Specifically, it ensures that the string `s` is long enough to accommodate all combinations.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `n == 1` and `k > 1`, the output should be a string of length `k` (e.g., "abc" for `n=1` and `k=3`). The current logic `(2 - (n == 1)) * s` will produce a string of length `k` when `n == 1`.
   - When `n > 1` and `k > 1`, the logic ensures that the string `s` is repeated twice minus one (to avoid redundancy), ensuring all possible strings of length `n` are covered.

4. **Output**:
   - The program correctly outputs the required string for each test case.

5. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates `t` times, processing each test case correctly.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to handle all test cases correctly according to the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases.
