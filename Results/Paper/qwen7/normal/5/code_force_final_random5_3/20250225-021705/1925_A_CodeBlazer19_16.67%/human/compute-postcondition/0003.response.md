Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 676, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `k` is the second integer input by the user, `s` is an empty string.**

The code initializes an empty string `s`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
