Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(97, k + 97)`. The variable `j` is being assigned values from the range starting at 97 up to `k + 97 - 1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `j`**: The problem states that `j` is initially 105.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**: For the loop to execute, the value of `j` must fall within the range specified by the loop head, i.e., `97 <= j < k + 97`.

4. **Adjust the state of `j` and `k`**: Since `j` is initially 105, we need to ensure that `97 <= 105 < k + 97` for the loop to execute. This means `k` must be at least 8 (since `105 < k + 97` implies `k > 105 - 97`, thus `k >= 8`).

5. **Other variables**: The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `s`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` and `k`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`j` is 105, `k` must be at least 8**
