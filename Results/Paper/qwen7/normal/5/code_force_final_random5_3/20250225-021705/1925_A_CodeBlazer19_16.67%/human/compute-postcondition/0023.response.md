Output State: **`j` is 106, `k` must be greater than 9, `s` is a string containing the characters 'i' and 'u'**.

Explanation: The code `s += chr(j)` appends the character with ASCII value 106 to the string `s`. Since `j` is 106, the character appended is 'u'. Initially, `s` contains the character with ASCII value 105, which is 'i'. Therefore, after the operation, `s` becomes 'iu'. The value of `j` remains unchanged, and the condition that `k` must be greater than 9 is still valid.
