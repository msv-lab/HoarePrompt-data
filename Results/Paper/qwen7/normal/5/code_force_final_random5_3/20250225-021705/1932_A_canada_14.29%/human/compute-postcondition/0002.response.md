Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `len` is an input integer; `s` is a list of characters from the input string.**

Explanation: The code `s = list(input())` takes an input string from the user and converts it into a list of characters. The variable `t` and `len` remain unchanged from their initial states.
