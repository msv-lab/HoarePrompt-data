Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `thorn` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `ret` is 0, and `i` is the last character in the list `s` has been converted to a list from user input.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == '@':
        thorn = 0
        ret += 1
    elif i == '*':
        thorn += 1
        if thorn == 2:
            break
    else:
        thorn == 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `thorn` is 1 if `i` is '*', and 0 if `i` is not '*'. `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least one character, `ret` is 0, and `i` is the first character in the list `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `thorn`, `t`, `len`, `s`, `ret`, and `i` retain their original values if `i` is not '@'. If `i` is '@', `thorn` is set to 0. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is set to 2; otherwise, `thorn` is set to 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `thorn` is either 1 or 0, depending on the value of `i`. If `i` is '@', then `thorn` remains 1. If `i` is not '@', then `thorn` is incremented by 1. Additionally, `t`, `len`, `s`, and `ret` retain their original values. If `thorn` equals 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, `thorn` is reset to 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
