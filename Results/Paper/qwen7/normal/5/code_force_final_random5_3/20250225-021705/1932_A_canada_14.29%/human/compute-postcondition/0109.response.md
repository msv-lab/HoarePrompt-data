Output State: **`thorn` is 0, `ret` is 0, `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least one character, and the current value of `i` is '@'.**

Explanation: The code `thorn = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `thorn`. The values of `ret`, `len`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
