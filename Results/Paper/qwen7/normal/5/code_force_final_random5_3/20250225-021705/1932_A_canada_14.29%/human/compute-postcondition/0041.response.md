Postcondition: `thorn` is either 1 or 3, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `ret` is 0, and `i` is the next character in the list `s`. If `thorn` equals 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
