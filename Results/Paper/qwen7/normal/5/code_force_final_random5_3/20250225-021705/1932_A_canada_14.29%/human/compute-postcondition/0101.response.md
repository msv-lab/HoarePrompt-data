Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State Analysis
- `thorn` will be 0 if it was reset to 0 inside the loop (due to encountering '@').
- `thorn` will be 1 if it was incremented to 2 and then reset to 0 due to encountering '*' twice.
- `ret` will be equal to the number of times '@' was encountered during the loop's execution.
- `t`, `len`, `s`, and `i` will retain their original values from the initial state.

### Loop Head Variables
The loop head variables are `_` and the value provided by `range(int(input()))`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for each integer input provided by `range(int(input()))`.
2. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variables in the loop head are `_` and the value generated by `range(int(input()))`.

Since the loop is iterating based on user input, the state of `thorn` and `ret` might change depending on the input. However, the loop itself does not modify `t`, `len`, `s`, or `i`.

### Adjusting States
- **thorn**: Could be either 0 or 1 based on the conditions inside the loop.
- **ret**: Will be incremented by 1 each time '@' is encountered.
- **t**, `len`, `s`, and `i`: These will retain their original values from the initial state.

### New Iteration State
For the loop to execute one more time, the loop condition must be satisfied. Since the loop is controlled by user input, the only thing that changes is the value of the loop counter `_`.

### Final State
- `thorn` could be either 0 or 1.
- `ret` will be incremented by 1 from the previous value.
- `t`, `len`, `s`, and `i` will retain their original values from the initial state.

Given that the loop is controlled by user input, the exact value of the loop counter `_` is unknown but will increment by 1 for the next iteration.

### Conclusion
State: **`thorn` is 0 or 1, `ret` is incremented by 1 from the previous value, `t`, `len`, `s`, and `i` retain their original values from the initial state.**

However, since we need to provide a specific state, we can assume the most general case where `thorn` could be either 0 or 1, and `ret` is incremented by 1.

State: **`thorn` is 0 or 1, `ret` is incremented by 1, `t`, `len`, `s`, and `i` retain their original values from the initial state.**
