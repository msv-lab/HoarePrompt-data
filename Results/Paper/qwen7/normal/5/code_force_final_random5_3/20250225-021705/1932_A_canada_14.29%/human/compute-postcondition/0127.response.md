Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over each character `i` in the list `s`.
   - The relevant variables in the loop head are `i` and `s`.

2. **Understand the Postconditions:**
   - `thorn` is set to 2 if `i` is '*', otherwise it is 0.
   - `ret` is set to 1 if `i` is '@', otherwise it is 0.
   - `len` is an input integer.
   - `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least one character.

3. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over each character in `s`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the next character in the list `s`.
   - The postconditions for `thorn` and `ret` depend on the current value of `i`. However, since these values are determined based on the current `i`, they will change with each iteration.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `len` remains unchanged as it is an input integer.
   - `s` is the same list but with the current `i` being processed.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the next character in the list `s`.

**State:**
- `thorn` and `ret` will be determined by the next character in `s`.
- `len` remains the same.
- `s` remains the same list but with the current `i` being processed.

Since we don't know the exact next character in `s`, we can represent the state as follows:

State: **`thorn` is 2 if the next `i` is '*', otherwise `thorn` is 0. `ret` is 1 if the next `i` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 0. `len` is the input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least one character.**
