Postcondition: `thorn` is either 0, 1, or 3, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `ret` is 0, and `i` is the next character in the list `s`. If `i` equals '@' and `thorn` is 1, `thorn` remains 1. If `i` does not equal '@' or `thorn` is not 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
