Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over each character in the list `s`.
   - The loop variable `i` represents the current character being processed.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `thorn` is 1 if `i` is '*', and 0 otherwise.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `len` is an input integer.
   - `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least one character.
   - `ret` is 0.
   - `i` is the first character in the list `s`.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over each character in `s`, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been set to the second character in `s`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the third character in `s`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `thorn` remains unchanged as it depends on the value of `i`, which changes with each iteration.
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `len` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `s` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `ret` remains 0 as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `i` is now the third character in `s`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`thorn` is 1 if `i` is '*', and 0 if `i` is not '*', `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least one character, `ret` is 0, and `i` is the third character in the list `s`.**
