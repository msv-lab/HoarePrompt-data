Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` and `k` are integers obtained from the second line of input after splitting and converting to integer, and `s` is the next line of input, with `n` and `k` now holding their respective integer values from the split input, regardless of whether `k` is greater than or equal to 2 or not.**
