Functionality: **The function processes input data from standard input, where each line contains two integers \(n\) and \(k\) separated by spaces. It prints a sequence of numbers based on the values of \(n\) and \(k\). If \(k \geq 2\) and \(n = k\), it prints \(k\) occurrences of \(k\). If \(k \geq 2\) and \(n \neq k\), it prints \(-1\). If \(k < 2\), it prints the sequence of numbers from 1 to \(n\). After processing all lines of input, the function concludes with all possible outputs printed.**
