Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided solution, we need to analyze whether the code correctly handles all the specified conditions and examples given in the problem statement.

1. **Handling \(k \geq 2\) and \(n = k\)**:
   - The code checks if `k >= 2` and `n == k`. If true, it prints `k` occurrences of `k`. This is correct because when `n == k`, every cyclic shift will be sorted, satisfying the requirement of exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts.

2. **Handling \(k \geq 2\) and \(n \neq k\)**:
   - The code correctly prints `-1` if `k >= 2` and `n != k`. This is correct because if `n != k`, it is impossible to have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts since having more than one sorted cyclic shift would require specific values that cannot be consistently maintained across all cyclic shifts without making all cyclic shifts sorted, which contradicts the condition \(n \neq k\).

3. **Handling \(k < 2\)**:
   - The code prints a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` if `k < 2`. This is correct because for small values of `k`, the simplest way to ensure fewer than 2 sorted cyclic shifts is to use a sequence of distinct numbers. Any cyclic shift of a sequence of distinct numbers will generally not be sorted unless the sequence is already sorted, which is not the case here.

4. **Examples**:
   - For the input `2 2`, the output is `1 1`, which is correct because both cyclic shifts `[1, 1]` are sorted.
   - For the input `3 1`, the output is `69420 69 420`, which is correct because only one cyclic shift `[69, 420, 69420]` is sorted.
   - For the input `3 2`, the output is `-1`, which is correct because it is impossible to have exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts with `n = 3`.

Given the analysis, the provided solution correctly handles all the conditions and examples provided in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
