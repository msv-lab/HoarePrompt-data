Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is the integer obtained from the second line of input after splitting and converting to integer, `k` is the integer obtained from the same line after splitting and converting to integer, and if `k` is greater than or equal to 2, then either `k` equals `n` or `n` does not equal `k`; if `k` is less than 2, then `k` remains less than 2.
