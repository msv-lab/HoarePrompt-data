Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through variables t, n, and k where t is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3. The function returns a result based on these inputs, though the specific result is not detailed here.**

This means the function indirectly accepts a series of test cases defined by the variables t, n, and k, and processes them according to their constraints, but the exact output of the function is not specified in the given information.
