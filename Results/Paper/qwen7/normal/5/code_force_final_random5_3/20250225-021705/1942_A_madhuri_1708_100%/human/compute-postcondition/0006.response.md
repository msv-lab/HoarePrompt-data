Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` is the integer obtained from the second line of input after splitting and converting to integer.
- `k` is the integer obtained from the same line after splitting and converting to integer.
- The current value of `k` is equal to `n` and greater than or equal to 2.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(*[k for j in range(k)])
```

This code creates a list comprehension that generates a list with `k` occurrences of the value `k`. The `*` operator is used to unpack this list so that each element is printed separately.

Given that `k` is the integer obtained from the second line of input and is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to 2, the output will be `k` printed `k` times.

Output: **k k ... k (k times)**
