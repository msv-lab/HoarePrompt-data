Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is the integer obtained from the second line of input after splitting and converting to integer, `k` is the integer obtained from the same line after splitting and converting to integer, and the current value of `k` is greater than or equal to 2, regardless of whether `n` equals `k` or not.
