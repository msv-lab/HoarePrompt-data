Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer obtained from the second line of input split and converted to integer, `k` is an integer obtained from the second line of input split and converted to integer, `s` is the next line of input.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, s.split())` takes the second line of input, splits it into individual components, and converts each component to an integer before assigning them to `n` and `k`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
