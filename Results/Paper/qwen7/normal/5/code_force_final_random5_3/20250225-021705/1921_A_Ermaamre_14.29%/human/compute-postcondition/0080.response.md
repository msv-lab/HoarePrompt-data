Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x1` and `y1` are input integers, `x2` and `y2` are input integers from the second input, `x3` and `y3` are input integers, `x4` and `y4` are integers from the input split by space, `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`**.

This means that the value of `res` is updated to the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`, while all other variables retain their initial conditions.
