Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is an input integer
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())
    x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())
    x3, y3 = map(int, input().split())
    x4, y4 = map(int, input().split())
    if x1 == x3 and x2 == x4:
        if y1 < y3:
            res = abs(y3 - y1)
        else:
            res = abs(y1 - y3)
    elif x1 == x2 and x3 == x4:
        if y1 < y2:
            res = abs(y2 - y1)
        else:
            res = abs(y1 - y2)
    elif x1 == x4 and x3 == x2:
        if y1 < y2:
            res = abs(y2 - y1)
        else:
            res = abs(y1 - y2)
    print(res ** 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an integer from the input, `y2` is an integer from the input, `x3` is the first integer from the input, `y3` is the second integer from the input, `x4` is the first integer from the input, `y4` is the second integer from the input, and in the end, `res` is the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1` if `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4` hold true, otherwise `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1` if `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4` or `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2` hold true.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` are input integers, `res` is the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1` if `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4` hold true, otherwise `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1` if `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4` or `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2` holds true, and `res` remains unchanged in other cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x1` and `y1` are input integers, `x2` and `y2` are input integers from the second input, `x3` and `y3` are input integers, `x4` and `y4` are integers from the input split by space, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3` if `x1` equals `x3` and `x2` equals `x4`, otherwise `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
