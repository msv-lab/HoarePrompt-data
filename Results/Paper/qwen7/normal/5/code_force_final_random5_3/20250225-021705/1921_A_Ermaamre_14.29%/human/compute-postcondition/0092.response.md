Postcondition: `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x1` and `y1` are input integers, `x2` and `y2` are input integers from the second input, `x3` and `y3` are input integers, `x4` and `y4` are integers from the input split by space, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` if `x1` equals `x2` and `x3` equals `x4`, otherwise `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3` if `x1` equals `x3` and `x2` equals `x4`.
