Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an input integer, `y2` is an input integer, `x3` is an input integer, `y3` is an input integer, `x4` is an input integer, `y4` is an input integer, `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `abs(y2 - y1)` to `res`. This means `res` is now the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`. The values of `a`, `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` remain unchanged from their initial states.
