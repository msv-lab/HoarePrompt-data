Postcondition: `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` are input integers, `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1` if `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4` or `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2` hold true, otherwise `res` remains the same as the initial condition where `res` is the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1` if `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4` hold true.
