Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x1` and `y1` are input integers, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` are input integers, `res` remains unchanged**.

Explanation: The code `x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x1` and `y1`. The values of `a`, `i`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4`, and `res` remain unchanged. The initial conditions for `a`, `i`, and the relationships involving `res` are preserved, but now `x1` and `y1` have specific values based on the input.
