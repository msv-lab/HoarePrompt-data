The function takes no input parameters. Each testcase is described over four lines, where each line contains two integers x_i, y_i such that -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000. There are t such testcases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and it is guaranteed that the given points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.
