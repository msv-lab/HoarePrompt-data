Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x1` and `y1` are input integers, `x2` and `y2` are input integers from the second input, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, and `y4` are input integers, `res` remains unchanged**

The code `x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input, splits them by whitespace, and converts them to integers, assigning them to `x2` and `y2`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
