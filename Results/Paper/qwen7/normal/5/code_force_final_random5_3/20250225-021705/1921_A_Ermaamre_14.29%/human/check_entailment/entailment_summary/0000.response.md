Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to calculate the area of a square by determining the side length from the given corner coordinates. However, the logic in the program is flawed. Specifically, the program only considers three out of the six possible pairs of opposite corners for calculating the side length. This means that the program will not correctly identify the side length for all possible configurations of the square's corners.

To correctly determine the side length of the square, we need to consider all pairs of points that could be opposite corners. Here's why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. The program checks only three specific pairs of opposite corners.
2. It does not account for the possibility that the given points might be arranged in other valid configurations that are not covered by the current logic.

Given these issues, the program will fail to correctly compute the side length for some test cases, leading to incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**
