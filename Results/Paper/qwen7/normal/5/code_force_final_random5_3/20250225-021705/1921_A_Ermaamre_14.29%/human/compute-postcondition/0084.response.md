Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x1` and `y1` are input integers, `x2` and `y2` are input integers from the second input, `x3` and `y3` are input integers, `x4` and `y4` are integers from the input split by space, `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1` to `res`. Since `y1` and `y2` are input integers, `res` will be the absolute value of their difference. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
