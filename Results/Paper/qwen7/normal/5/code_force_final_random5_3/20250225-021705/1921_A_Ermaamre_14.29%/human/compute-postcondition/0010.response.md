Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an integer from the input, `y2` is an integer from the input, `x3` is the first integer from the input, `y3` is the second integer from the input, `x4` is the first integer from the input, `y4` is the second integer from the input, the current value of `x1` is equal to `x3`, the current value of `x2` is equal to `x4`, `y1` is less than `y3`, `res` is the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1`.**

In this output state, the value of `res` is calculated as the absolute difference between `y3` and `y1`, which means `res = abs(y3 - y1)`. All other variables retain their initial conditions or relationships as described in the initial state.
