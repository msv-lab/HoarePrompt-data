Output State: The loop will execute `a` times, where `a` is the initial integer input. After all iterations, the variable `res` will be the result of the last condition evaluated within the loop. Specifically, `res` will be the absolute difference calculated based on the last set of inputs provided to the loop, following one of the three conditions specified in the loop body.

- If `x1 == x3` and `x2 == x4`, then `res` will be `abs(y3 - y1)`.
- If `x1 == x2` and `x3 == x4`, then `res` will be `abs(y2 - y1)`.
- If `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2`, then `res` will be `abs(y2 - y1)`.

The value of `res` will be printed as `res ** 2` after the final iteration of the loop. All other variables (`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4`) will retain their values from the last set of inputs provided to the loop.
