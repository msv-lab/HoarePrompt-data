Postcondition: `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an input integer, `y2` is an input integer, `x3` is an input integer, `y3` is an input integer, `x4` is an input integer, `y4` is an input integer, and `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1` if the condition `x1 == x4` and `x3 == x2` does not hold true; otherwise, `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.
