Functionality: **The function accepts no input parameters and returns the coordinates of the vertices of a square defined by given points with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.**

Given that the function does not accept any parameters and the problem description specifies that each test case is described over four lines with pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) forming a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area, the function must derive the coordinates of the vertices of such a square from the provided points.
