Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x1` and `y1` are input integers, `x2` and `y2` are input integers from the second input, `x3` and `y3` are input integers, `x4` and `y4` are integers from the input split by space, `res` remains unchanged**.

The code `x4, y4 = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input, separated by a space, and assigns them to `x4` and `y4`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
