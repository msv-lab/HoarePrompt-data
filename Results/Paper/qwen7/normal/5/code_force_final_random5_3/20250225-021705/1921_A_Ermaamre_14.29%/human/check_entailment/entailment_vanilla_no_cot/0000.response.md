Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly identify the sides of the square and calculate its area. It assumes a specific order of points which may not always be the case. Here's a more accurate approach:

1. Identify pairs of points that form horizontal and vertical segments.
2. Calculate the lengths of these segments to determine the side length of the square.
3. Square the side length to get the area.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        points = []
        for _ in range(4):
            x, y = map(int, input().split())
            points.append((x, y))
        
        # Find all unique distances between points
        distances = set()
        for i in range(4):
            for j in range(i + 1, 4):
                distance = ((points[i][0] - points[j][0]) ** 2 + (points[i][1] - points[j][1]) ** 2) ** 0.5
                distances.add(distance)
        
        # The side length of the square should be the smallest non-zero distance
        side_length = min(distances)
        
        # The area of the square is the side length squared
        area = side_length ** 2
        print(area)

func()
```

This corrected program will work for any permutation of the corner points and correctly compute the area of the square.
