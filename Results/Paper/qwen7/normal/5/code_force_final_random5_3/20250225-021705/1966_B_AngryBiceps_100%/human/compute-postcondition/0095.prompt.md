You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500, and n * m ≤ 3 * 10^5; each test case consists of n lines, each containing m characters 'W' (for white) and 'B' (for black), representing the initial colors of the grid.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = []
        
        first_row = ''
        
        last_row = ''
        
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(input())
            first_row += a[-1][0]
            last_row += a[-1][-1]
        
        if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and len(set(a[-1])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
            print('NO')
        elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and len(set(last_row)
            ) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is equal to `n`, `a` is a list of length `n` containing all the inputs in the order they were provided, `first_row` is a string formed by taking the first character of each string in `a`, and `last_row` is a string formed by taking the last character of each string in `a`. The loop processes all the test cases provided as input, and based on the conditions checked within the loop, it prints either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case. If any test case meets the conditions to print 'NO', the loop will print 'NO' for that specific test case. Otherwise, for all other test cases, it will print 'YES'. The final state of `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` will reflect the last processed test case's data, and the loop will terminate once all test cases have been processed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes a grid represented by n lines, each containing m characters 'W' (for white) and 'B' (for black). The function returns the count of test cases that meet certain conditions based on the grid configuration.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
