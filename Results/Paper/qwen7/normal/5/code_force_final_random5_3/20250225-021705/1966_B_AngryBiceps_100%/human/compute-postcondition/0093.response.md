Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is equal to `n`, `a` is a list of length `n` containing all the inputs in the order they were provided, `first_row` is a string formed by taking the first character of each string in `a`, and `last_row` is a string formed by taking the last character of each string in `a`. The loop processes all the test cases provided as input, and based on the conditions checked within the loop, it prints either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case. If any test case meets the conditions to print 'NO', the loop will print 'NO' for that specific test case. Otherwise, for all other test cases, it will print 'YES'. The final state of `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` will reflect the last processed test case's data, and the loop will terminate once all test cases have been processed.
