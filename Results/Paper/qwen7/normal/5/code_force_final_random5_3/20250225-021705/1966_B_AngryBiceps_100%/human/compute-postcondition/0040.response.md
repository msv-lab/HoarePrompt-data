Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `last_row` is the input integer plus the last element of the last sublist in `a`.
   - `a` is a list containing two elements where the first element is an input integer and the second element is the input from `input()`.
   - `first_row` is the input integer plus the first element of the last sublist in `a`.
   - `m` is an input integer.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is currently equal to `n`, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `n + 1`.

5. **Maintain other states**: The other states (`n`, `last_row`, `a`, `first_row`, and `m`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

So, the updated state for the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `last_row` is the input integer plus the last element of the last sublist in `a`, `a` is a list containing two elements where the first element is an input integer and the second element is the input from `input()`, `first_row` is the input integer plus the first element of the last sublist in `a`, `m` is an input integer**.
