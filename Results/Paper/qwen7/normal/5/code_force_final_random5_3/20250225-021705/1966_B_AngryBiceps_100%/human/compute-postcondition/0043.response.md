Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `last_row` is the input integer plus twice the last element of the last sublist in `a`, `a` is a list containing three elements where the first element is an input integer, the second element is the input from `input()`, and the third element is the new input from `input()`, `first_row` is the input integer plus the first element of the last sublist in `a` plus the first element of the last sublist in `a`, `m` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `last_row += a[-1][-1]` increments `last_row` by the last element of the last sublist in `a`. Since `last_row` was initially the input integer plus the last element of the last sublist in `a`, after executing the code, `last_row` becomes the input integer plus twice the last element of the last sublist in `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
