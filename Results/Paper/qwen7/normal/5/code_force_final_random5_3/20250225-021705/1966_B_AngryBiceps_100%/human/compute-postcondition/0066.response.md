Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(n):` will execute as long as `n` is a non-negative integer (greater than or equal to 0).
   - The variable `i` will take values from 0 to `n-1` during each iteration of the loop.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `n` is an integer obtained from `int(input()) - 1`, it must be a valid non-negative integer.
   - The initial value of `i` will be 0 because the loop starts with `i = 0`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `n` is a non-negative integer and `i` is set to 0.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

**State: **`n` must be a non-negative integer, `i` is 0**.
