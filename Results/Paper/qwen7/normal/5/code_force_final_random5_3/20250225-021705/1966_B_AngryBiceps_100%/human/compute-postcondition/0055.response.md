Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n+1`, and `n` is greater than 0.
- `last_row` is the input integer plus `(n-1)` times the last element of the last sublist in `a`.
- `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being an input from `input()`.
- `first_row` is the input integer plus the sum of the first elements of all sublists in `a`.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `a[0]` contains at least two different elements, or `a[-1]` contains at least two different elements, or `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, `first_row` has at least two different elements, or `last_row` has at least two different elements, or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
