Output State: **`n` is an integer from `int(input()) - 1`, `m` is an integer from `input().split()`, `a` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `a`. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `n` is still an integer derived from `int(input()) - 1`, and `m` is still an integer from `input().split()`. The new information is that `a` is now an empty list.
