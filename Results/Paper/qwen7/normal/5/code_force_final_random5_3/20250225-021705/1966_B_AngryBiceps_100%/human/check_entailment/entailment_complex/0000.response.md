Reasoning:
The provided solution has some logical flaws that prevent it from correctly determining whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Conditions for 'NO'**: The current logic only checks if the first and last rows or the first and last characters of each row are uniform but different. This is not sufficient to determine if it's possible to make all squares the same color. For example, consider a grid where the first and last rows are the same and contain alternating 'W' and 'B'. The current logic would incorrectly print 'YES' for such a grid, but it is not possible to make all squares the same color with the given operations.

2. **Lack of General Strategy**: The solution does not provide a general strategy to check if it is possible to make all squares the same color. It only checks specific conditions that do not cover all possible scenarios.

3. **Misinterpretation of Operations**: The operations allow changing the color of a subrectangle defined by any two squares of the same color. The current logic does not account for the possibility of merging different regions of the same color through a series of operations.

Given these issues, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
