Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `last_row` is an empty string, `n` is an input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string, `m` is an input integer
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a.append(input())
    first_row += a[-1][0]
    last_row += a[-1][-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `last_row` is the input integer, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is a list containing one element which is an input integer, `first_row` is the input integer, `m` is an input integer

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `last_row` is the input integer plus the last element of the last sublist in `a`, `a` is a list containing two elements where the first element is an input integer and the second element is the input from `input()`, `first_row` is the input integer plus the first element of the last sublist in `a`, `m` is an input integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `last_row` is the input integer plus twice the last element of the last sublist in `a`, `a` is a list containing three elements where the first element is an input integer, the second element is the input from `input()`, and the third element is the new input from `input()`, `first_row` is the input integer plus the first element of the last sublist in `a` plus the first element of the last sublist in `a`, `m` is an input integer




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
