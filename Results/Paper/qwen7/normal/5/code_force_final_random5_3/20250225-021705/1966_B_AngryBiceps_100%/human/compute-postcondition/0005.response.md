State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration.
- The loop condition `range(n)` means the loop will run as long as `i < n`.
- For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute even once.
- Initially, `i` is set to 0, so no adjustment is needed for `i`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring `n` is greater than 0.
