Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is equal to `n-1`.
- `a` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an input from the user.
- `first_row` is a string formed by concatenating the first character of each element in the list `a`.
- `last_row` is a string formed by concatenating the last character of each element in the list `a`.

The conditions for `first_row` and `last_row` are:
- The first element of `a` contains at least two different characters, or
- The last element of `a` contains at least two different characters, or
- Both the first and last elements of `a` contain only one character but are the same, and either `first_row` and `last_row` both contain more than one unique character or `first_row` and `last_row` are equal.

Regardless of the specific values of `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row`, the print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
