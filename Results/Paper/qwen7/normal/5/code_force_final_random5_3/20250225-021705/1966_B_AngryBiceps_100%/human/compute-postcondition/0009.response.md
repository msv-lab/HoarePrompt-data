Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a` is a list with one element which is an input from the user.
   - `first_row` is equal to the first element of the only element in list `a`.
   - `last_row` is the last element of the last element in list `a`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must remain greater than 0.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `i` changes from 0 to 1.
   - `n` remains greater than 0 (no change needed here as it was already greater than 0).

6. **State at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.
   - `i` is now 1.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1**.
