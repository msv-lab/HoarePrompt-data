Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `a` is a list containing the first element as the input from the user.
   - `first_row` is the first element of the list `a`.
   - `last_row` is the last element of the last sublist in the list `a` plus the last element of the last sublist in the list `a`.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue if `i < n`.

4. **Update the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged because it is determined by the condition of the loop and not modified within the loop itself.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` is updated to 2.
   - `n` remains as it was (greater than 0).
   - `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is a list containing the first element as the input from the user, `first_row` is the first element of the list `a`, `last_row` is the last element of the last sublist in the list `a` plus the last element of the last sublist in the list `a`**.
