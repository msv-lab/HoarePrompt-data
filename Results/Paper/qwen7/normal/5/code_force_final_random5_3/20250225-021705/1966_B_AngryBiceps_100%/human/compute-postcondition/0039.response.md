Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `last_row` is the input integer plus the last element of the last sublist in `a`, `a` is a list containing two elements where the first element is an input integer and the second element is the input from `input()`, `first_row` is the input integer plus the first element of the last sublist in `a`, `m` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `last_row += a[-1][-1]` increments the value of `last_row` by the last element of the last sublist in `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
