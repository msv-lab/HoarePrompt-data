Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list with one element which is the input from the user.**

The code `a.append(input())` appends the input from the user to the list `a`. Since `n` and `i` are not affected by this operation, their values remain unchanged. The list `a` is updated to include the input as its first (and only) element.
