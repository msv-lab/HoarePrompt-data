Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `a` is a list containing `n` elements where each element is an input from the user, `first_row` is a string formed by concatenating the first character of each element in the list `a`, and `last_row` is a string formed by concatenating the last character of each element in the list `a`.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `n` will still hold the value it was initialized with, but `i` will now be `n-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`. The list `a` will contain `n` elements, each being an input received from the user during the respective iteration. The string `first_row` will consist of the first character of each element in the list `a`, concatenated together, and `last_row` will consist of the last character of each element in the list `a`, also concatenated together.
