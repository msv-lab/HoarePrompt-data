Output State: **`last_row` is the input integer, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is a list containing one element which is an input integer, `first_row` is the input integer, `m` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code appends the last element of the list `a` (which is an input integer) to the string `last_row`. Since `a` contains only one element, which is the same as `first_row`, appending the last element of `a` to `last_row` means `last_row` now holds the value of the input integer. All other variables remain unchanged.
