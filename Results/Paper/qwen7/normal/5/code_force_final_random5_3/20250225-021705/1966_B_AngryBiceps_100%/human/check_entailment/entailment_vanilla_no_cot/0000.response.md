Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly determining whether it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the specified operations.

1. **Incorrect Conditions for "NO":**
   - The conditions `len(set(a[0])) == 1 and len(set(a[-1])) == 1 and (a[0] != a[-1])` and `len(set(first_row)) == 1 and len(set(last_row)) == 1 and (first_row != last_row)` are not sufficient to determine if it's impossible to make all squares the same color.
   - These conditions only check if the first and last rows are different but still have the same color, which is not a definitive way to determine the impossibility of making all squares the same color.

2. **Missing Consideration of Other Rows:**
   - The solution does not consider the colors of other rows in the grid. It only checks the first and last rows, which is insufficient.

3. **Incorrect Logic for "YES":**
   - If the conditions for "NO" are not met, the solution prints "YES". However, this is not always correct. There might be configurations where it's possible to make all squares the same color even if the first and last rows are not as described.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to check if there exists a consistent color throughout the entire grid. Hereâ€™s a revised version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = []
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(input())
        
        # Check if all rows are the same
        if all(row == a[0] for row in a):
            print('YES')
        # Check if all columns are the same
        elif all(a[i][j] == a[0][0] for i in range(n) for j in range(m)):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

### Explanation of the Correct Solution:
- **Check All Rows:** If all rows are the same, then it's possible to make all squares the same color.
- **Check All Columns:** If all columns are the same, then it's also possible to make all squares the same color.
- **Otherwise:** If neither condition is met, it's not possible to make all squares the same color.

This approach ensures that the solution correctly identifies whether it's possible to make all squares the same color based on the given operations.
