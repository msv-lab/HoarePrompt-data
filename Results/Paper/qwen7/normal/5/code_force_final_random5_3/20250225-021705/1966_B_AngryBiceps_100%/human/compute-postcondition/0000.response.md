Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `_`, which is a placeholder used to iterate over the range of values returned by `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` returns a non-zero value. Since `t` is defined as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the input will always return a valid integer within this range.

3. **Adjust the state**: We need to ensure that the input function will return a valid integer `t` that satisfies the given constraints. Therefore, the state before the loop starts should include the condition that the input will provide a valid `t`.

Given these points, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to reflect that the input will provide a valid integer `t` within the specified range.

**State:**
**`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
