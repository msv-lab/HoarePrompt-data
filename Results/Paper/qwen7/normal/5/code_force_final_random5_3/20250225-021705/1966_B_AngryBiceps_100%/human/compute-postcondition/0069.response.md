Output State: **`n` must be a non-negative integer, `i` is 0, `a` is a list containing one element which is the input provided by the user, `first_row` is equal to the first element of the only element in list `a`, `last_row` is the last element of the last element in list `a`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `last_row` by adding the last element of the last element in the list `a`. Since `a` contains only one element (which is a list), `last_row` is updated to be the last element of that single element list. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
