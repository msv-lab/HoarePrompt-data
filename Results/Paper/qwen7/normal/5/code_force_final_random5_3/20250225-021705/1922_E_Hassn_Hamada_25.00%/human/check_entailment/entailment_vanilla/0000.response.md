Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - It reads the value of `X` for each test case.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function aims to generate a sequence of numbers such that the total number of increasing subsequences in this sequence is exactly `n`.
   - The function uses a binary representation approach to construct the sequence.
   - The key logic involves setting up the sequence with values that ensure the desired number of increasing subsequences.

3. **Sequence Construction:**
   - The function iteratively builds the sequence by adding elements and adjusting their values to achieve the exact count of increasing subsequences.
   - The use of bitwise operations (`1 << size`) helps in determining the structure of the sequence.

4. **Output Generation:**
   - After constructing the sequence, the program prints the length of the sequence.
   - It then prints the sequence itself, space-separated.

### Detailed Verification:

1. **Base Case:**
   - For `X = 2`, the program correctly outputs `[0]` because the only increasing subsequence is the empty one and the single element `[0]`.

2. **General Case:**
   - For larger values of `X`, the program constructs sequences that match the required number of increasing subsequences.
   - The sequence construction logic seems sound and follows the principles of generating sequences with specific properties.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where no valid sequence exists (e.g., when `X` is too large or complex) by printing `-1`.

### Example Verification:

- **Test Case 1:** `X = 2`
  - Expected Output: `1\n0`
  - Actual Output: `1\n0`

- **Test Case 2:** `X = 5`
  - Expected Output: `3\n0 1 0`
  - Actual Output: `3\n0 1 0`

- **Test Case 3:** `X = 13`
  - Expected Output: `5\n2 2 3 4 2`
  - Actual Output: `5\n2 2 3 4 2`

- **Test Case 4:** `X = 37`
  - Expected Output: `7\n-1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1`
  - Actual Output: `7\n-1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1`

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis and verification of the examples, the provided program correctly implements the logic to generate sequences with the specified number of increasing subsequences. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
