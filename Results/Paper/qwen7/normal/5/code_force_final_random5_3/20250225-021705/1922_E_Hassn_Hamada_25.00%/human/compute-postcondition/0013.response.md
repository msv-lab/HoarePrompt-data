Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `size`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < size`. This means the loop will run `size` times.

3. **Determine the Final Value of `size`**: We know that `size` is set to 5 after the loop completes. The loop increments `size` by 1 each time it runs, and it stops when `(1 << size + 1) - 1` exceeds `number`. Given that `number` must be at least 15 after 3 iterations, the loop will continue until `(1 << 5 + 1) - 1 = 31` is no longer less than or equal to `number`.

4. **Initial State of `size`**: Since the loop will run 5 times, `size` must be initialized to a value that allows the loop to run exactly 5 times. The loop will start with `i = 0` and increment `size` by 1 each time, so `size` must be initialized to 4 (because the loop will run from `i = 0` to `i = 4`, making it 5 iterations).

5. **Initial State of `number`**: The problem states that `number` must be greater than or equal to 31 for the loop to stop. Therefore, `number` should be initialized to a value that ensures the loop runs 5 times.

Given this analysis, the initial state before the loop starts should be:

- `size` is initialized to 4.
- `number` is initialized to a value that ensures the loop runs 5 times, which is at least 31.

So, the final state before the loop starts is:

**State: **`size` is 4, `number` must be greater than or equal to 31**.
