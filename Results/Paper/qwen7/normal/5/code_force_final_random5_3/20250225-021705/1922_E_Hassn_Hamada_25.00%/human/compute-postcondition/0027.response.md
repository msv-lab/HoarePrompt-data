Output State: **`size` is 5, `i` is 6, `sequence` is undefined, `result` is undefined, `sequence[-result - i - 1]` is incremented by `result`**

Explanation: The code attempts to modify an element in the `sequence` list using the index `sequence[-result - i - 1]`. However, since `result` is undefined, we cannot determine the exact index being accessed or the value being added. Therefore, the only change is that `sequence[-result - i - 1]` is incremented by `result`. The values of `size`, `i`, `sequence`, and `result` remain unchanged.
