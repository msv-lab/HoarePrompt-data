Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually. For each test case, it aims to generate an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to generate a sequence of numbers based on the input `number`.
   - The function uses a binary search-like approach to determine the size of the sequence needed to achieve at least `X` increasing subsequences.
   - The key logic is in the loop where `size` is incremented until `(1 << (size + 1)) - 1` exceeds `number`.

3. **Sequence Generation**:
   - Once the appropriate `size` is determined, the function appends `size` copies of `size` to the sequence.
   - This ensures that the number of increasing subsequences is at least the sum of the first `size` natural numbers, which is `(1 << (size + 1)) - 1`.

4. **Recursive Call**:
   - The function makes a recursive call to handle the remaining part of `number` after accounting for the initial part.
   - The modifications to `sequence` and `result` inside the loop are intended to adjust the sequence to ensure the exact count of increasing subsequences.

5. **Output**:
   - The length of the sequence is printed, followed by the sequence itself.

Given the above analysis, the function `func_1` correctly generates a sequence that meets the requirements for the number of increasing subsequences. The logic is sound and aligns with the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
