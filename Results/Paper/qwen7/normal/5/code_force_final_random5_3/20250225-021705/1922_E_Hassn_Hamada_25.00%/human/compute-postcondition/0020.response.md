Output State: `size` is 5, `i` is 4, `number` must be greater than or equal to 31, `sequence` is [4, 4, 4, 4, 4].

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `size` will be 5 because the loop increments `size` by 1 each time it runs until `(1 << size + 1) - 1` (which equals 31) is no longer less than or equal to `number`. Since `number` must be at least 31, the loop will run 5 times, setting `i` to 4 each time. The `sequence` list will contain 5 elements, all of which are 4.
