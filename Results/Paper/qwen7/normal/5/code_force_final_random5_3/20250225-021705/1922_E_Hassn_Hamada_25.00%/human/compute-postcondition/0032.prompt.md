You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: number is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000), and for each test case, sequence is a list of integers where each integer X satisfies (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^{18}).
def func_1(number, sequence):
    """
    Generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number.

    Args:
        number (int): The input number to generate sequence for
        sequence (List[int]): The output sequence 

    Returns: 
        int: The size of generated sequence

    if (number == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: number is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000), and for each test case, sequence is a list of integers where each integer X satisfies (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^{18}), and the function has been called to generate the sequence of numbers based on the input number
    size = 1
    while (1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number:
        size += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `size` is 5 and `number` must be greater than or equal to 31.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `size` will be 5 because the loop increments `size` by 1 each time it runs, and it stops when `(1 << size + 1) - 1` exceeds `number`. Given that after 3 iterations `number` must be at least 15, the loop will continue until `(1 << 5 + 1) - 1 = 31` is no longer less than or equal to `number`. Thus, `size` becomes 5.
    for i in range(size):
        sequence.append(i)
        
    #State: Output State: `size` is 5, `i` is 4, `number` must be greater than or equal to 31, `sequence` is [4, 4, 4, 4, 4].
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `size` will be 5 because the loop increments `size` by 1 each time it runs until `(1 << size + 1) - 1` (which equals 31) is no longer less than or equal to `number`. Since `number` must be at least 31, the loop will run 5 times, setting `i` to 4 each time. The `sequence` list will contain 5 elements, all of which are 4.
    result = func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)
    for i in range(size):
        assert -len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1
        
        sequence[-result - i - 1] += result
        
    #State: Output State: `size` is 5, `i` is 7, `sequence` is undefined, `result` is undefined.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = size - 1`, which means it will run 5 times since `size` is initially 5. After the first iteration (`i = 0`), `i` becomes 4. After the second iteration (`i = 1`), `i` becomes 5. After the third iteration (`i = 2`), `i` becomes 6. Following this pattern, after the fourth iteration (`i = 3`), `i` becomes 7. Since the loop modifies `sequence` and `result` based on the current value of `i`, and these modifications are not defined beyond the third iteration, we can conclude that `sequence` and `result` are undefined after the loop completes all its iterations.
    return size + result
    #The program returns 5 + result, where result is undefined
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `number`, an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000), and `sequence`, a list of integers where each integer X satisfies (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^{18}). It returns either 0 or 5 plus an undefined result depending on the input.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns 5 + result, where result is undefined


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
