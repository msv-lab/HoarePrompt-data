You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

    assert number >= 0
    if number == 0:

        size += 1
    for i in range(size):
        sequence.append(i)
    result = func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)
    for i in range(size):
        assert -len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1
        sequence[-result - i - 1] += result
    return size + result



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `number`, an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000), and `sequence`, a list of integers where each integer X satisfies (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^{18}). It returns either 0 or 5 plus an undefined result depending on the input. If `number` is 0, the function immediately returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates a size such that `(1 << size + 1) - 1` is just greater than `number`, then fills the `sequence` list with the same integer repeated `size` times. Finally, it recursively calls itself with updated parameters and modifies the `sequence` list based on the result of the recursive call before returning the sum of the calculated size and the result of the recursive call.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to generate an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The function `func_1` attempts to generate a sequence based on the input `number`, but it does not ensure that the resulting array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:

- Input: `X = 37`

The program generates an array `[0, 0, 2, 3, -1, -1, 0]`. However, this array does not have exactly 37 increasing subsequences. For instance, the subsequence `[0, 2, 3]` is counted multiple times due to the presence of `-1` values, which do not contribute to increasing subsequences but complicate the counting logic.

A correct implementation would need to carefully manage the generation of the array to ensure that the exact number of increasing subsequences matches `X`. The current approach does not guarantee this, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
