Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(size)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `size`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `size` is 4.
   - `number` must be greater than or equal to 31.
   - `sequence` is a list with one element `i`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < size`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the variable being incremented in the loop, it will be increased by 1 at the start of each new iteration.
   - Therefore, if `i` was used in the previous iteration, it will now be `i + 1`.
   - The value of `size` remains unchanged because it is defined outside the loop and does not change within the loop.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `size` remains 4.
   - `i` will be increased by 1 from the previous value (let's assume `i` was 3 in the previous iteration, so it will now be 4).
   - `number` must still be greater than or equal to 31.
   - `sequence` will now contain the new value of `i`, which is 4.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`size` is 4, `i` is 4, `number` must be greater than or equal to 31, `sequence` is a list with one element 4**
