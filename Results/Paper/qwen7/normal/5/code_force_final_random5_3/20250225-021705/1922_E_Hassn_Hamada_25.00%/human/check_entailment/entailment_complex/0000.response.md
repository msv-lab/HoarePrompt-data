Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to generate a sequence of integers such that the number of increasing subsequences in the sequence is exactly `X`.
   - The function uses a binary representation approach to construct the sequence. Specifically, it determines the smallest `size` such that `(1 << (size + 1)) - 1` (which is \(2^{size+1} - 1\)) is just greater than or equal to `X`.
   - It then creates a sequence of `size` elements, all set to `size - 1`. This ensures that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `X`.

2. **Recursive Call and Sequence Modification**:
   - The function makes a recursive call with `number - (1 << size) + 1` and updates the sequence accordingly.
   - The recursive call ensures that the sequence is correctly modified to achieve the desired number of increasing subsequences.

3. **Sequence Construction**:
   - For `X = 2`, the sequence `[0]` is correct because it has exactly one increasing subsequence (the empty subsequence) and one non-empty increasing subsequence (the sequence itself).
   - For larger values of `X`, the sequence construction ensures that the number of increasing subsequences matches the required value.

4. **Output Handling**:
   - The main program correctly prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself.
   - The logic for handling different test cases is sound, and the function `func_1` correctly constructs the sequence for the given `X`.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to generate a sequence with exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

Correctness: **True**
