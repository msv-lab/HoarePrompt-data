Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `number`, an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000), and `sequence`, a list of integers where each integer X satisfies (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^{18}). It returns either 0 or 5 plus an undefined result depending on the input. If `number` is 0, the function immediately returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates a size such that `(1 << size + 1) - 1` is just greater than `number`, then fills the `sequence` list with the same integer repeated `size` times. Finally, it recursively calls itself with updated parameters and modifies the `sequence` list based on the result of the recursive call before returning the sum of the calculated size and the result of the recursive call.**
