Output State: `size` is 5, `i` is 7, `sequence` is undefined, `result` is undefined.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = size - 1`, which means it will run 5 times since `size` is 5. After each iteration, `i` increments by 1. Therefore, after 5 iterations, `i` will be 5 + 2 = 7. The problem statement indicates that the `sequence` and `result` become undefined after the loop has executed 2 times, and this state persists through the remaining iterations. Thus, after all iterations, `i` will be 7, and both `sequence` and `result` will remain undefined.
