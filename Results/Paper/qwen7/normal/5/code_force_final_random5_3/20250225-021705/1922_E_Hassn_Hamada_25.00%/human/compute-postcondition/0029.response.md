Output State: `size` is 5, `i` is 7, `sequence` is undefined, `result` is undefined.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = size - 1`, which means it will run 5 times since `size` is initially 5. After the first iteration (`i = 0`), `i` becomes 4. After the second iteration (`i = 1`), `i` becomes 5. After the third iteration (`i = 2`), `i` becomes 6. Following this pattern, after the fourth iteration (`i = 3`), `i` becomes 7. Since the loop modifies `sequence` and `result` based on the current value of `i`, and these modifications are not defined beyond the third iteration, we can conclude that `sequence` and `result` are undefined after the loop completes all its iterations.
