Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is given by the expression `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number`.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
   - `size` is 2
   - `number` must be greater than or equal to 3

3. **Evaluate the Loop Condition**: Substitute the current values into the loop condition:
   - `(1 << (2 + 1)) - 1 = (1 << 3) - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7`
   - The condition becomes `7 <= number`

4. **Determine the Next Iteration Requirement**: For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `7 <= number` must still hold true.

5. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop condition involves `number`, we need to ensure that `number` remains such that the condition holds. Given that `number` must be greater than or equal to 3 at the start and the condition requires `number` to be at least 7, `number` must be greater than or equal to 7 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `number` must be greater than or equal to 7.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`size` is 2 and `number` must be greater than or equal to 7**
