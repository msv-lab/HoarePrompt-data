Output State: **`size` is 5, `i` is 5, `sequence` is undefined, `result` is undefined**

Explanation: The code snippet provided attempts to modify an element in a list (`sequence`) using indices and a variable (`result`). However, the variable `result` is not defined anywhere in the given code or initial state. Additionally, the variable `sequence` is not defined in the initial state or within the provided code snippet. Without knowing the value of `result` and the definition of `sequence`, we cannot determine the exact changes made to these variables. Therefore, the only variables mentioned in the initial state remain unchanged, and the new variables (`result` and `sequence`) are undefined.
