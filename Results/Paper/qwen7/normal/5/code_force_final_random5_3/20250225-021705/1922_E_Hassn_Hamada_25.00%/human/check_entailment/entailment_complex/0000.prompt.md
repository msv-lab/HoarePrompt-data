Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

    #State: Output State: `size` is 5 and `number` must be greater than or equal to 31.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `size` will be 5 because the loop increments `size` by 1 each time it runs, and it stops when `(1 << size + 1) - 1` exceeds `number`. Given that after 3 iterations `number` must be at least 15, the loop will continue until `(1 << 5 + 1) - 1 = 31` is no longer less than or equal to `number`. Thus, `size` becomes 5.
    for i in range(size):
        sequence.append(i)
        
    #State: Output State: `size` is 5, `i` is 4, `number` must be greater than or equal to 31, `sequence` is [4, 4, 4, 4, 4].
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `size` will be 5 because the loop increments `size` by 1 each time it runs until `(1 << size + 1) - 1` (which equals 31) is no longer less than or equal to `number`. Since `number` must be at least 31, the loop will run 5 times, setting `i` to 4 each time. The `sequence` list will contain 5 elements, all of which are 4.
    result = func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)
    for i in range(size):
        assert -len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1
        
        sequence[-result - i - 1] += result
        
    #State: Output State: `size` is 5, `i` is 7, `sequence` is undefined, `result` is undefined.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = size - 1`, which means it will run 5 times since `size` is initially 5. After the first iteration (`i = 0`), `i` becomes 4. After the second iteration (`i = 1`), `i` becomes 5. After the third iteration (`i = 2`), `i` becomes 6. Following this pattern, after the fourth iteration (`i = 3`), `i` becomes 7. Since the loop modifies `sequence` and `result` based on the current value of `i`, and these modifications are not defined beyond the third iteration, we can conclude that `sequence` and `result` are undefined after the loop completes all its iterations.
    return size + result
    #The program returns 5 + result, where result is undefined
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `number`, an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000), and `sequence`, a list of integers where each integer X satisfies (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^{18}). It returns either 0 or 5 plus an undefined result depending on the input. If `number` is 0, the function immediately returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates a size such that `(1 << size + 1) - 1` is just greater than `number`, then fills the `sequence` list with the same integer repeated `size` times. Finally, it recursively calls itself with updated parameters and modifies the `sequence` list based on the result of the recursive call before returning the sum of the calculated size and the result of the recursive call.
