Output State: **`idx` is 24, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the new input integer from `map(int, input().split())`, `k` must be at least \(2^{25}\), `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) with `nums[23]` being `k - 2^{23}`, and an additional element `k + 1 + nums[23]`, and the element \(1 \ll 23\) (which is \(2^{23}\)) has been removed from `nums`.**

Explanation: The initial value of `idx` was 25. The code snippet `idx -= 1` decrements `idx` by 1. Therefore, `idx` is now 24. All other variables remain unchanged.
