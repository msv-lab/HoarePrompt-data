Output State: **`idx` is 3, `k` must be at least 8, `nums` does not contain the element 1 << 3 (which is 8), and the last element of `nums` is k + 4.**

Explanation: The code removes the element `1 << idx` from the list `nums`. Given that `idx` is 3, `1 << idx` equals `1 << 3`, which is 8. Since `k` must be at least 8, the last element of `nums` before removal was `k + 4`. After removing 8 from `nums`, the last element remains `k + 4` because the removal does not affect the last element's value.
