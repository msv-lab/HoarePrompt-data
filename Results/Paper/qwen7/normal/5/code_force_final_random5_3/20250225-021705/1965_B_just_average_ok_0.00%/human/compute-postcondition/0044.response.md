Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `k >= 1 << idx`.
2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `idx` is 1.
   - `k` must be at least 1.

3. **Determine the Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables involved in the loop head are `k` and `idx`.

4. **Analyze the Loop Condition**:
   - The expression `1 << idx` means shifting the binary number 1 left by `idx` positions.
   - Since `idx` is currently 1, `1 << idx` evaluates to `1 << 1`, which is 2.

5. **Loop Condition Evaluation**:
   - The loop continues as long as `k >= 2`.

6. **Adjusting the States**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be at least 2.
   - `idx` remains unchanged because the loop condition does not depend on `idx` changing; it only depends on `k`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `k` is at least 2.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`idx` is 1, `k` must be at least 2**
