Output State: `idx` is 25, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the new input integer from `map(int, input().split())`, `k` must be at least \(2^{25}\), `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) with `nums[23]` being `k - 2^{23}`, and an additional element `k + 1 + nums[23]`, and the element \(1 \ll 23\) (which is \(2^{23}\)) has been removed from `nums`.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `k` is greater than or equal to \(1 \ll idx\). Given that the loop executed 3 times up to `idx` being 4, we can deduce that `k` was at least \(2^4 = 16\). Each iteration of the loop increments `idx` by 1, so after 25 iterations, `idx` would be 25. For the loop to execute 25 times, `k` must be at least \(2^{25}\).
