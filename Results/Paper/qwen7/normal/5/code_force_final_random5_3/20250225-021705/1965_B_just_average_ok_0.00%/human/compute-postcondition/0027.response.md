Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `k >= 1 << idx`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `idx` is 3.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
   - `n` is the new input integer from `map(int, input().split())`.
   - `k` must be greater than or equal to 4.
   - `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) with `nums[23]` being `k - 2^{23}`, and an additional element `k + 1 + nums[23]`, and the element \(1 \ll 23\) (which is \(2^{23}\)) has been removed from `nums`.

3. **Determine which states need to be adjusted**:
   - The loop condition depends on `k` and `idx`.
   - `idx` is fixed at 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `k` must satisfy the condition `k >= 1 << idx`.

4. **Calculate the condition for the next iteration**:
   - Since `idx` is 3, the condition becomes `k >= 1 << 3`, which simplifies to `k >= 8`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - To ensure the loop executes one more time, `k` must be at least 8.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `k` is at least 8.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`idx` is 3, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the new input integer from `map(int, input().split())`, `k` must be at least 8, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) with `nums[23]` being `k - 2^{23}`, and an additional element `k + 1 + nums[23]`, and the element \(1 \ll 23\) (which is \(2^{23}\)) has been removed from `nums`.**
