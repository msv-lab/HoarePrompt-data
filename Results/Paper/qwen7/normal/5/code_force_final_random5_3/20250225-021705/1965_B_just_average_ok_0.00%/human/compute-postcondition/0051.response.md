Output State: **`idx` is 3, `k` must be at least 8, `nums` is a list with the last element being k - 3**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `k - nums[idx]` to the list `nums`. Given that `idx` is 3 and `k` must be at least 8, the last element added to `nums` is `k - 3`. The other variables remain unchanged.
