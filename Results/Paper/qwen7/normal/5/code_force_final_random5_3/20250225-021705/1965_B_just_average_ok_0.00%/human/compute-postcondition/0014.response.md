Output State: **`idx` is 23, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first integer input split from a line of input, `k` must be at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing integers from 2^0 to 2^23 with `nums[23]` being `k - 2^23`, and `nums` now contains an additional element `k + 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends `k + 1` to the list `nums`. Initially, `nums` contained integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\), and `nums[23]` was `k - 2^{23}`. After appending `k + 1`, the list `nums` now includes this new element. All other variables remain unchanged.
