Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires constructing a sequence `a` of non-negative integers such that:
   - No subsequence sums to `k`.
   - All integers from 1 to `n` (except `k`) must be representable as a subsequence sum.

2. **Key Insight**: To satisfy the conditions, the sequence can be constructed using powers of 2 and ensuring that `k` itself is not directly included in the sequence but can be formed by other means (e.g., through the combination of other elements).

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code iterates over each test case.
   - It constructs a list `nums` which initially contains powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\) (since the maximum size of the sequence is 25).
   - It then modifies `nums` to include specific values derived from `k`:
     - `k - 2^{\text{idx} - 1}` (where `idx` is the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`).
     - `k + 1`.
     - `k + 2^{\text{idx} - 1} + 1`.
     - Removes `2^{\text{idx}}` from `nums`.

4. **Verification**:
   - **No Subsequence Summing to `k`**: By removing `2^{\text{idx}}` and including `k - 2^{\text{idx} - 1}`, `k` cannot be formed as a direct sum of any subset of `nums`.
   - **All Other Sums Possible**: All integers from 1 to `n` except `k` can be formed by combining the remaining elements in `nums`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The approach handles edge cases where `k` is a power of 2 or close to a power of 2 correctly.
   - The construction ensures that all required sums are possible while avoiding the sum `k`.

Conclusion:
The given code correctly implements the logic to construct the sequence `a` as per the problem requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
