Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `idx` is 23.
   - `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 (though this value is not needed for the print statement).
   - `n` is the first integer input split from a line of input (this value is not needed for the print statement).
   - `k` must be at least 16777216.
   - `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\), with the additional element \(k + 1 + nums[23]\), and the element \(1 << idx\) (which is \(2^{23}\)) has been removed from `nums`.

2. **List `nums`:**
   - The list starts with integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\).
   - After removing \(2^{23}\), the list becomes \([2^0, 2^1, 2^2, \ldots, 2^{22}, k - 2^{23}, k + 1 + nums[23]]\).

3. **Values in `nums`:**
   - The list `nums` contains the following elements:
     - \(2^0 = 1\)
     - \(2^1 = 2\)
     - \(2^2 = 4\)
     - ...
     - \(2^{22} = 4194304\)
     - \(2^{23} = 8388608\) (removed)
     - \(k - 2^{23}\)
     - \(k + 1 + 2^{23} = k + 1 + 8388608 = k + 8388609\)

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print(*nums)` statement will print the elements of the list `nums` separated by spaces.

Given the above, the list `nums` after the removal of \(2^{23}\) and including the specified elements is:
\[ [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, k - 8388608, k + 8388609] \]

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 65536 131072 262144 524288 1048576 2097152 4194304 [k - 8388608] [k + 8388609]**
