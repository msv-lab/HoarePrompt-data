Output State: **`idx` is 23, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first integer input split from a line of input, `k` must be at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing integers from 2^0 to 2^23, and `nums[23]` is `k - 2^23`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `k - nums[idx]` to the list `nums`. Given that `idx` is 23 and `nums` originally contains integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\), the value of `nums[23]` before the operation is \(2^{23}\). Therefore, after appending `k - 2^{23}` to `nums`, the updated list `nums` will have its 24th element (index 23) set to `k - 2^{23}`. All other variables remain unchanged.
