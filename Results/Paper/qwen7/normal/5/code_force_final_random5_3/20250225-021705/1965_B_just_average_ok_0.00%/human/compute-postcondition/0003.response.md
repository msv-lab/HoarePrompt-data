Output State: **`idx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first integer input split from a line of input, `k` is the second integer input split from the same line of input, `nums` is a list containing integers from 2^0 to 2^23.**

The code initializes the variable `idx` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, or `nums`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
