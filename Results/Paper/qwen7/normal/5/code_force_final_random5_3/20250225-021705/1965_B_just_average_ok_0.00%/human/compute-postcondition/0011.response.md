Output State: `idx` is 24, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the first integer input split from a line of input, `k` must be at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing integers from 2^0 to 2^23.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `k >= 1 << idx`. Given that `1 << idx` doubles with each iteration starting from \(1 << 0 = 1\), after 24 iterations, `idx` will be 24. At this point, `1 << 24 = 16777216`, so `k` must be at least 16777216 for the loop to continue. All other variables (`t`, `n`, and `nums`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
