Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `idx` is 23.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000 (though this value is not needed for the specific print statement).
   - `n` is the first integer input split from a line of input (this value is not needed for the specific print statement).
   - `k` must be at least 16777216.
   - `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\), with the additional element \(k - 2^{23}\) and an extra element \(k + 1 + nums[23]\). Note that \(2^{23} = k - 2^{23}\), so the element at index 23 is \(k - 2^{23}\).
   - The element \(1 << idx\) (which is \(2^{23}\)) has been removed from `nums`.

2. **List Content:**
   - The list `nums` initially contains the integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\), plus the additional elements \(k - 2^{23}\) and \(k + 1 + nums[23]\).
   - Since \(2^{23} = k - 2^{23}\), the element at index 23 is \(2^{23}\).
   - After removing \(2^{23}\), the list `nums` now contains the integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{22}\), plus the additional elements \(k - 2^{23}\) and \(k + 1 + nums[23]\).

3. **Counting Elements in `nums`:**
   - There are 23 elements from \(2^0\) to \(2^{22}\).
   - There are 2 additional elements, \(k - 2^{23}\) and \(k + 1 + nums[23]\).
   - Therefore, the total number of elements in `nums` is \(23 + 2 = 25\).

Given this analysis, the length of the list `nums` after the specified removal is 25.

Output: **25**
