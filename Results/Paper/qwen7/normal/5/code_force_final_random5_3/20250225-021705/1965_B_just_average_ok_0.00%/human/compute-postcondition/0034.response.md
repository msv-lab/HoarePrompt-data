Output State: **`idx` is 24, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the new input integer from `map(int, input().split())`, `k` must be at least \(2^{25}\), `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) with `nums[23]` being `k - 2^{23}`, an additional element `k + 1 + nums[23]`, and the element \(1 \ll 23\) (which is \(2^{23}\)) has been removed from `nums`, and `nums` now contains an additional element `k - nums[24]`, and `nums` now includes the element `k + 1`, and `nums` now includes the element `k + nums[idx] + 1` which is `k + 25`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value `k + nums[idx] + 1` to the list `nums`. Given that `idx` is 24, `nums[24]` is `k - 2^{23}`, so `k + nums[idx] + 1` equals `k + (k - 2^{23}) + 1` which simplifies to `2k - 2^{23} + 1`. However, since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we express it as `k + 25`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
