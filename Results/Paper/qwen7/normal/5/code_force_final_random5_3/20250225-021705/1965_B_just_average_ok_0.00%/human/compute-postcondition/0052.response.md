Output State: **`idx` is 3, `k` must be at least 8, `nums` is a list with the last element being k + 1**.

Explanation: The code appends `k + 1` to the list `nums`. Since `k` must be at least 8, the last element of `nums` will be `k + 1`. The values of `idx` and the condition on `k` remain unchanged.
