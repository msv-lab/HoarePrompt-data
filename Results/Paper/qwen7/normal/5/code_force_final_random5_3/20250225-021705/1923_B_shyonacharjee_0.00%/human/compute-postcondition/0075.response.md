Output State: **`distance` is equal to `abs(position)`, `success` remains False, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the healths of all monsters, `i` is n-1, `bullets_needed` is the `health` of the current monster, we break out of the loop or if statement, `position` is assigned from the tuple `monsters[i]`, `health` is assigned from the tuple `monsters[i]`, `time_available` is now equal to `distance`, `healths` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` must be greater than 1, `positions` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of their positions, and the variable `success` is set to False.**

This means that the loop or if statement has been broken out of, but no other variables have been modified. The conditions and values of the other variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
