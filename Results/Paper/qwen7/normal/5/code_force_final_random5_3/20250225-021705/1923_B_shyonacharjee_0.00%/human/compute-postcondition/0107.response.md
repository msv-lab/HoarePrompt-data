Postcondition: `bullets_needed` is equal to `health`, `position` is assigned the value of `monsters[i][0]`, `health` is assigned the value of `monsters[i][1]`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, and `success` is `False`. If the total bullets used plus `bullets_needed` exceeds `time_available`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
