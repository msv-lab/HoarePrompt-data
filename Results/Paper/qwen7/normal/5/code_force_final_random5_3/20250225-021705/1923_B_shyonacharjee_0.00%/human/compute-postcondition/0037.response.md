Postcondition: `i` is 2, `bullets_needed` is `health`, `position` is `monsters[1][0]`, `health` is `monsters[1][1]`, `distance` is the absolute value of `monsters[1][0]`, `time_available` is the absolute value of `monsters[1][0]`, `total_bullets_used` is `2 * health`, and `success` is False, if `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` exceeds `time_available`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
