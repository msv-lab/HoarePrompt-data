Output State: **`monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 3â‹…10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `healths` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `positions` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code sorts the `zip` object containing pairs of `positions` and `healths` based on the absolute value of the positions. The sorting does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `healths`, or `positions`. The `monsters` variable now holds the sorted list of tuples.
