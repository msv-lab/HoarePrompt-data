Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `bullets_needed` is `health` for the last monster in the list, `position` is the position of the last monster in the list, `health` is the health of the last monster in the list, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the last monster, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the healths of all monsters, `success` is False, `healths` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` and `k` are input integers, `positions` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of their positions.**

Explanation: The code sorts the `positions` and `healths` into a single list of tuples, where each tuple contains a position and its corresponding health, sorted by the absolute value of the position. The other variables remain unchanged.
