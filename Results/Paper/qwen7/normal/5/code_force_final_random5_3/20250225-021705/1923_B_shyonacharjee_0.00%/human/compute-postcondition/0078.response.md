Output State: **`distance` is equal to `abs(position)`, `success` remains False, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the healths of all monsters plus the health of the current monster, `i` is n-1, `bullets_needed` is the `health` of the current monster.**

Explanation: The code `total_bullets_used += bullets_needed` increments the value of `total_bullets_used` by the value of `bullets_needed`. Since `bullets_needed` is the health of the current monster, `total_bullets_used` now includes the health of the current monster. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
