Output State: **`success` is True, `total_bullets_used` is 0, `i` is `n-2`, `bullets_needed` is `health` for the last monster in the list, `position` is the position of the current monster, `health` is the health of the current monster, `distance` is `abs(position)`, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the healths of all monsters, `healths` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` must be greater than 1, `positions` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of their positions.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of the variable `distance` to be the absolute value of the current monster's position (`abs(position)`). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
