Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `success` is True, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the healths of all monsters, `i` is t-1, `bullets_needed` is 0, `position` is the position of the last monster, `health` is the health of the last monster, `distance` is abs(position), `time_available` is distance, `healths` is a list of integers read from the input using `map(int, input().split())`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of their positions, `positions` is a list of integers read from the input using `map(int, input().split)`, `total_bullets_used` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    position, health = monsters[i]
    distance = abs(position)
    time_available = distance
    bullets_needed = health
    if total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available:
        success = False
        break
    total_bullets_used += bullets_needed


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `t-1`, `distance` is `abs(position)'`, `time_available` is `abs(position)'`, `bullets_needed` is `health`, `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed`, `position` and `health` are assigned the values from `monsters[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `bullets_needed` is equal to `health`, `position` is assigned the value of `monsters[i][0]`, `health` is assigned the value of `monsters[i][1]`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed`, and `success` is `False`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `bullets_needed` is equal to `health`, `position` is `monsters[i][0]`, `health` is `monsters[i][1]`, `distance` is `distance`, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used + health`, and `success` remains `False` because the loop or if statement is broken if `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
