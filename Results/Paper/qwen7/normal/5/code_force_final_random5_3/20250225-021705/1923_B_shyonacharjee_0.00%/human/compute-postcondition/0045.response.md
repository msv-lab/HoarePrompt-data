Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `bullets_needed` is `health` for the last monster in the list, `position` is the position of the last monster in the list, `health` is the health of the last monster in the list, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the last monster, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the healths of all monsters, `success` is False, `healths` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` and `k` are input integers, `positions` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code `positions = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and converts each integer to an integer type using `map(int, ...)`. These integers are then converted into a list which is assigned to the variable `positions`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
