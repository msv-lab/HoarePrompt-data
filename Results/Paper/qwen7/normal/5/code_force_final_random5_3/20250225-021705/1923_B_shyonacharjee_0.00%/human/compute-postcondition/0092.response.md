Output State: **`i` is `t-1`; `distance` is `abs(position)'; `time_available` is `abs(position)'; `position` and `health` are assigned the values from `monsters[i]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `distance` to `time_available`. Since `distance` is `abs(position)`, `time_available` becomes `abs(position)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
