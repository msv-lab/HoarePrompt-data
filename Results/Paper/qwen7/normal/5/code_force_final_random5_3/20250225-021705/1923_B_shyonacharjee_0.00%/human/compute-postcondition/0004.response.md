Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 3â‹…10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `healths` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `positions` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `positions = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)` and then creates a list of these integers. This new list is assigned to the variable `positions`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `healths` remain unchanged from their initial states.
