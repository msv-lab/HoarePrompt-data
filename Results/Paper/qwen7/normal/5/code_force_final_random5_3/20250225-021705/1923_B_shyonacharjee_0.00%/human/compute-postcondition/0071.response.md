Output State: **`distance` is equal to `abs(position)`, `success` remains False, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of the healths of all monsters, `i` is n-1, `bullets_needed` is the `health` of the current monster, `position` is assigned from the tuple `monsters[i]`, `health` is assigned from the tuple `monsters[i]`, `time_available` is now equal to `distance`, `healths` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` must be greater than 1, `positions` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of their positions, and either the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Explanation: The code calculates the `distance` as the absolute value of `position`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
