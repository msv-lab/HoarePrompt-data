Output State: **`bullets_needed` is equal to `health`, `position` is assigned the value of `monsters[i][0]`, `health` is assigned the value of `monsters[i][1]`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed`, and `success` is `False`.**

Explanation: The code `total_bullets_used += bullets_needed` increments the value of `total_bullets_used` by the value of `bullets_needed`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
