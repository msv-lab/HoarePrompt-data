Postcondition: `i` is 1, `bullets_needed` is `health`, `position` is updated to `monsters[1][0]`, `health` is updated to `monsters[1][1]`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `total_bullets_used` is `health`, and `success` is False, and if `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed` is greater than `time_available`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
