Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the positions, `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 3â‹…10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `healths` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `positions` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `total_bullets_used` is 0, `success` is True.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    position, health = monsters[i]
    distance = abs(position)
    time_available = distance
    bullets_needed = health
    if total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available:
        success = False
        break
    total_bullets_used += bullets_needed


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `bullets_needed` is `health`, `position` is its original value, `health` is its original value, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `total_bullets_used` is `health`, and `success` is False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `bullets_needed` is `health`, `position` is updated to `monsters[1][0]`, `health` is updated to `monsters[1][1]`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `total_bullets_used` is `2 * health`, and `success` is False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `bullets_needed` is `health`, `position` is `monsters[1][0]`, `health` is `monsters[1][1]`, `distance` is the absolute value of `monsters[1][0]`, `time_available` is the absolute value of `monsters[1][0]`, `total_bullets_used` is `2 * health + health`, and `success` is False.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
