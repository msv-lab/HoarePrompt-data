Output State: **`i` is 1, `bullets_needed` is `health`, `position` is updated to `monsters[1][0]`, `health` is updated to `monsters[1][1]`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `total_bullets_used` is `health`, and `success` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the `break` statement has been executed, which exits the loop or if statement it is inside, but it does not change the values of the variables `i`, `bullets_needed`, `position`, `health`, `distance`, `time_available`, `total_bullets_used`, and `success`.
