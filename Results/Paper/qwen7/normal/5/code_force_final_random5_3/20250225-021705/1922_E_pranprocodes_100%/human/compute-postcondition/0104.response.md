The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is not equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is an input integer not equal to 1. For the loop to be executed one more time, `x` must still be not equal to 1.

State: **`x` is an input integer not equal to 1; `t` is an input integer increased by 1**
