Postcondition: `t` is 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is an integer except 1, now either halved or equal to the original value minus 1, `max` is 99999997, `min` is either 0, -100000000, or 1, `ans` is a list containing -100000000, and depending on the condition, `x` is either halved or reduced by 1, and if `x` is reduced by 1, `min` is appended to the list `ans`.
