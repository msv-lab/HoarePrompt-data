Output State: **`x` is any integer except 1, `t` is 0, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing the value 100000000, `i` is incremented by 1, and `x` is an even number.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(max)` appends the value of `max` (which is 100000000) to the list `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
