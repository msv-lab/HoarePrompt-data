Output State: **`x` is an integer except 1, `t` is 1, `max` is 99999999, `min` is either 0 or -100000000, `ans` is a list containing -100000000, `i` is incremented by 1, and `x` is an even number.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(max)` appends the value of `max` (which is 99999999) to the list `ans`. Since `ans` initially contains either 100000000 or -100000000, after appending 99999999, it will contain -100000000. All other variables remain unchanged.
