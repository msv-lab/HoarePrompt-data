Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is an integer except 1, now either halved or equal to the original value minus 1, `max` is 99999997, `min` is either 0, -100000000, or 1, `ans` is a list containing -100000000, 99999998 or 99999999.**

Explanation: The value of `max` is decremented by 1, changing its value from 99999998 or 99999999 to 99999997. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
