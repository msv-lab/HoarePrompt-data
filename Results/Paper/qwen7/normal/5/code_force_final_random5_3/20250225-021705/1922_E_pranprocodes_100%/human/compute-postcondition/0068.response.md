Postcondition: `x` is an integer except 1, `t` is 1, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is either 0, -100000000, or 1, `ans` is a list containing -100000000, `i` is incremented by 1, and `x` is an even number. If `x` is divisible by 2, `x` is halved, `max` becomes 99999998, and `min` remains as either 0 or -100000000. Otherwise, `x` is set to `x - 1`, `max` remains 99999999, and `min` becomes 1.
