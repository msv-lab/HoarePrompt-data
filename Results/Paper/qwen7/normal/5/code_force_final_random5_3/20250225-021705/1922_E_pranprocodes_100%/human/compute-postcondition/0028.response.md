Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `x != 1`.
2. **Determine the current state of `x`**: According to the given information, `x` is either 0 or has been halved if it was even.
3. **Check if the loop can execute again**: For the loop to execute again, `x` must not be equal to 1.

Given that `x` is either 0 or has been halved (if it was even), let's consider the possible values of `x`:
- If `x` is 0, the loop will not execute again because 0 is not equal to 1.
- If `x` was even and has been halved, it could be any positive integer less than the original value of `x`.

Since the loop condition is `x != 1`, the only way for the loop to execute again is if `x` is an even number that has been halved and is now a positive integer less than 1 (which is impossible) or any positive integer except 1.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `x` must be an even number that has been halved and is now a positive integer less than 1, but since this is not possible, we need to ensure `x` is any positive integer except 1.

However, since `x` can only be 0 or an even number that has been halved, and 0 does not satisfy the loop condition, `x` must be an even number that has been halved and is now a positive integer less than 1, which is not possible. Thus, `x` must be an even number that has been halved and is now a positive integer greater than 1.

So, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `x` itself.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is 2, `x` is an even number that has been halved and is now a positive integer greater than 1, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999998, `ans` is a list containing either -99999999 or -100000000 depending on whether `x` was even or odd**
