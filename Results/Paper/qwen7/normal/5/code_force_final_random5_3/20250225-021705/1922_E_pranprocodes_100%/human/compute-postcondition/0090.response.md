Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `t` is the total number of iterations required to reduce `x` to 1 following the given rules, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is [], `i` is incremented by the total number of iterations (`i + t`).**

Explanation: The line `ans = []` initializes an empty list for `ans`. This operation does not affect the values of `x`, `t`, `max`, `min`, or `i`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and only `ans` is updated to an empty list.
