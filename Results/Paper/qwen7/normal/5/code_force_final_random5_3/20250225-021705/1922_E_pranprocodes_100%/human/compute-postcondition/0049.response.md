Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `x != 1`.

2. **Determine the current state**:
   - `x` is an input integer.
   - `t` is 0.
   - `max` is 100000000.
   - `min` is -100000000.
   - `ans` is an empty list.
   - `i` is `i + 1`.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `x` is not equal to 1.

4. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - The only variable involved in the loop condition is `x`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `x` must not be equal to 1.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - Since `x` is an input integer, it can take any integer value. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `x` should be any integer except 1.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to reflect that `x` is any integer except 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`x` is any integer except 1, `t` is 0, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is `i + 1`**
