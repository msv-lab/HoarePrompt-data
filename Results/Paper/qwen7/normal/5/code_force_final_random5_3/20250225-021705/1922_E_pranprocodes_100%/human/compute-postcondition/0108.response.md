Output State: **`x` is an input integer not equal to 1; `t` is an input integer increased by 1; `ans` is a list containing the function min.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(min)` appends the `min` function to the list `ans`. Since no initial value for `ans` was given, it is assumed to be an empty list before this operation. After executing the code, `ans` contains the `min` function. The values of `x` and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.
