Output State: **`t` is 0, `x` must be different from 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing `-100000000`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `min` to the list `ans`. Given that `min` is -100000000, `ans` becomes a list containing this value. All other variables remain unchanged.
