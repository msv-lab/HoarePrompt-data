Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an input integer, `max` is 100000000**

The code simply assigns the value 100000000 to the variable `max`. This does not affect the values of `t` or `x`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions of `t` being a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `x` being an input integer, while adding that `max` is now set to 100000000.
