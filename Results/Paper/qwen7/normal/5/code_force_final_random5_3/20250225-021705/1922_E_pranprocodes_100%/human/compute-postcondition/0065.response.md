Output State: **`x` is an integer except 1, `t` is 1, `max` is 99999999, `min` is either 0 or -100000000, `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000, `i` is incremented by 1, and `x` is an even number; `ans` is now a list containing `min`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `min` to the list `ans`. Since `min` is either 0 or -100000000, `ans` will now contain this value. All other variables remain unchanged.
