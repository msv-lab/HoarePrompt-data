Output State: **`x` is any integer except 1, `t` is 0, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing the value 100000000, `i` is incremented by 1, and `x` is an even number.**

Explanation: The code `max -= 1` decrements the value of `max` by 1. Since `max` was initially 100000000, after executing this line, `max` becomes 99999999. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
