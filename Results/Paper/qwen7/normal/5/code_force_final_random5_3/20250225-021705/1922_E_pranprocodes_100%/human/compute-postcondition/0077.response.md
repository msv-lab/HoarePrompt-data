Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `x` is an integer except 1, now equal to the original value minus 1, `max` is 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is 1, `ans` is a list containing -100000000, `min` is appended to the list `ans`.**

Explanation: The variable `x` is decremented by 1. Since `x` was either halved or equal to the original value minus 1, and now it is specifically equal to the original value minus 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously described states.
