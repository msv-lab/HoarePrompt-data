Output State: The value of `x` will be 1, `t` will be the total number of iterations (which is `i + t`), `ans` will be a list containing alternating values of `max` decremented and `min` incremented until `x` becomes 1, `max` will be `-100000000 - t` (since it starts at 100000000 and decreases by 1 for each even `x`), and `min` will be `100000000 + t` (since it starts at -100000000 and increases by 1 for each odd `x`).
