Reasoning:
The provided program aims to calculate the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. Let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Function `func_1(s)`**:
   - It initializes `cost` to 0.
   - It iterates through each character in the string `s`.
   - If the character is '1', it increments the count of '1's (`one`).
   - If the character is '0' and there has been at least one '1' encountered (`one > 0`), it adds `one + 1` to the `cost`.

2. **Main Program**:
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the binary string `s` and prints the result of `func_1(s)`.
   - It decrements `t` after processing each test case.

### Analysis:
- The logic in `func_1(s)` correctly identifies segments of '0's that follow sequences of '1's.
- Each segment of '0's that follows a sequence of '1's can be moved to the beginning of the string by performing a cyclic shift, which costs the length of the segment plus one.
- The sum of these costs gives the minimum total cost to sort the string.

Given the execution summary, the function indeed calculates the cost as described, and the main program correctly processes each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
