#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a binary string (a string consisting of only '0's and/or '1's) with a length between 2 and 200000.
def func_1(s):
    cost = 0
    one = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '1':
            one += 1
        elif i == '0' and one > 0:
            cost += one + 1
        
    #State: Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows: `s` is a binary string with a length between 2 and 200000, `i` is the last character of `s`. The variable `cost` is the total accumulated cost based on the rules defined in the loop. Specifically, `cost` increases by `one + 1` each time a '0' is encountered and `one` is greater than 0. The variable `one` keeps track of the number of consecutive '0's encountered before a '1' is found. Initially, `one` starts at 0 and is incremented each time a '1' is encountered. Therefore, `one` will be the count of '1's in the string `s`.
    #
    #In summary, `cost` is the sum of `(one + 1)` for every '0' that appears after a sequence of '1's, and `one` is the total count of '1's in the string `s`.
    return cost
    #The program returns the total accumulated cost `cost`, which is the sum of (one + 1) for every '0' that appears after a sequence of '1's, and `one` is the total count of '1's in the binary string `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a binary string `s` and calculates the total accumulated cost `cost`. This cost is determined by summing `(one + 1)` for every '0' that appears after a sequence of '1's in the string. Additionally, the function counts the total number of '1's in the string `s`.
