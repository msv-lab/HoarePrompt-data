Postcondition: `s` is a binary string with a length between 2 and 200000, `i` is the second character of `s`. If `i` is '1', `cost` and `one` remain unchanged. If `i` is '0' and `one` is greater than 0, then `cost` is `one + 2` and `one` remains unchanged. If `i` is '0' and `one` is not greater than 0, `cost` and `one` remain unchanged.
