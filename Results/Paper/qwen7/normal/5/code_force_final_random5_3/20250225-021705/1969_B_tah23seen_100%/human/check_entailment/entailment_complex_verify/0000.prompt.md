You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

def func_1(s):
    cost = 0
    one = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '1':
            one += 1
        elif i == '0' and one > 0:
            cost += one + 1
    return cost



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a binary string (a string consisting of only '0's and/or '1's) with a length between 2 and 200000.
def func_1(s):
    cost = 0
    one = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '1':
            one += 1
        elif i == '0' and one > 0:
            cost += one + 1
        
    #State: Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows: `s` is a binary string with a length between 2 and 200000, `i` is the last character of `s`. The variable `cost` is the total accumulated cost based on the rules defined in the loop. Specifically, `cost` increases by `one + 1` each time a '0' is encountered and `one` is greater than 0. The variable `one` keeps track of the number of consecutive '0's encountered before a '1' is found. Initially, `one` starts at 0 and is incremented each time a '1' is encountered. Therefore, `one` will be the count of '1's in the string `s`.
    #
    #In summary, `cost` is the sum of `(one + 1)` for every '0' that appears after a sequence of '1's, and `one` is the total count of '1's in the string `s`.
    return cost
    #The program returns the total accumulated cost `cost`, which is the sum of (one + 1) for every '0' that appears after a sequence of '1's, and `one` is the total count of '1's in the binary string `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a binary string `s` and calculates the total accumulated cost `cost`. This cost is determined by summing `(one + 1)` for every '0' that appears after a sequence of '1's in the string. Additionally, the function counts the total number of '1's in the string `s`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the string sorted in non-descending order. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that the minimum cost can be achieved by performing multiple cyclic shifts on different substrings, not just counting the number of zeros following the first '1'.

For example, consider the input string `101011`. The correct approach would involve identifying the positions of '1's and calculating the cost based on the distances between them. However, the current implementation simply counts the number of zeros after the first '1', which is not sufficient to find the minimum cost.

A correct solution would involve identifying the positions of '1's and calculating the cost based on the distances between them, considering all possible cyclic shifts.
