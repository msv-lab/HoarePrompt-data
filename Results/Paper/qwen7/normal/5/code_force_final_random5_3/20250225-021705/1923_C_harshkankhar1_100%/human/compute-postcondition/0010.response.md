Output State: **`a[i]` is either greater than 1 or less than or equal to 1; `x` is 1 if `a[3]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2; `b[2]` is `b[1] + x`; `b[3]` is `b[2] + x`; `i` is 3**

Explanation: The code `x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2` checks the condition `a[i] > 1`. Since `i` is 3, it checks `a[3] > 1`. Based on the initial state, `a[3]` is either greater than 1 or less than or equal to 1. If `a[3]` is greater than 1, then `x` is set to 1; otherwise, `x` is set to 2. The values of `b[2]` and `b[3]` are not affected by this line of code, so they remain as `b[2] = b[1] + x` and `b[3] = b[2] + x`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 3.
