Output State: **`a[i]` is either greater than 1 or less than or equal to 1; `x` is 1 if `a[i]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `x` based on the condition `a[i] > 1`. If `a[i]` is greater than 1, then `x` is assigned the value 1; otherwise, `x` is assigned the value 2. The initial state of `x` is not directly given, but it is derived from the condition involving `a[i]`. Therefore, the output state reflects the conditional assignment of `x` based on the value of `a[i]`.
