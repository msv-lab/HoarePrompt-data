Output State: **`a[i]` is either greater than 1 or less than or equal to 1; `x` is 1 if `a[3]` is greater than 1, otherwise `x` is 2; `b[2]` is `b[1] + x`; `b[3]` is `b[2] + x`; `i` is 3; `b[3]` is `b[2] + x`**

Explanation: The code updates `b[3]` to be `b[2] + x`. Given the initial conditions, `x` is determined by whether `a[3]` is greater than 1 (in which case `x` is 1) or not (in which case `x` is 2). Since `b[2]` is already defined as `b[1] + x`, and `i` is 3, the updated value of `b[3]` is `b[2] + x`. The other variables remain unchanged.
