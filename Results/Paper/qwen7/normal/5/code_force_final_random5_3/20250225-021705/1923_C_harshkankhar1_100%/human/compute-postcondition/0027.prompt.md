You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, each test case contains two integers n and q where 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5, an array c of length n where each element is a positive integer not exceeding 10^9, and q queries defined by pairs of integers l_i and r_i where 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `a[i]` will be either greater than 1 or less than or equal to 1 for each `i` from 1 to `n`. The variable `x` will be 1 if `a[i]` is greater than 1, otherwise it will be 2. The list `b` will be updated such that for every `i` from 1 to `n`, `b[i]` will be the sum of `b[i-1]` and `x`. Specifically, `b[i]` will be the cumulative sum of `x` values from `i=1` to `i`. The variable `i` will be `n` after the loop completes, and `b[n+1]` will be `b[n] + x` where `x` is determined by `a[n]`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations, `b[i]` will hold the total count of occurrences where `a[i]` was greater than 1 up to index `i`, and `b[n+1]` will be the final count including the last iteration.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, `q` will be 0 (since it starts as a positive integer and decreases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0), `x` and `y` will be the last pair of integers input during the loop's final iteration. The program will print 'NO' if `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or if `x == y`, otherwise it will print 'YES'. The variables `a`, `b`, and `i` will reflect their final states after all iterations, with `i` being `n` (the total number of elements in the list `a`), and `b[n+1]` being `b[n] + x` where `x` is determined by the final value of `a[n]`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after running the loop through all its iterations, `q` will be zero, and the program will make its final decision ('NO' or 'YES') based on the last inputs `x` and `y`, using the updated lists `a` and `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through a series of constraints and relationships. It takes a positive integer `t`, followed by `t` test cases. Each test case includes two integers `n` and `q` (where 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5), an array `c` of length `n` with each element being a positive integer not exceeding 10^9, and `q` queries defined by pairs of integers `l_i` and `r_i` (where 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n). For each query, it returns the sum of elements in the subarray from index `l_i` to index `r_i` in the array `c`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
