Output State: **`q` is a positive integer - 1, `x` is an input integer from the first input, `y` is an input integer from the second input.**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `x` and `y`. The initial state of `q` is a positive integer decremented by 1, which remains unchanged except for the decrement part. The values of `x` and `y` are updated to the integers provided as input.
