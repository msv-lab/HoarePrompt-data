Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the conditions for a strong password as described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the program handles the conditions:

1. **Password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits**: The program checks the password character by character and separates letters and digits into different lists. This ensures that the password contains only these characters.

2. **No digit that comes after a letter**: The program iterates through the password and checks that no digit follows a letter. If such a sequence is found, it immediately returns "NO".

3. **All digits are sorted in non-decreasing order**: After collecting all digits, the program sorts them and compares the sorted list with the original list of digits. If they do not match, it returns "NO".

4. **All letters are sorted in non-decreasing order**: Similarly, the program sorts the collected letters and compares the sorted list with the original list of letters. If they do not match, it returns "NO".

Given the test cases provided in the example, the program correctly identifies whether the password is strong or not. There are no edge cases or inputs that the program fails to handle according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
