Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop is iterating over each character `ch` in the string `password`. The only variables involved in the loop head are `ch`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the `password` string.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\).
   - `password` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
   - `letters` is a list containing characters from the password that are not digits.
   - `digits` is a list containing characters from the password that are digits.
   - If the character `ch` is a digit, `digits` now includes the character `ch`; otherwise, `ch` is appended to the `letters` list.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - After processing the previous character `ch`, the `password` string is one character shorter.
   - The variable `ch` will be the next character in the `password` string.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `password` will now be one character shorter.
   - `ch` will be the first character of the remaining `password` string.

Given this information, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes.

**State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 19\), `password` is a string of length \(n-1\) consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing characters from the password that are not digits, `digits` is a list containing characters from the password that are digits, and `ch` is the first character of the remaining `password` string.**
