Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    password = input().strip()
    print(func_1(n, password))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and password is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 1, `password` is an empty string, `letters` is a list containing all characters from the original `password` that are not digits, and `digits` is a list containing all characters from the original `password` that are digits.
    if (letters != sorted(letters)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 1, `password` is an empty string, `letters` is a list containing all characters from the original `password` that are not digits, and `digits` is a list containing all characters from the original `password` that are digits, and `letters` is sorted
    if (digits != sorted(digits)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 1, `password` is an empty string, `letters` is a list containing all characters from the original `password` that are not digits, and `digits` is a list containing all characters from the original `password` that are digits, and `letters` is sorted, and `digits` is sorted
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: Output State: The function has returned 'NO' if it found any instance where a character is alphabetic and the next character is a digit. Otherwise, the function has completed all iterations without returning anything, meaning the `password` remains unchanged and no 'NO' was returned.
    #
    #This means that either the function returned 'NO' during one of its iterations (if it found an alphabetic character followed by a digit), or it went through all characters in the `password` without finding such a pair, thus the `password` remains as it was initially, and 'NO' was never returned.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer between 1 and 20, and `password`, a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. It checks if the `password` meets specific criteria. If it finds an alphabetic character followed by a digit, or if the letters or digits within the password are not sorted, it returns 'NO'. If none of these conditions are met, it returns 'YES'.
