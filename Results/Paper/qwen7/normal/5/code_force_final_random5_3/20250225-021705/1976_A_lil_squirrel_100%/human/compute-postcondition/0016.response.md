Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for ch in password:`. The variable `ch` is the only object being iterated over in this loop.

2. **Understand the loop body behavior**: The loop body appends the character `ch` to either the `letters` list if it is not a digit or to the `digits` list if it is a digit.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - The variable `ch` changes with each iteration, but its value is not known until the loop body is executed.
   - The `password` string remains unchanged throughout the loop.
   - The `letters` and `digits` lists will have their contents updated based on the current value of `ch`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `ch` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to adjust its state.
   - After the previous iteration, `ch` was a character from the `password` string. For the next iteration, `ch` will be the next character in the `password` string.
   - The conditions for `n` (a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\)) and the lengths of `letters` and `digits` remain valid as long as the loop continues to execute correctly.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

- `ch` is the next character in the `password` string.
- `n` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\).
- `password` remains a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
- `letters` is a list containing characters from the `password` that are not digits.
- `digits` is a list containing characters from the `password` that are digits.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `ch` is the next character in the `password` string, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 20\), `password` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing characters from the `password` that are not digits, and `digits` is a list containing characters from the `password` that are digits.**
