Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 1, `password` is an empty string, `letters` is a list containing all characters from the original `password` that are not digits, and `digits` is a list containing all characters from the original `password` that are digits, and `letters` is sorted, and `digits` is sorted
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(password) - 1):
    if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
        return 'NO'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `password` is a non-empty string, and for all indices `i` in the string, either the character at index `i` is not alphabetic or the character at index `i + 1` is not a digit

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `password` is a non-empty string, and for all indices `i` in the string, either the character at index `i` is not alphabetic or the character at index `i + 1` is not a digit. If the character at index `i` is alphabetic and the character at index `i + 1` is a digit, the function returns 'NO'. Otherwise, the function continues without returning anything.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The string 'NO' is returned if the character at index `i` in `password` is an alphabet and the character at index `i + 1` is a digit. Otherwise, nothing changes.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
