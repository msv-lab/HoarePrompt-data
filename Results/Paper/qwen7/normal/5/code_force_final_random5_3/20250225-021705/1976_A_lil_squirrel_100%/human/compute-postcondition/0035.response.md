Postcondition: **`password` is a non-empty string, and for all indices `i` in the string, either the character at index `i` is not alphabetic or the character at index `i + 1` is not a digit. If the character at index `i` is alphabetic and the character at index `i + 1` is a digit, the function returns 'NO'. Otherwise, the function continues without returning anything.**
