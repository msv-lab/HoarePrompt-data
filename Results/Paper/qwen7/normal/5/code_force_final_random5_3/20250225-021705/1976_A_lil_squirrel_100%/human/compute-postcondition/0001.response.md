Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and password is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits; `letters` is an empty list; `digits` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `digits`. The variables `n`, `password`, and `letters` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `n` is still a positive integer between 1 and 20, `password` is still a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, and `letters` remains an empty list. A new empty list `digits` is created.
