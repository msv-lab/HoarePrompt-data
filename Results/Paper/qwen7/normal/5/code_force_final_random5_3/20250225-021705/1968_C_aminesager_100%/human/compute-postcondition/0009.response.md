Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (exclusive). This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `a` is updated such that the last element is now the sum of the last element and the element at index `i-1` of `T`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n`, if the loop is to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `2` (assuming it was `1` in the previous iteration).
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must remain the same and still be greater than or equal to 1.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - The variable `i` will be incremented by 1, so it becomes `2`.
   - The variable `n` remains unchanged and must still be greater than or equal to 1.
   - The variable `a` is updated based on the value of `T[i-1]`, but since we are only asked to adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we don't need to change the state of `a` unless explicitly required.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `i` is 2**
