Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is equal to `n`, `a` is a list where each element `a[i]` is the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements from `T`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.**

Explanation: The code does not change the values of `n`, `i`, or `a`. Instead, it creates a new variable `result` which is a string formed by joining the elements of the list `a` with spaces. Since `a` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements from `T`, `result` will be a string representation of these cumulative sums separated by spaces.
