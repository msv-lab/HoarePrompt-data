Output State: **`i` is `n`, `a` is updated by appending the value of `a[n - 1] + T[n - 1]` to it.**

Explanation: The code appends to list `a` the value of `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is `n`, the value appended to `a` is `a[n - 1] + T[n - 1]`. The variable `i` remains unchanged as `n`. Therefore, the updated state of `a` includes this new value.
