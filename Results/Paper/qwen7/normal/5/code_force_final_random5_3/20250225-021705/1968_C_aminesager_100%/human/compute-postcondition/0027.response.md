Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `n`
   - `a` is updated by appending the value of `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]` to it.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` until `i < n`.
   - At each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

4. **Current State Analysis:**
   - Since `i` is currently equal to `n`, the loop condition `i < n` is false, and the loop will not execute again.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop will not execute again, there is no need to change the value of `i`.
   - However, we need to ensure that the state of `a` is consistent with the loop's behavior up to the point where `i` was equal to `n-1`.

6. **Final State:**
   - `i` remains `n` because the loop does not execute again.
   - `a` is updated by appending the value of `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]` to it, which means `a` has been updated as per the loop's logic up to `i = n-1`.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is `n`, `a` is updated by appending the value of `a[n - 1] + T[n - 1]` to it.**
