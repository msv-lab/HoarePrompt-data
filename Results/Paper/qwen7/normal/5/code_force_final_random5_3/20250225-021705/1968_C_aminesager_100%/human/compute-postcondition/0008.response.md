Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `a` is updated such that the last element is now the sum of the last element and the element at index `i-1` of `T`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])` appends to the list `a` the value of the element at index `i-1` of `a` plus the corresponding element at index `i-1` of `T`. However, since the indices `i` and the values of `a` and `T` are not specified, we can only say that the last element of `a` has been updated to this new value. The precondition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 remains unchanged.
