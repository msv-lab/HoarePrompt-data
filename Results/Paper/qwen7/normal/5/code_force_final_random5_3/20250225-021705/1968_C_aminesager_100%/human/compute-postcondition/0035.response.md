Output State: **`i` is `n`, `a` is a list starting with `[1000]` and then each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element and the corresponding value from the list `T` up to `n-1`, `result` is a string containing the elements of list `a` separated by spaces, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` to the input integer, but does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the initial state of `i`, `a`, `result`, and `t` remains unchanged.
