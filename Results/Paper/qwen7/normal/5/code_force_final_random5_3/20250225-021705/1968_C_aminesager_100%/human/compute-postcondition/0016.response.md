Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `a` is a list where each element `a[i]` is the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements from `T`.
- `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.

Let's break down the steps:

1. Since `i` is equal to `n`, the loop or calculation for `a` would involve the first `n` elements of `T`.
2. Each element `a[i]` in the list `a` is the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements from `T`.

However, the exact values of `T` are not provided. Therefore, we can only describe the general form of the output.

The `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces. Since `a` is a list of cumulative sums, the elements of `a` would be the cumulative sums of the first `n` elements of `T`.

Thus, the output will be a string with the cumulative sums of the first `n` elements of `T`, separated by spaces.

Output: **a[1] a[2] a[3] ... a[n]** (where `a[i]` is the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements from `T`)
