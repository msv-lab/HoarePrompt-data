Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `a` is a list where each element `a[i]` is the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements from `T`.
- `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces.

This means that after the loop has executed for all available iterations, `a` will contain the cumulative sums of the elements in `T`, starting with 1000 as the first element, and `result` will be a space-separated string of these cumulative sums.
