Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` until `i < n`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be less than `n` initially.

3. **Check the Given States**:
   - `i` is currently equal to `n`.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a`, `result`, `t`, and `line` are not directly relevant to the loop condition.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is currently equal to `n`, the loop will not execute because the initial condition `i < n` is not satisfied.
   - To make the loop execute at least once, we need to set `i` to a value less than `n`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`. Specifically, `i` should be set to a value less than `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is less than `n`, `n` is an input integer**
