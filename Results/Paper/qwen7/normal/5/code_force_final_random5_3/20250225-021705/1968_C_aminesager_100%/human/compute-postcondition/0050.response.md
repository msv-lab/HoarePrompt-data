Output State: The loop will continue to execute until `t` becomes 0. After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be 0. For each iteration, `n` will be set to the value of an integer input, `i` will reach the value of `n`, and `a` will be a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the first `i-1` elements from the list `T`. The `result` will be a string containing the cumulative sums separated by spaces for each value of `n` processed during the loop iterations.

Since the loop runs until `t` becomes 0, the final state will have `t` as 0, and `result` will contain the cumulative sums for all the `n` values provided by the user during the loop iterations, each separated by spaces and listed sequentially.
