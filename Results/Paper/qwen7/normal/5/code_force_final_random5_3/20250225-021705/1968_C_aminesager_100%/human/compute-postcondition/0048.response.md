To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `n`, where `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the first `i-1` elements from the list `T`.
   - `result` is a string containing the cumulative sums separated by spaces.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(result)
   ```

Given these details, let's analyze the components:

- `i` is directly assigned the value of `n`.
- `a` is a list of cumulative sums. Each element in `a` is the sum of the first `i-1` elements from the list `T`. Since `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n`, the first element of `a` will be the sum of the first 0 elements (which is 0), the second element will be the sum of the first 1 element, and so on, up to the `n-1`th element which will be the sum of the first `n-1` elements.
- `result` is a string that contains the cumulative sums from `a`, separated by spaces.

Let's assume `T` is a list with elements `[t1, t2, t3, ..., tn]`. Then:

- `a[0]` = 0 (sum of first 0 elements)
- `a[1]` = t1 (sum of first 1 element)
- `a[2]` = t1 + t2 (sum of first 2 elements)
- ...
- `a[n-1]` = t1 + t2 + ... + tn-1 (sum of first n-1 elements)

So, `result` would be a string like "0 t1 t1+t2 ... t1+t2+...+tn-1".

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **"0 [t1] [t1+t2] ... [t1+t2+...+tn-1]" (where [ti] represents the i-th element of the list T)**
