Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and it must be non-zero; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500; `x` is not defined yet.**

The value of `t` is decremented by 1, making it an integer between 0 and \(10^4\) (inclusive), but since it was initially non-zero, it is now between 0 and \(10^4\) excluding 0. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and `x` is still not defined.
