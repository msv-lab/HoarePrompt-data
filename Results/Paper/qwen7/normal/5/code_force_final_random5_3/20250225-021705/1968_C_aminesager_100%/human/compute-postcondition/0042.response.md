Output State: **`i` is `i + 1` (which is less than `n`), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list with an additional element equal to `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code appends to the list `a` the value of `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`. Since `i` is `i + 1` (which is less than `n`), `i - 1` is the previous value of `i`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is an input integer. The list `a` now has one more element, which is the sum of the last element of `a` before the append operation and the corresponding element from the list `T`.
