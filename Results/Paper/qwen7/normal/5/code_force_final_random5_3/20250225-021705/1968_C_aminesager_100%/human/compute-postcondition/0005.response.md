Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive) and it must be non-zero, `n` is an input integer, `x` is not defined yet, `line` is a line of input, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `line` and converting each part to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `T = list(map(int, line.split()))` splits the string stored in `line` into parts based on spaces and converts each part to an integer. These integers are then stored in the list `T`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
