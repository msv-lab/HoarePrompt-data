Output State: **The program returns a list of two lists, where the first list contains the difficulties of the initial problems in non-increasing order, and the second list contains the expected maximum difficulties in non-increasing order.**

This means that the program sorts the first list within the input list `arr` in descending order (non-increasing) and sorts the second list in the same manner. The output is a list containing these two sorted lists.
