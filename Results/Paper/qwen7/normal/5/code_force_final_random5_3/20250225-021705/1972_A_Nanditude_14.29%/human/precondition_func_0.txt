arr is a list of two lists, where the first list contains n non-decreasing integers representing the difficulties of the initial problems (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n), and the second list contains n non-decreasing integers representing the expected maximum difficulties (b_1, b_2, ..., b_n), with 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9.
