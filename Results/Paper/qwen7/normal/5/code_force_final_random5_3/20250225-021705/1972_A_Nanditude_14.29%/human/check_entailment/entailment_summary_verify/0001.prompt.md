You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A contest contains n problems and the difficulty of the i -th problem is
expected to be at most b_i . There are already n problem proposals and the
difficulty of the i -th problem is a_i . Initially, both a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
and b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Some of the problems may be more difficult than expected, so the writers must
propose more problems. When a new problem with difficulty w is proposed, the
most difficult problem will be deleted from the contest, and the problems will
be sorted in a way that the difficulties are non-decreasing.

In other words, in each operation, you choose an integer w , insert it into
the array a , sort array a in non-decreasing order, and remove the last
element from it.

Find the minimum number of new problems to make a_i\le b_i for all i .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of problems.

The second line of each test case contains an array a of length n (1\le a_1\le
a_2\le\cdots\le a_n\le 10^9 ).

The third line of each test case contains an array b of length n (1\le b_1\le
b_2\le\cdots\le b_n\le 10^9 ).

Output

For each test case, print an integer as your answer in a new line.

Note

In the first test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

In the second test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1 and a becomes [1,4,5,6,7,8] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=2 and a becomes [1,2,4,5,6,7] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=3 and a becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

- Program:
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = 0
    i = 0
    j = 0
    while i < n and j < n:
        if b[j] < a[i]:
            a.pop(-1)
            a = a[:i] + [b[j]] + a[i + 1:]
            cnt += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            i += 1
            j += 1
    print(cnt)

def func_1(arr):
    return sorted(arr, reverse=True)



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list of two lists, where the first list contains non-decreasing integers representing the difficulties of the initial problems, and the second list contains non-decreasing integers representing the expected maximum difficulties. After sorting both lists in non-increasing order, it returns a new list of two lists with the same structure.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n`, the array `a` of existing problem difficulties, and the array `b` of expected difficulties.
   
2. **Main Logic**:
   - The program uses two pointers `i` and `j` to traverse arrays `a` and `b` respectively.
   - It iterates through the arrays, comparing elements `a[i]` and `b[j]`.
   - If `b[j] < a[i]`, it means the current problem in `a` is more difficult than expected. In this case, the program removes the last element of `a` and inserts `b[j]` at the position where `a` was sorted. This simulates the process of proposing a new problem and sorting the array again.
   - The counter `cnt` is incremented each time a new problem is proposed.
   - Both pointers `i` and `j` are incremented to move to the next elements in their respective arrays.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The problem specifies that both `a` and `b` are initially sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - The program does not need to handle any additional edge cases beyond those specified in the problem statement.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined but not used in the main logic of the program. It sorts the input array in reverse order, which is irrelevant to the problem requirements.

### Correctness Check:

- The logic for proposing new problems and updating the array `a` is correct according to the problem description.
- The use of two pointers to traverse and compare the arrays is appropriate.
- The incrementation of the counter `cnt` whenever a new problem is proposed is accurate.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
