### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `kreker` using `int(input())`.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a for loop, calling `func_1()` for each test case.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads two integers `n` and `m` using `map(int, input().split())`, which is correct for parsing space-separated integers from a single line.

3. **Logic Check**:
   - The logic inside `func_1()` checks if `n` (number of moves) is greater than or equal to `m` (desired number of cubes).
   - If `n >= m`, it prints 'Yes', indicating that it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.
   
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles all edge cases as per the problem statement. For example:
     - When `n == m`, it prints 'Yes' because he can just add `m` cubes.
     - When `n < m`, it prints 'No' because it's impossible to end up with more cubes than the total number of moves.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The output format matches the requirement, printing 'Yes' or 'No' for each test case without quotes and in any case (lowercase or uppercase).

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic check. The program assumes that Nikita can only add or remove one cube per move, but the problem does not restrict the order of adding and removing cubes. Therefore, the program should consider all possible sequences of adding and removing cubes to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Example Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
3
5 3
2 4
5 5
```

- For the first test case (`n=5`, `m=3`), the program would print 'Yes' because `5 >= 3`. However, it's possible to achieve `m=3` by adding 3 cubes and removing 2 cubes, which is within 5 moves.
- For the second test case (`n=2`, `m=4`), the program would print 'No' because `2 < 4`. However, it's possible to achieve `m=4` by adding 4 cubes and removing 0 cubes, which is within 2 moves.
- For the third test case (`n=5`, `m=5`), the program would print 'Yes' because `5 >= 5`. This is correct.

### Corrected Logic:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if the absolute difference between `n` and `m` is even. This is because every pair of moves (add and remove) cancels out to zero net change in the number of cubes. Thus, the difference must be even to ensure that the final number of cubes can be exactly `m`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if abs(n - m) % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

### Final Evaluation:
Given the corrected logic, the original assessment was inaccurate because it did not account for the possibility of adding and removing cubes in different orders. The correct approach is to check if the absolute difference between `n` and `m` is even.

**Final: False**
