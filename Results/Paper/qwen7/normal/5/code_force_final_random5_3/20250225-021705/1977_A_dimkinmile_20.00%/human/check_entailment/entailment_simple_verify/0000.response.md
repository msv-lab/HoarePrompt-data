### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step-by-step:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to determine if it is possible for Nikita to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move involves adding or removing exactly one cube.

2. **Program Code**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.
   - The function `func_1()` reads two integers `n` and `m` and checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. If true, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

3. **Annotated Code**:
   - The annotation states that the program checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and prints 'Yes' if true, otherwise 'No'.
   - This is the same logic as in the program code.

4. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it does not consider scenarios where the difference between `n` and `m` is even. It provides an example (`n = 5` and `m = 3`) where the current implementation would incorrectly print 'No', but in reality, it is possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - Let's re-evaluate the logic: The program checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. This condition is necessary but not sufficient. We need to ensure that the difference between `n` and `m` is even, as this guarantees that the number of additions and removals can balance out to result in exactly `m` cubes.
   - For example, if `n = 5` and `m = 3`, the difference is `2`, which is even. Nikita can add 3 cubes and remove 2 cubes, resulting in a tower with 3 cubes. The current implementation would indeed print 'No', but the logic should be corrected to check if the difference is even.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program needs to check if the difference between `n` and `m` is even to correctly determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
