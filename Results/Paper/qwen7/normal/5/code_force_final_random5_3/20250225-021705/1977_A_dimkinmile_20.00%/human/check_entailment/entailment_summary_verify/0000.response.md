Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires determining if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move consists of either adding or removing exactly one cube.

### Provided Program Analysis
The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`. It then compares `n` and `m` and prints 'Yes' if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, otherwise it prints 'No'.

### Function Summary Analysis
The function `func_1` processes a test case consisting of two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \) (where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 100 \)). It compares \( n \) and \( m \), and prints 'Yes' if \( n \) is greater than or equal to \( m \); otherwise, it prints 'No'. This function does not return any value but modifies the output stream by printing either 'Yes' or 'No' based on the comparison.

### Correctness Evaluation
The original assessment claims that the program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, it mentions that the current implementation would incorrectly print 'No' in scenarios where it should print 'Yes', such as when `n = 5` and `m = 3`.

However, let's consider the logic of the problem again. To have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, the net effect of the moves must be `m` cubes added. This means the number of additions minus the number of removals must equal `m`. Since each move is either adding or removing one cube, the total number of moves `n` must be at least `m` (because we need at least `m` moves to add `m` cubes, and we can also remove cubes in between).

Therefore, the condition `n >= m` is actually correct for determining if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The program correctly checks this condition and prints the appropriate response.

### Conclusion
The original assessment was inaccurate. The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **True**
