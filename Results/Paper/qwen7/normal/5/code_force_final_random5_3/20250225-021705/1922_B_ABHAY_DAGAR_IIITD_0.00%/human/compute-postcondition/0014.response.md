Postcondition: **`num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the key `x` (the second element of `num_list`) is present with its value incremented by 1. `test_cases` remains a list of tuples, `results` remains an empty list, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers with the first element removed, `n` is an input integer, `_` must be greater than 0, and `x` is the second element of `num_list`.**
