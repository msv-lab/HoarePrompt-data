Output State: The `results` list will contain the sum of all `res` values calculated for each iteration of the loop. For each iteration, `res` is computed based on the counts of each exponent value in the `num_of_lens` dictionary. Specifically, for each count `cnt` in `num_of_lens`, if `cnt` is 3 or more, the contribution to `res` is `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. If `cnt` is 2 or more, the contribution is `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`, where `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`. After all iterations, `results` will contain one element for each test case, representing the total number of unique triplets of sticks that can be formed for each set of inputs provided.

In numerical terms, `results` will be a list where each element corresponds to the sum of all valid combinations of stick lengths that meet the criteria specified in the loop for each test case.
