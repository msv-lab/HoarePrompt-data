Output State: **`total_count` is increased by the previous `cnt` value, `num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair remaining, and `res` remains unchanged if `cnt` is less than 3; otherwise, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3.**

Explanation: The code `total_count += cnt` increments `total_count` by the value of `cnt`. The value of `num_of_lens` is not affected, and its condition (having at least one key-value pair remaining) remains the same. The value of `res` is updated based on the value of `cnt` according to the given conditions, but since the exact value of `cnt` is not specified, we keep the condition intact.
