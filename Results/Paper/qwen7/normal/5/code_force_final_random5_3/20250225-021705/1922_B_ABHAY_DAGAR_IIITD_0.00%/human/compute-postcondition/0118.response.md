Output State: **`num_of_lens[x]` is set to 1, `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with one entry where key is `x` and value is 1, `total_count` is the sum of all counts from `num_of_lens` values, `cnt` has been incremented through all values in `num_of_lens`, and `x` is an element of `num_list` and `x` is not in `num_of_lens` before the current operation.**

This means that the dictionary `num_of_lens` now contains one entry where the key is the value of `x` and the value is 1. All other variables retain their previous states except for `num_of_lens`, which now includes the new entry.
