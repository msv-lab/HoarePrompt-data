Output State: **`total_count` is increased by the previous `cnt` value, `num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair remaining, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`.**

Explanation: The variable `res` is updated by adding the value of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` to its current value. The other variables, `total_count` and `num_of_lens`, remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
