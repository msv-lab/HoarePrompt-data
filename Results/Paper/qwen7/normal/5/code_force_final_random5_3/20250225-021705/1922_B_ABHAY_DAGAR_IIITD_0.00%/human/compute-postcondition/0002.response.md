Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) representing the number of sticks, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the exponents used to determine the lengths of the sticks as 2^{a_i}. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all tuples does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5; `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `_` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, and `_`) remain unchanged. The precondition that the sum of all n values across all tuples does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5 and that `_` must be greater than 0 are still valid.
