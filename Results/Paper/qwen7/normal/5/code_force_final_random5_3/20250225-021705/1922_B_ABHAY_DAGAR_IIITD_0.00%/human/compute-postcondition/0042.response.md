Output State: **`total_count` is equal to the original value of `total_count` plus the next value of `cnt`, and `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2; if `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `total_count += cnt` increments `total_count` by the current value of `cnt`. The condition for updating `res` based on the value of `cnt` remains the same, meaning if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to its current value. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged.
