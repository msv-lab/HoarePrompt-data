Postcondition: `total_count` is the original value of `total_count` plus the next value of `cnt`, and `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged. Additionally, `res` is also increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3.
