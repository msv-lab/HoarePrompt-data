Output State: **`num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers with the first element removed, `n` is an input integer, `_` must be greater than 0, and `x` is the next element in `num_list`.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `num_of_lens[x]` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
