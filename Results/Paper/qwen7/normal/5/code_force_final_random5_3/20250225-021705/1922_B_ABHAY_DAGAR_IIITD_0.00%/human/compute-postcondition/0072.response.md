Output State: **`test_cases` is decremented by 1 and is now greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element (excluding the first two elements); `x` is the third element of `num_list`; `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the count of the value `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `test_cases` is still greater than 0, `n` remains an input integer, `num_list` is still a list with at least one element excluding the first two elements, and `x` is still the third element of `num_list`.
