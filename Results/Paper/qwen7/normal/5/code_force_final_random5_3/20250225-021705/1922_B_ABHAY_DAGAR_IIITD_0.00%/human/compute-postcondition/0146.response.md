Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `cnt` from the dictionary `num_of_lens.values()`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as there are values in `num_of_lens.values()`. Each value of `cnt` will be processed in the loop body.

3. **Adjust the States Based on the Loop Body**: We need to consider how the loop body updates the states. However, since the loop body is omitted, we focus on the initial conditions and how `cnt` changes.

4. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `cnt` is an integer, and `res` is updated based on the formula provided, but the exact value of `res` is not relevant for determining the next `cnt` value. `total_count` is increased by `cnt`.

5. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `cnt` must be a valid value from `num_of_lens.values()`.

Given these points, let's determine the state adjustments:

- Since `cnt` is taken from `num_of_lens.values()`, the next `cnt` value will be the next key in the dictionary `num_of_lens`.
- `res` and `total_count` are updated within the loop body, but their exact values are not needed for determining the next `cnt` value.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `cnt` must be a valid key from `num_of_lens`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the next `cnt` value from `num_of_lens.values()`.

**State: **`cnt` is the next integer value from `num_of_lens.values()`, `res` is updated based on the previous `cnt` value, and `total_count` is increased by the previous `cnt` value**.
