Output State: **`test_cases` is decremented by 1 and is now greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element (excluding the first element); `x` is the second element of `num_list`; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that has the key-value pair `{x: 1}`.**

Explanation: The code `num_of_lens[x] = 1` sets the value of `num_of_lens[x]` to 1. This means that if `x` was already a key in `num_of_lens`, its value is now 1. If `x` was not a key before, it is added to the dictionary with a value of 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
