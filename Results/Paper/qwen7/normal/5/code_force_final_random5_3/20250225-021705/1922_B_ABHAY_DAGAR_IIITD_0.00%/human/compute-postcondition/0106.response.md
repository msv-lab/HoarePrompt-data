Output State: **All values of `num_of_lens` have been processed, `res` contains the sum of all contributions calculated according to the conditions in the loop, `total_count` is the sum of all counts from `num_of_lens` values, and `cnt` has been incremented through all values in `num_of_lens`.**

In this final state, the loop has processed all entries in `num_of_lens`. For each entry, if the count (`cnt`) is 3 or more, `res` is incremented by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. If the count is 2 or more, `res` is incremented by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. Additionally, `total_count` is incremented by each count in `num_of_lens` during each iteration of the loop. The variable `cnt` is used to track the current count being processed and will have been incremented to cover all counts in `num_of_lens` by the end of the loop.
