Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is decremented by 1 and is now greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `num_list` is an empty list; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `num_list` and its corresponding value is the count of how many times that element appeared in `num_list`; `res` is 0; `total_count` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
    if cnt >= 3:
        res += cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6
    if cnt >= 2:
        res += cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count
    total_count += cnt


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `num_of_lens` has at least one key-value pair, `cnt` is unchanged, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise `res` remains unchanged; `total_count` is increased by `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `total_count` is increased by the next value of `cnt`; `res` is either increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` or `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` depending on whether `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `total_count` is increased by the next value of `cnt`; `res` is increased by either `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` if `cnt >= 2`, or `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt >= 3`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
