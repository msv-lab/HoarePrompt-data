To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `results` is a list.
   - Each element in `results` is computed based on the counts of each exponent value in the `num_of_lens` dictionary.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - `print(result)` is used to print an element from the `results` list.

Given the information, the `results` list is constructed based on the counts of exponents in the `num_of_lens` dictionary. However, the exact content of `num_of_lens` is not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact elements of the `results` list.

Since the exact elements of `results` are not specified, we can only describe the general form of what will be printed.

Output: **result (where result is an element from the `results` list, which is constructed based on the counts of exponents in the `num_of_lens` dictionary)**
