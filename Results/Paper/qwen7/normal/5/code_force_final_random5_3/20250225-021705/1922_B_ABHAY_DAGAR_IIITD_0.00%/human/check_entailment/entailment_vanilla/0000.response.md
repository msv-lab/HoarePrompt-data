Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to count the number of ways to choose 3 sticks such that they can form a non-degenerate triangle.
2. **Triangle Inequality Rule**: For three lengths to form a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.
3. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It counts the occurrences of each stick length using `num_of_lens`.
   - The logic to calculate the number of valid triangles seems flawed:
     - The program incorrectly calculates combinations of sticks that can form triangles without considering the triangle inequality rule.
     - The formula used for counting combinations of sticks is not appropriate for this problem.
4. **Correct Approach**:
   - We need to sort the stick lengths and use a sliding window approach to check for valid triangles.
   - For each unique stick length, we should count the number of valid triplets that satisfy the triangle inequality.

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
