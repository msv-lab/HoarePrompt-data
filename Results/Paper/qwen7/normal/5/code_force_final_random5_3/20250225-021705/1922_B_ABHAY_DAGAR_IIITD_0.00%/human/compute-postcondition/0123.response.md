Output State: **`results` list now contains the value of `res`, `res` contains the sum of all contributions calculated according to the conditions in the loop, `total_count` is the sum of all counts from `num_of_lens` values, `cnt` has been incremented through all values in `num_of_lens`, `x` is the next element from `num_list`, `num_list` is the list without the last processed element, `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one entry where the key is `x` and the value is now `num_of_lens[x] + 1**, and `x` is an element of `num_list`.

Explanation: The line `num_of_lens[x] += 1` increments the count of `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
