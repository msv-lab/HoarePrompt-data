Output State: **`res` is updated to `res` plus `cnt` times (`cnt` minus 1) divided by 2 times `total_count`, provided that `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2.**

Explanation: The code updates `res` by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to its current value. Since `cnt` is an integer and the condition `cnt >= 2` is met, `res` is updated accordingly. The value of `total_count` is used in the calculation, and the updated value of `res` reflects this change.
