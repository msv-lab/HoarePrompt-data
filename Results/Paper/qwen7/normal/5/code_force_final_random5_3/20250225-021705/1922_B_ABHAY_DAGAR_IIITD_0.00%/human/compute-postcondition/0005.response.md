State: **`num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `n` is an input integer, `_` must be greater than 0, `x` is the current element in the iteration of `num_list`**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop iterates over each element in `num_list`.
2. The only variable that changes within the loop is `x`, which represents the current element being processed in `num_list`.
3. The other variables (`num_of_lens`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, and `_`) are not modified within the loop and their initial states are given.
4. Since the loop can only execute if `num_list` is not empty, `num_list` must contain at least one element.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `x`, which must be set to the first element of `num_list` for the loop to start executing. All other states remain as provided.

State: **`num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is an empty list, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers (must not be empty), `n` is an input integer, `_` must be greater than 0, `x` is the first element of `num_list`**
