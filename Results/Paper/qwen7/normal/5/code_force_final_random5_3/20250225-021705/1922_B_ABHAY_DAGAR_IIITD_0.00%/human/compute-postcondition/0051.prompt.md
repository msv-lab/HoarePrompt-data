Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `total_count` is 0, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each unique element from `num_list` is a key, and the corresponding value for each key is the count of how many times that element appeared in `num_list`, `test_cases` remains a list of tuples, `results` remains an empty list, `num_list` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, and `_` must be greater than 0; res is 0.
Code of the loop:
for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
    if cnt >= 3:
        res += cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6
    if cnt >= 2:
        res += cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count
    total_count += cnt


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `total_count' is equal to the original value of `total_count` plus `cnt', res' remains unchanged

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `total_count` is equal to the original value of `total_count` plus the next value of `cnt`, and `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2; if `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `total_count` is the original value of `total_count` plus the next value of `cnt`, and `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged. Additionally, `res` is also increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3; `total_count` is the original value of `total_count` plus the next value of `cnt`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
