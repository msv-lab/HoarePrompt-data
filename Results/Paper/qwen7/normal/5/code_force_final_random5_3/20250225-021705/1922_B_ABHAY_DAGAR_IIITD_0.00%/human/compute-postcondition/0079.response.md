Output State: **`test_cases` is decremented by 1 and is now greater than 0; `n` is an input integer; `num_list` is an empty list; `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `num_list` and its corresponding value is the count of how many times that element appeared in `num_list`; `res` is 0; `total_count` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new variable `total_count` and sets it to 0. This does not affect the values of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `total_count`.
