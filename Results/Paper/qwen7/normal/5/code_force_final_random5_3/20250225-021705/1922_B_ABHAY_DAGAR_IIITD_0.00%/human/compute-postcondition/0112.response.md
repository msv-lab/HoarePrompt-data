Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `x` and the object `num_list`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from input.
   - `x` is the variable that will take each element from `num_list` one by one.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements left in `num_list`. Therefore, the loop will start when `num_list` is not empty.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop will start when `num_list` is not empty, we need to ensure that `num_list` is non-empty.
   - The variable `x` will be the first element of `num_list` when the loop starts.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `num_list` must be a non-empty list.
- `x` must be the first element of `num_list`.

Therefore, the final state is:

**`results` list now contains the value of `res`, `res` contains the sum of all contributions calculated according to the conditions in the loop, `total_count` is the sum of all counts from `num_of_lens` values, `cnt` has been incremented through all values in `num_of_lens`, `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from input, and `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary.**

State: **`results` list now contains the value of `res`, `res` contains the sum of all contributions calculated according to the conditions in the loop, `total_count` is the sum of all counts from `num_of_lens` values, `cnt` has been incremented through all values in `num_of_lens`, `num_list` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from input, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `x` is the first element of `num_list`**
