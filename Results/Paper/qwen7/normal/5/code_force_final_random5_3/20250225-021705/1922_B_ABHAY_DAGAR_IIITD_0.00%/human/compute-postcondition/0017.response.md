Output State: **`num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the key `x` (the second element of `num_list`) is now present with its value set to 1, `test_cases` remains a list of tuples, `results` remains an empty list, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers with the first element removed, `n` is an input integer, `_` must be greater than 0, and `x` is the next element in `num_list`.**

In this output state, the dictionary `num_of_lens` has been updated such that the key `x` (which is the second element of `num_list`) is now associated with the value 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
