Output State: **`num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) representing the number of sticks, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the exponents used to determine the lengths of the sticks as 2^{a_i}. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all tuples does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5; `results` is an empty list, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `n` is an input integer, `_` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty dictionary `num_of_lens`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
