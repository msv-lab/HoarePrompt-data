Output State: **`total_count` is equal to the original value of `total_count` plus the next value of `cnt`, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.**

Explanation: The code `res += cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` updates the value of `res` by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to its current value. The value of `total_count` remains unchanged from its original value plus the next value of `cnt`. The value of `res` is updated based on the current value of `cnt` and `total_count`. The condition for updating `res` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3 is not relevant here because the code does not check the value of `cnt` before performing the addition.
