Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. The logic in the program does not account for the triangle inequality theorem, which states that for three lengths to form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
4
0 1 1 2
```

The program will output `3` because it counts the combinations of sticks with the same length, but it does not check if the sticks can actually form a triangle. In this case, the sticks with lengths \(2^0 = 1\), \(2^1 = 2\), and \(2^1 = 2\) do not satisfy the triangle inequality theorem since \(1 + 2 \not> 2\).

To fix this, the program needs to sort the lengths and check the triangle inequality condition for each combination of three sticks.
