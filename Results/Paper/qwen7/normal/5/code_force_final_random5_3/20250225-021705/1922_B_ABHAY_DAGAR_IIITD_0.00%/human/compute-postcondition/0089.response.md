Output State: **`num_of_lens` has at least one key-value pair, `cnt` is unchanged, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise `res` remains unchanged; `total_count` is increased by `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code `total_count += cnt` increments the value of `total_count` by the current value of `cnt`. The conditions related to `res` and `cnt` remain unchanged. Therefore, if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is updated according to the given formula, and if `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged. The `total_count` is updated to reflect the new value after adding `cnt`.
