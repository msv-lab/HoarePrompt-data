Output State: **`total_count` is increased by the next value of `cnt`; `res` is increased by either `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` if `cnt >= 2`, or `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` if `cnt >= 3`.**

Explanation: The code `total_count += cnt` increases the value of `total_count` by the current value of `cnt`. The value of `res` remains unchanged unless `cnt` meets the conditions specified, which are not met here since the conditions depend on the value of `cnt` and the updated `total_count` is not yet known. Therefore, the only change is to `total_count`.
