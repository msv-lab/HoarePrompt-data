Output State: The `results` list will contain the sum of all `res` values calculated for each iteration of the loop, with each `res` value being computed based on the counts of each exponent value in the `num_of_lens` dictionary for each test case. After all iterations, `results` will be a list where each element represents the total number of unique triplets of sticks that can be formed for each set of inputs provided across all iterations.

In simpler terms, the final output state will be a list where each element is the total count of unique triplets of sticks that can be formed from the given lengths for each test case, after processing all iterations of the loop.
