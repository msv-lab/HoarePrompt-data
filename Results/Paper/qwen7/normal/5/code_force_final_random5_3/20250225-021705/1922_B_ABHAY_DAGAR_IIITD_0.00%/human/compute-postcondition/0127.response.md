Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in num_list:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `num_list`.

2. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `x` is the next element from `num_list`. Since `x` is being iterated over, it will be the next element in the list `num_list` after the current iteration.
   - `num_list` is the list without the last processed element. This means that after each iteration, the last element of `num_list` is removed.

3. **Adjust the states based on the loop head**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is the next element from `num_list`, `num_list` is the list without the last processed element, and `num_of_lens[x]` is either incremented by 1 if `x` was already present or set to 1 if `x` was not present.
   - For the next iteration, `x` will be the next element in the updated `num_list`, and `num_list` will be the list without the last processed element (which is `x`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `x` will be the next element in `num_list`.
- `num_list` will be the list without the last processed element, which is `x`.

Given these points, the adjusted state is:

State: **`results` list now contains the value of `res`, `res` contains the sum of all contributions calculated according to the conditions in the loop, `total_count` is the sum of all counts from `num_of_lens` values, `cnt` has been incremented through all values in `num_of_lens`, `x` is the next element from `num_list`, `num_list` is the list without the last processed element, and `num_of_lens[x]` is either incremented by 1 if `x` was already present or set to 1 if `x` was not present, and `x` is an element of `num_list`. After the next iteration, `x` will be the next element in `num_list`, and `num_list` will be the list without the last processed element.**

However, since we are only adjusting the states of objects in the loop head, the final answer is:

State: **`results` list now contains the value of `res`, `res` contains the sum of all contributions calculated according to the conditions in the loop, `total_count` is the sum of all counts from `num_of_lens` values, `cnt` has been incremented through all values in `num_of_lens`, `x` is the next element from `num_list`, `num_list` is the list without the last processed element.**

This ensures that the loop can proceed to the next iteration with the correct state.
