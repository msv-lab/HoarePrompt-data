Based on the initial state provided:

- `num` is a positive integer.
- `n` is an integer obtained from the input split.
- `f` is now `n - 3`.
- `k` is `n - 3`.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the new input split, sorted in descending order.
- `x` is the element at index `f` in the sorted list `a`.
- The number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 3`.

The print statement is simply `print('YES')`.

Since the print statement directly outputs the string `'YES'` without referencing any of the other variables, the output will be exactly that string.

Output: **YES**
