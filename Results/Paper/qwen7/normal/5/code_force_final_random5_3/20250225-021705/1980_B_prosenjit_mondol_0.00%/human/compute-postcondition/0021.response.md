Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the number of iterations, which is determined by `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following postconditions hold:
   - `num` is a positive integer.
   - `n` is an integer obtained from the input split.
   - `f` is one less than the integer obtained from the input split (`f = n - 1`).
   - `k` is an integer obtained from the input split minus 1 (`k = int(input()) - 1`).
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split sorted in descending order.
   - `x` is the element at index `f` in the sorted list `a` (`x = a[f]`).

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the number of remaining iterations must be greater than 0. This means that the value of `int(input())` should be decremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the states**: We need to adjust the state such that the loop can continue. Specifically, we need to ensure that the number of iterations left is still a positive integer.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- The number of iterations left is now `int(input()) - 1`.
- All other variables (`num`, `n`, `f`, `k`, `a`, `x`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head and their values do not affect the loop continuation condition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`num` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer obtained from the input split, `f` is one less than the integer obtained from the input split, `k` is an integer obtained from the input split minus 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split sorted in descending order, `x` is the element at index `f` in the sorted list `a`, and the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 1`**.
