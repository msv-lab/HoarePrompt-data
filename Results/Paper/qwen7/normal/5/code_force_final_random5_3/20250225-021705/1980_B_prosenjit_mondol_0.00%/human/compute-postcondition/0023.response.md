Output State: **`num` is a positive integer, `n` is the integer obtained from the input split, `f` is now f-1 (one less than the integer obtained from the input split), `k` is the integer obtained from the input split minus 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split sorted in descending order, `x` is the element at index `f` in the sorted list `a`, and the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 1`.**

In this output state, the variable `f` has been decremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
