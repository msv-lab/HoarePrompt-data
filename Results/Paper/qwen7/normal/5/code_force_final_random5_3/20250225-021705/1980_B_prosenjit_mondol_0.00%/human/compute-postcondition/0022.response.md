Output State: **`num` is a positive integer, `n` is the integer obtained from the input split, `f` is one less than the integer obtained from the input split, `k` is the integer obtained from the input split minus 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split sorted in descending order, `x` is the element at index `f` in the sorted list `a`, and the number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 1`.**

The code `n, f, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input, splits them, and assigns them to `n`, `f`, and `k` respectively. The values of `num`, `a`, and the number of iterations left remain unchanged.
