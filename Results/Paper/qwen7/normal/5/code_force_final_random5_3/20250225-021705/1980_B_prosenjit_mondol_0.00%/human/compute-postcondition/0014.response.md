Based on the initial state provided:

- `num` is a positive integer.
- `n` is an integer obtained from the input split.
- `f` is one less than the integer obtained from the input split, so `f = n - 1`.
- `k` is an integer obtained from the input split minus 1, so `k = n - 1`.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and sorted in descending order.
- `x` is the element at index `f` in the sorted list `a`, so `x = a[f]`.
- `a[k]` is less than `x`.

The print statement is:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will simply print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
