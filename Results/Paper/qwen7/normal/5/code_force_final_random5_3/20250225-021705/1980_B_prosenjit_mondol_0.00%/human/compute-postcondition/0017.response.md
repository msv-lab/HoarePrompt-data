Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `num` is a positive integer.
   - `n` is an integer obtained from the input split.
   - `f` is one less than the integer obtained from the input split, so `f = n - 1`.
   - `k` is an integer obtained from the input split minus 1, so `k = n - 1`.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, sorted in descending order.
   - `x` is the element at index `f` in the sorted list `a`, so `x = a[f]`.
   - `a[k]` is greater than or equal to `x`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k - 1] < x else 'MAYBE')
   ```

Given the conditions:
- `k = n - 1` (since `k` is `n - 1`).
- `x = a[f]` and `f = n - 1`, so `x = a[n - 1]`.
- `a[k]` is `a[n - 1]` and it is stated that `a[k] >= x`, which means `a[n - 1] >= a[n - 1]` (this is always true).

Therefore, the condition `k == n - 1` is true, and the condition `a[k - 1] < x` simplifies to `a[n - 2] < a[n - 1]` (which is not necessarily true but does not affect the outcome since the first condition is already true).

Since the first part of the `if` statement (`k == n - 1`) is true, the entire expression evaluates to `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
