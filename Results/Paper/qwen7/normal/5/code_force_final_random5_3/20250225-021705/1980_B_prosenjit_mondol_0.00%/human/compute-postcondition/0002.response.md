Output State: **`num` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer obtained from the input split, `f` is one less than the integer obtained from the input split, and `k` is an integer obtained from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `f -= 1` decrements the value of `f` by 1. Since `n` and `k` are not affected by this operation, their values remain unchanged. The initial state of `num` being a positive integer is also unaffected. Therefore, the updated state reflects that `f` is now one less than its original value, while `num`, `n`, and `k` retain their initial conditions.
