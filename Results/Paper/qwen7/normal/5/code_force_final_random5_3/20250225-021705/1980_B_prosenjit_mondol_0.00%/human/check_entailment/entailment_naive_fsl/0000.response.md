Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the favorite cube is exactly equal to the k-th largest value but still remains in the list after the first k cubes are removed. This can happen if there are multiple cubes with the same value as the k-th largest value, and the favorite cube is one of them.

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
5 5 4
3 1 2 4 5
```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  NO
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  MAYBE
  ```

In this case, the sorted list is `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`. The favorite cube is the 5th (last) cube with the value 5. After removing the first 4 cubes, the list becomes `[1]`, and the favorite cube is not removed. However, the program outputs `MAYBE` because it checks if the k-th largest value is greater than the favorite cube's value, which is not the correct logic in this scenario.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases correctly.
