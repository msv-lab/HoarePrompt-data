Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `str` which iterates over `list1`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `list1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `list1` is a list of words from `b` that must have at least 1 word.
   - `list2` contains an element which is the integer representation of the current word in `list1`, and `list2` has appended an integer representation of `str`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `str` is iterating over `list1`, after each iteration, `str` will be the next word in `list1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `list1` must still have at least one word.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `list1` must still have at least one word.
   - `list2` will contain the integer representation of the next word in `list1` (which is `str` for the next iteration).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `list1` must have at least one word.
- `list2` will contain the integer representation of the next word in `list1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`list1` is a list of words from `b` that must have at least 1 word; `list2` contains an element which is the integer representation of the next word in `list1`**.
