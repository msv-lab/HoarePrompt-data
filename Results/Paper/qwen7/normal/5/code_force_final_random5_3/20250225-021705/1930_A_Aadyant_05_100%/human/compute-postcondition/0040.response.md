Output State: **`list1` is a list of words from `b` that must contain at least one word; `list2` is a list containing the integer representations of all words in `list1`.**

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, `list1` will still contain the same words as in the initial input string `b`. The loop appends the integer representation of each word in `list1` to `list2`. Therefore, `list2` will contain the integer representations of all the words in `list1` after the loop completes.
