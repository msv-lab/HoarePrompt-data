Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `final` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for num in range(int(n)):
    s = 0
    list2 = []
    a = input()
    list1 = []
    b = input()
    list1 = b.split()
    for str in list1:
        list2.append(int(str))
    list2.sort()
    for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
        s = s + int(list2[i])
    final.append(s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is the sum of all integers in `list2` at even indices, `list2` is a sorted list of integers, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string that must contain at least one space-separated word, `i` is equal to the last even index processed which is `len(list2) - 1`, `final` is a list containing the value of `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The final value of `s` is the original value of `s` plus the sum of the integer values of all elements in `list2` at even indices; `i` is equal to `2 * len(list2)`; `final` contains the list `[s]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is the sum of 0 and all elements at even indices of the original `list2`, `i` is the length of `list2`, `final` is a list containing the value of `s`, `list2` is a sorted list of integers that must have a length greater than or equal to twice the number of iterations (which is the length of `list2` divided by 2 rounded up).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
