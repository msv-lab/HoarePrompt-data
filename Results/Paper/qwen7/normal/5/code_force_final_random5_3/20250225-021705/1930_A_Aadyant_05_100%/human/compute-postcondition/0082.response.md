Based on the initial state provided, `final` must contain at least one element. Since no specific value or type of the element is mentioned, we can only state that `final` contains at least one element.

However, the print statement simply outputs the value of `final`. Given that `final` must contain at least one element but no specific value is provided, the most precise description we can give is that `final` contains some element(s).

Output: **final (where final contains at least one element)**
