Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `num` and `n`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `num` is initialized to 0 and will increment by 1 in each iteration.
   - `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `num < n`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000 (though this variable is not directly involved in the loop).
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
- `final` is an empty list.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1, and `num` must be less than `n`. Since `num` starts at 0, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `n` must be greater than 0.

**State:**
**`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than 0, `final` is an empty list**
