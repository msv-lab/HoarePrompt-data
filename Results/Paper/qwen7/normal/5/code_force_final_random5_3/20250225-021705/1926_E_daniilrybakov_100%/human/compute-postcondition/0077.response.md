Output State: **`t` is 5, `m` is 2, `x` is 3, `n` is now `n` // 2, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 3, and we multiply `m` by 2.**

Explanation: The code `m *= 2` multiplies the value of `m` by 2. Given that `m` was initially 1, after executing this line, `m` becomes 2. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, `s`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
