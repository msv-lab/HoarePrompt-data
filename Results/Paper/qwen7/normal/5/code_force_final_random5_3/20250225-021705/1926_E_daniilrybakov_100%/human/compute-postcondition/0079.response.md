Output State: **`t` is 5, `m` is 4, `x` is 3, `n` must be at least 1, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 3, `x` is (n + 1) // 2**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` to `(n + 1) // 2`. Since `n` is at least 1, the minimum value of `x` would be `(1 + 1) // 2 = 1`. However, without a specific value for `n`, `x` is expressed as `(n + 1) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
