Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input split by space, `k` is an integer equal to the second input split by space, `s` is 0.**

The code initializes a variable `s` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n` and `k`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial values of `n` and `k` while updating `s` to 0.
