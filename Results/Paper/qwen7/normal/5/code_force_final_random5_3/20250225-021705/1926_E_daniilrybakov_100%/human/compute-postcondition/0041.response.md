Output State: **`n` is now `n // 2`, `k` is an integer equal to the second input split by space, `s` is 0, `m` is 1, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that the program will exit the innermost loop or conditional block it was in. All other variables retain their previous values.
