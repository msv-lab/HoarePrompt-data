Output State: **`t` is 5, `m` is 10, `x` is 3, `n` is 1, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 5**.

Explanation: The code `n //= 2` divides `n` by 2 and assigns the floor division result back to `n`. Given the initial state where `n` must be non-zero and is an input integer, and considering the initial value of `n` was derived from the condition `x = (n + 1) // 2` with `x` being 2, we can deduce that `n` was initially 3. After executing `n //= 2`, `n` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
