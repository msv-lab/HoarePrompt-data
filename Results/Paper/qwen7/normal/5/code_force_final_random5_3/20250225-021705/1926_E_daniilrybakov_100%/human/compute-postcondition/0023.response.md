Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5â‹…10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s + (n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 2`, `m` is 4, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 2`**

Explanation: The code `x = (n + 1) // 2` updates the value of `x` to be `(n + 1) // 2`. This value is already included in the expression for `s`, so no further changes are needed for `s`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`) remain unchanged.
