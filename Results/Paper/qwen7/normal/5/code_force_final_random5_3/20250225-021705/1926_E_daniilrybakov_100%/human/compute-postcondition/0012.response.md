Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5â‹…10^4, `n` is now `n // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s + (n + 1) // 2`, `m` is 1, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code `s += x` increments `s` by the value of `x`. From the initial state, we know that `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`. Therefore, `s` becomes `s + (n + 1) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
