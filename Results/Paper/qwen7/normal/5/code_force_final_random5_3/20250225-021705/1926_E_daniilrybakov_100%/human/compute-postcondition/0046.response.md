The loop condition in the given `while` loop is `n`. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is set to `n // 2`. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be non-zero.

So, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
