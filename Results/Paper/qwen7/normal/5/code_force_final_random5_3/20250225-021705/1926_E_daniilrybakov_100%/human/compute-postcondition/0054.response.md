The loop condition is `while n:`. This means the loop will continue as long as `n` is non-zero.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
- `n` is now `n // 2`
- `x` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`
- `s` is increased by `x`
- `m` is doubled

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be non-zero. Since `n` is updated to `n // 2` at the end of each iteration, `n` will be zero when `n` becomes 0 or negative.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 0.

No adjustments are needed for `x`, `s`, or `m` since they are not part of the loop head condition.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
