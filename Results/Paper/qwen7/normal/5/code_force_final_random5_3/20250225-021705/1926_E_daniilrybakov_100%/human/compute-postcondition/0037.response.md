Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `while n:`. This means the loop will continue as long as `n` is non-zero.

2. **Current state before the loop**: 
   - `n` is an integer equal to the first input split by space.
   - `k` is an integer equal to the second input split by space.
   - `s` is 0.
   - `m` is 1.

3. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**: 
   - The only variable involved in the loop condition is `n`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be non-zero.

4. **Adjust the state**: 
   - Since `n` is an integer equal to the first input split by space, we need to ensure that this integer is non-zero for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that `n` is non-zero.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` is a non-zero integer equal to the first input split by space, `k` is an integer equal to the second input split by space, `s` is 0, `m` is 1**
