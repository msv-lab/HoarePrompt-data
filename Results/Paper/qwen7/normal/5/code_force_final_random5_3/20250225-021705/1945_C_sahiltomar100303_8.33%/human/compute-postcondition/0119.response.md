Output State: **`right` is incremented by 1 and is now less than `n`; either `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2` still holds true; if `s[right] == '0'`, then `tleftZero` is incremented by 1 and `trightZero` is decremented by 1; otherwise, `tleftOne` is incremented by 1 and `trightOne` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `right += 1` increments the value of `right` by 1. Given the initial postcondition that `right` is incremented by 1 and is less than `n`, after executing the code, `right` is now incremented by 1 and is still less than `n`. The condition regarding `tleftZero` and `trightOne` remains unchanged because no operations that would affect these variables are performed. The conditional updates to `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, and `trightOne` based on the value of `s[right]` also remain as they are, just with `right` updated to its new value.
