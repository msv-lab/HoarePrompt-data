Output State: **`left` is greater than 0, `leftZero` is less than `left // 2`, `rightOne` is less than `(n - left + 2) // 2`, `rightOne` is increased by 1**.

The code `rightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. Since `leftOne` was only mentioned as being decreased by 1 without an assignment, its value is not directly relevant to the final state described. All other conditions remain unchanged.
