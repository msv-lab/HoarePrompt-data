Output State: **`right` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `n`, and either `tleftZero` or `trightOne` must meet the condition `(tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2)`; `tleftZero` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `tleftZero += 1` increments the value of `tleftZero` by 1. The conditions involving `right`, `tleftZero`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, `right` is still incremented by 1 and must be less than `n`, and the condition involving `tleftZero` and `trightOne` remains the same.
