Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `rightZero` is equal to the number of '0's in the substring `s[mid:n]`, `rightOne` is equal to the number of '1's in the same substring, `trightZero` is equal to the cumulative count of '0's encountered from the start of the loop until the end, and `trightOne` is equal to the cumulative count of '1's encountered in the same period; additionally, `left` is set to `mid`.**

Explanation: The code `left = mid` simply assigns the value of `mid` to the variable `left`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `trightZero`, or `trightOne`. Therefore, these variables retain their previously calculated values from the loop. The only new information is that `left` is now set to `mid`.
