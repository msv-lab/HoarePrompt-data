Based on the initial state provided:

- `left` is 0.
- `leftZero` is the total number of zeros encountered from the right until `left` reaches 0.
- `rightZero` is the total number of zeros encountered from the right starting from `left` until `left` reaches 0.
- `rightOne` is the total number of ones encountered from the right starting from `left` until `left` reaches 0.
- `leftOne` is the total number of ones encountered from the right until `left` reaches 0.
- `right` is less than `n`.
- `mid`, `n`, `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged.
- `(abs((n + 1) // 2 - left) > abs((n + 1) // 2 - right))`

When `left` is 0, the condition `(abs((n + 1) // 2 - left) > abs((n + 1) // 2 - right))` implies that `right` must be greater than the middle index of the range `[0, n-1]`.

Given that `right` is less than `n` and the condition is true, `right` must be the index that satisfies the inequality, which means it is the index closest to the right side of the middle but still less than `n`.

Since `right` is the index that is closest to the right side of the middle and still less than `n`, and considering the condition is true, `right` will be the index that is just to the right of the middle index.

Output: **right (where right is the index just to the right of the middle index of the range [0, n-1])**
