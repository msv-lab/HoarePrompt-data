Output State: **`left` is greater than 0, `leftZero` is less than `left // 2 - 1`, `rightOne` is less than `(n - left + 2) // 2`, `rightZero` is increased by 1**.

The code `rightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. The other variables (`left`, `leftZero`, and `rightOne`) remain unchanged according to the initial state and the code provided.
