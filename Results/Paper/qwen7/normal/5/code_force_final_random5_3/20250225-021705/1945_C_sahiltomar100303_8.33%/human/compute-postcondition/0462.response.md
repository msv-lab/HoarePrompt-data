Postcondition: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or `n//2`, `rightOne` is either `n//2` or `n//2 + 1`, `rightZero` is `n - leftZero`, `leftOne` is `n - rightOne`, `right` is `n`, `tleftZero` is less than or equal to `(n - 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is less than or equal to `(n - 1 - (n - 1) // 2) // 2`, and `trightZero` is `trightZero`. The absolute difference between `left` and `(n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `right` and `(n + 1) // 2`**.
