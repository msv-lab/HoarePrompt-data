Output State: **`leftZero` is `left - 1`; `rightZero` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The initial state indicates that `leftZero` is `left - 1`, and the character at index `leftZero` in the string `s` is '0'. The code snippet increments `rightZero` by 1. Therefore, `rightZero` is increased by 1, while `leftZero` remains unchanged.
