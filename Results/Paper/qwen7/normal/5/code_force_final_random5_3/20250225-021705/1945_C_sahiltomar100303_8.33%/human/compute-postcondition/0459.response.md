Postcondition: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or `n//2`, `rightOne` is either `n//2` or `n//2 + 1`, `rightZero` is `n - leftZero`, `leftOne` is `n - rightOne`, `right` is `n`, `tleftZero` is less than or equal to `(n - 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is less than or equal to `(n - 1 - (n - 1) // 2) // 2`, and `trightZero` is `trightZero - 3` (if `s[mid + 2]` was '0') or remains `trightZero` (if `s[mid + 2]` was '1').**

This postcondition describes the state of the variables after executing the if-else block. If `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, then `trightZero` is adjusted based on the value of `s[mid + 2]`. Otherwise, `trightZero` remains unchanged.
