Output State: **`right` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `n`, and either `tleftZero` or `trightOne` must meet the condition `(tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2)`; `tleftOne` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `tleftOne += 1` increments the value of `tleftOne` by 1. The conditions involving `right`, `tleftZero`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the updated state includes the incremented value of `tleftOne`.
