Output State: **`left` is greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1, `leftZero` must be less than (left + 1) // 2, `rightOne` must be less than (n - left + 1) // 2, and the character at position `left - 1` in the string `s` is not '0'**.

Explanation: The value of `leftOne` is decremented by 1. Since `leftOne` was originally less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`, decrementing it does not violate this condition. The other conditions and the character at position `left - 1` in the string `s` remain unchanged.
