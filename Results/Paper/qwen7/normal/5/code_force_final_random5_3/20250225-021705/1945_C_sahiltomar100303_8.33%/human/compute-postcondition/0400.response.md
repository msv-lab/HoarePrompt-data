Output State: **`left` is at least 1, `leftZero` is `leftZero - 1`, `rightOne` must satisfy `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` and can either be `rightOne + 1` or remain the same.**

Explanation:
- The code `leftZero -= 1` decrements `leftZero` by 1.
- `left` must be at least 1 to satisfy the loop condition `left > 0`.
- `rightOne` must satisfy `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` and can either be `rightOne + 1` or remain the same.
