Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the road can be placed before the first house or after the last house. Specifically, the program does not check these boundary conditions properly. For example, consider the input:

```
3
000
```

The correct answer should be `0` because placing the road before the first house satisfies the condition for both sides. However, the program does not handle this case correctly and might not output `0`. This is evident from the way the program checks the boundary conditions, which is incomplete. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
