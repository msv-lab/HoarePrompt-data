Output State: **`leftOne` is 0, `leftZero` is 0, `left` is the total number of zeros encountered from the right until `left` reaches 0, `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is the total number of ones encountered from the right starting from `left` until `left` reaches 0, `right` is equal to `n` or less than `n`, `mid` is `n // 2`, `s` is the input string, `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `leftOne = 0` sets the value of `leftOne` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
