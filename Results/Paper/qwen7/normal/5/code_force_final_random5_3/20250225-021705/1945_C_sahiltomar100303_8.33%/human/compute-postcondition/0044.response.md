Output State: **`i` is initialized to `mid` and is less than `n`, and `s[i]` is not equal to '0', `rightOne` is increased by 1 (now `rightOne` is `rightOne + 1`).**

Explanation: The code `trightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged from the initial state.
