Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `rightZero` is decreased by 1, `rightOne` represents the number of '1's in the substring `s[mid:n]`, `trightZero` is now `trightZero - 1`, `trightOne` represents the cumulative counts of '1's encountered from the start of the loop until the end, `left` is now `0`, `leftMove` is `0`, `leftOne` is `0`, and `right` is `mid`, the current value of `s[right]` is '0', `tleftZero` is `tleftZero + 1`, and either `tleftZero < (mid + 1) // 2` or `trightOne < (n - mid + 1) // 2`.**

In this output state, the variable `trightZero` has been specifically updated by subtracting 1 from its previous value. All other variables retain their initial conditions or the conditions specified in the initial state, except for `trightZero` which is now `trightZero - 1`.
