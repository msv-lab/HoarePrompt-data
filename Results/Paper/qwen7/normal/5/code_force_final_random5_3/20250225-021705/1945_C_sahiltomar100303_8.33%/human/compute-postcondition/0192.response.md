Output State: **All variables remain unchanged except `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `tleftZero`, and `tleftOne`.**

After the loop completes all its iterations, the following conditions will hold:
- `leftZero` will be equal to the count of '0's in the first half of the string `s`.
- `leftOne` will be equal to the count of '1's in the first half of the string `s`.
- `tleftZero` will be equal to the cumulative count of '0's encountered up to the last iteration of the loop.
- `tleftOne` will be equal to the cumulative count of '1's encountered up to the last iteration of the loop.

The other variables (`rightZero`, `rightOne`, `right`, `n`, `s`, `mid`) remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.
