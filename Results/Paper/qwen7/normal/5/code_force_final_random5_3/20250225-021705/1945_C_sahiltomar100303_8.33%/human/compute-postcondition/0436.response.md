Output State: `left` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or `n//2`, `rightOne` is either `n//2` or `n//2 + 1`, `rightZero` is `n - leftZero`, `leftOne` is `n - rightOne`, `right` is `n`.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `right` until the condition `right < n` is no longer satisfied. Given that the loop executes exactly 3 times as per the provided output states, it implies that `right` reaches `n` after these iterations. Since the loop increments `right` by 1 each time it runs, and it runs 3 times, `right` will be `mid + 3`. However, since `mid` is the midpoint of `n`, and the loop stops when `right` reaches `n`, it means that `right` becomes `n` after the loop completes. All other variables (`left`, `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `rightOne`, `rightZero`) remain in their final states from the last iteration, which are consistent with the given conditions.
