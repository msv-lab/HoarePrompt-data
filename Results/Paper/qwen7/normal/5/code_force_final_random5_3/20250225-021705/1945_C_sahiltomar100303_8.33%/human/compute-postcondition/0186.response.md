Output State: **`i` is 2, `mid` remains at least 2, `leftZero` is increased by 1, `n`, `leftOne` are unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `leftZero += 1` increments the value of `leftZero` by 1. Since `i` is 2 and `mid` remains at least 2, these values do not change. The values of `n` and `leftOne` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
