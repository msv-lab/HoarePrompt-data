Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `rightZero` is equal to the number of '0's in the substring `s[mid:n]`, `rightOne` is equal to the number of '1's in the same substring, `trightZero` is equal to the cumulative count of '0's encountered from the start of the loop until the end, and `trightOne` is equal to the cumulative count of '1's encountered in the same period; additionally, `left` is set to `mid`, `leftMove` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `leftMove = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `leftMove`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, or `left`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous values.
