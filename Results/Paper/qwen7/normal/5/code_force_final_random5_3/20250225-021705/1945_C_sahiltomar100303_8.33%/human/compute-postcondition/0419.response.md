Postcondition: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or n//2, `rightOne` is either n//2 or n//2 + 1, `rightZero` is n - leftZero, and `leftOne` is n - rightOne; `right` is mid, `tleftZero` is either less than or greater than or equal to (mid + 1) // 2, `trightOne` is either less than or greater than or equal to (n - mid + 1) // 2 - 1, and `tleftOne` is either tleftOne or tleftOne + 1.**

This postcondition summarizes both cases of the if-else block. If `s[right] == '0'`, then `tleftZero` is less than (mid + 1) // 2 + 1 and `trightZero` is reduced by 1, otherwise `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to (mid + 1) // 2 and `tleftOne` is incremented by 1.
