Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4), an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5), and a string a of length n consisting only of '0' and '1'. For each test case, it returns a value based on the given conditions.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. It processes these parameters according to certain rules and returns a result for each test case. However, since the function definition itself does not accept any parameters, the description focuses on the nature of the input and the expected processing and output for each test case.
