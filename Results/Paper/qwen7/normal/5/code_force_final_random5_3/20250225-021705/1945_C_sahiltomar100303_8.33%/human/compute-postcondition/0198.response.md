Output State: **`leftZero` remains unchanged, `leftOne` remains unchanged, `tleftZero` remains unchanged, `tleftOne` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `mid` is defined, `n` is defined, `i` is greater than `mid` and less than or equal to `n`, `rightOne` is 1 more than its original value, and `s[i]` is not equal to '0'**.

This means that the variable `rightOne` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The condition that `i` is greater than `mid` and less than or equal to `n`, and that `s[i]` is not equal to '0', also remains true.
