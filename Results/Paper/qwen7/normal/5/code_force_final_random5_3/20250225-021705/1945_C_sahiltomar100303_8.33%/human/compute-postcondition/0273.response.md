Output State: **`right` is less than `n` and incremented by 1, `tleftZero` is less than \((\text{right} + 1) // 2\), `tleftOne` is equal to \((\text{right} + 1) // 2 + 1\)**

Explanation: The variable `tleftOne` is incremented by 1. Given the initial conditions, `tleftOne` was less than \((\text{right} + 1) // 2\). After incrementing `tleftOne` by 1, its new value is exactly \((\text{right} + 1) // 2 + 1\). The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
