Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or `n//2`, `rightOne` is either `n//2` or `n//2 + 1`, `rightZero` is `n - leftZero`, `leftOne` is `n - rightOne`, `right` is `mid + 2`, `tleftZero` is less than or equal to `(mid + 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is less than or equal to `(n - mid - 1) // 2`, `tleftOne` is `tleftOne + 1`.**

The value of `tleftOne` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
