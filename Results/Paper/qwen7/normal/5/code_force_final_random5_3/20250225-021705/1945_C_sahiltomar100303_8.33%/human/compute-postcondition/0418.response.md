Postcondition: `left` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or n//2, `rightOne` is either n//2 or n//2 + 1, `rightZero` is n - leftZero, and `leftOne` is n - rightOne; `right` is mid, `tleftZero` is either less than (mid + 1) // 2 + 1 or greater than or equal to (mid + 1) // 2, `trightOne` is either less than (n - mid + 1) // 2 or greater than or equal to (n - mid + 1) // 2 - 1, and `tleftOne` is either `tleftOne` or `tleftOne` + 1.
