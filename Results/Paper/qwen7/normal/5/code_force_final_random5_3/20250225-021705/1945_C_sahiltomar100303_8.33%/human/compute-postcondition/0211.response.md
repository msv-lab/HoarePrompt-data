Output State: **`s` is a string, `i` is an index within the string `s` such that `i + 1 < n`, `rightZero` is increased by 2 if the character at index `i` is '0', `rightOne` is increased by 3 if the character at index `i` is not '0'**.

Explanation: The code `rightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. Since the initial condition was that `rightOne` is increased by 2 if the character at index `i` is not '0', after executing the code, `rightOne` will be increased by 3 if the character at index `i` is not '0'. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
