Output State: **`left` is equal to `mid`, `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `tleftZero`, and `tleftOne` remain unchanged, `rightZero` and `trightZero` remain unchanged, `rightOne` and `trightOne` remain unchanged, `i` is equal to `n-1`, and both `mid` and `n` retain their initial values.**

Explanation: The code `left = mid` simply assigns the value of `mid` to the variable `left`. No other variables are affected. The initial values of `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `rightZero`, `trightZero`, `rightOne`, `trightOne`, `i`, `mid`, and `n` remain unchanged.
