Output State: **`right` is no longer `n`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The initial state indicates that `right` is currently `n`, and the loop continues as long as `right` is not equal to `n`. The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to `n`. This changes the value of `right` such that the loop condition is no longer met, and `right` is no longer `n`.
