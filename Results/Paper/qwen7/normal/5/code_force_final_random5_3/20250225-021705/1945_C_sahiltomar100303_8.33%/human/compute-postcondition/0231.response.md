Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify the Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is:
   ```
   while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2):
   ```

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `left` is an integer greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1.
   - `leftZero` is unchanged.
   - `rightZero` is unchanged.
   - `rightOne` is unchanged.

3. **Determine Which Variables Affect the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition depends on `left`.
   - It also depends on `leftZero` and `rightOne`.

4. **Analyze Each Variable:**
   - `left`: Since `left` was decreased by 1 in the previous iteration, it is now `left - 1`. For the loop to continue, `left` must still be greater than 0.
   - `leftZero`: The condition includes `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2`. Since `left` is now `left - 1`, the condition becomes `leftZero < ((left - 1) + 1) // 2 = left // 2`. Therefore, `leftZero` must be less than `left // 2`.
   - `rightOne`: The condition includes `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2`. Since `left` is now `left - 1`, the condition becomes `rightOne < (n - (left - 1) + 1) // 2 = (n - left + 2) // 2`. Therefore, `rightOne` must be less than `(n - left + 2) // 2`.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - `left` must be greater than 0.
   - `leftZero` must be less than `left // 2`.
   - `rightOne` must be less than `(n - left + 2) // 2`.

### Final Answer

State: **`left` is greater than 0, `leftZero` is less than `left // 2`, `rightOne` is less than `(n - left + 2) // 2`**
