Output State: **`left` is `0`, `leftZero` is either `0` or `n//2` (depending on the number of zeros encountered), `rightOne` is either `n//2` or `n//2 + 1` (depending on the number of ones encountered), `rightZero` is `n - leftZero`, and `leftOne` is `n - rightOne`; `right` is `mid`**.

Explanation: The code `right = mid` assigns the value of `mid` to the variable `right`. This assignment does not affect the values of `left`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, or `leftOne`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous values. The only change is that `right` is now set to `mid`.
