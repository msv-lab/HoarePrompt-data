Output State: `left` is 0, `leftZero` is the total number of zeros encountered from the right until `left` reaches 0, `rightZero` is the total number of zeros encountered from the right starting from `left` until `left` reaches 0, `rightOne` is the total number of ones encountered from the right starting from `left` until `left` reaches 0, and `leftOne` is the total number of ones encountered from the right until `left` reaches 0. `right` equals `n`, and `mid`, `n`, `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, `trightOne` remain unchanged.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `left` will be 0 because the loop continues as long as `left > 0`. At this point, `right` will have reached `n` since the loop increments `right` each iteration and stops when `right` is no longer less than `n`. The counters `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, and `leftOne` will reflect the counts of their respective characters ('0' and '1') encountered from the right side as the loop progresses. The variables `mid`, `n`, `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` will retain their values from the initial state since they are not modified within the loop.
