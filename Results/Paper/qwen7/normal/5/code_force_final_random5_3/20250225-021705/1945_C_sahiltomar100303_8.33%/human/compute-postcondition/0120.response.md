Output State: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `rightZero` and `rightOne` represent the number of '0's and '1's in the substring `s[mid:n]` from `mid` to the final value of `right`, `trightZero` and `trightOne` represent the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's encountered from the start of the loop until the end, `left` is `0`, `leftMove` is `0`, and `leftOne` is `0` since the loop ends without updating it further. The variable `right` equals `n`, as the loop continues incrementing `right` until it reaches `n`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` remains `n-1`, `right` is `n`, `left` stays `0`, `leftMove` stays `0`, and `leftOne` remains `0`. The counts `rightZero` and `rightOne` reflect the number of '0's and '1's in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`, while `trightZero` and `trightOne` represent the total counts of '0's and '1's encountered during the loop's execution.
