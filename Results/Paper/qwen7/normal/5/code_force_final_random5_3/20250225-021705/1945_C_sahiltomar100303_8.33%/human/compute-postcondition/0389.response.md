Output State: **`left` is `left - 1`, `leftZero` is either (`leftZero` - 1) if the character at position `left` in the string `s` is '0', or remains unchanged if it is not '0', `rightOne` is increased by 1 if the character at position `left` in the string `s` is not '0', and `rightZero` is increased by 1 if the character at position `left` in the string `s` is '0'.**

This means that the value of `left` has been decremented by 1. The conditions for updating `leftZero`, `rightOne`, and `rightZero` depend on the character at the new position `left` in the string `s`. If the character is '0', `leftZero` decreases by 1, and `rightZero` increases by 1. If the character is not '0', `rightOne` increases by 1, and `leftZero` remains unchanged.
