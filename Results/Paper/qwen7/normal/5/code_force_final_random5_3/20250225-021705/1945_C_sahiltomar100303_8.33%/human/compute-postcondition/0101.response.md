Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `rightZero` and `rightOne` represent the number of '0's and '1's in the substring `s[mid:n]`, respectively, `trightZero` and `trightOne` represent the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's encountered from the start of the loop until the end, `left` is now `0`, `leftMove` is `0`, and `leftOne` is either `0` or `1` depending on whether `s[right]` is '0' or '1'. `right` is `mid`, and either `tleftZero < (mid + 1) // 2` or `trightOne < (n - mid + 1) // 2` remains true.
