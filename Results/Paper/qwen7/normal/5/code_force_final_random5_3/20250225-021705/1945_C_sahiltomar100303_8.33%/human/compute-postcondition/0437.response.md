Output State: `left` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or `n//2`, `rightOne` is either `n//2` or `n//2 + 1`, `rightZero` is `n - leftZero`, `leftOne` is `n - rightOne`, `right` is `n`, `tleftZero` is less than or equal to `(n - 1) // 2`, `trightOne` is less than or equal to `(n - 1 - (n - 1) // 2) // 2`, and `trightZero` is `trightZero - 3` (if `s[mid + 2]` was '0') or remains `trightZero` (if `s[mid + 2]` was '1').

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `right` until the condition `right < n and (tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2)` is no longer satisfied. Given that the loop executed 3 times, it means `right` has been incremented to `n`. During each iteration, `tleftZero` decreases by 1 for every '0' encountered, and `trightOne` decreases by 1 for every '1' encountered. After 3 iterations, `tleftZero` will be less than or equal to `(n - 1) // 2` and `trightOne` will be less than or equal to `(n - 1 - (n - 1) // 2) // 2`. The exact value of `trightZero` depends on whether the third character added to `right` was '0', reducing `trightZero` by 1, or '1', leaving it unchanged.
