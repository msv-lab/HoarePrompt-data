Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(mid)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `mid`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `mid` is greater than 1.
   - If `s[1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is increased by 2; otherwise, `leftOne` is set to 2.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < mid`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - For the loop to execute, `mid` must still be greater than 1.

5. **Consider the loop body effects**:
   - The loop body is omitted, but it affects the state based on the value of `s[1]`.
   - If `s[1]` is '0', `leftZero` is increased by 2.
   - Otherwise, `leftOne` is set to 2.

Since the loop body is omitted, we cannot directly infer changes to `leftZero` or `leftOne` from the given information. However, we know that these values were updated in the previous iteration based on the condition `s[1]`.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be 2 (since it starts from 1 and increments by 1).
   - `mid` must still be greater than 1.
   - `leftZero` and `leftOne` retain their values from the previous iteration unless explicitly stated otherwise.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `mid` must be greater than 1, if `s[1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is increased by 2, otherwise `leftOne` is set to 2**.
