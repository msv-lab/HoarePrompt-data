Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` is initialized to `mid` and increments by 1 with each iteration.
   - The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.

2. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is initialized to `mid` and is less than `n`.
   - If `s[i]` equals '0', then `rightZero` is incremented by 1.
   - Otherwise, if `s[i]` does not equal '0', then `rightOne` is incremented by 1.

3. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `mid + k` where `k` is the number of iterations completed.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be `mid + (k + 1)` in the next iteration.

4. **Update the States:**
   - `i` will be `mid + 1` (since it starts at `mid` and increments by 1).
   - `rightZero` and `rightOne` remain unchanged unless `s[mid + 1]` is '0' or '1' respectively.

Given these points, the updated states for the next iteration are:

State: **`i` is `mid + 1`, `rightZero` is incremented by 1 if `s[mid + 1]` is '0', `rightOne` is incremented by 1 if `s[mid + 1]` is '1', and `n` remains the same.**

However, since the problem only asks for the states to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we focus on the key variables `i` and `n`.

Final Answer:
State: **`i` is `mid + 1`, `n` must be greater than `mid + 1`**
