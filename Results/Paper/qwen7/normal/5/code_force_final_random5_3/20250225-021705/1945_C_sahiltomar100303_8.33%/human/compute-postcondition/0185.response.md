Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(mid):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `mid`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < mid`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `mid` must be at least 2.

3. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 2.
   - Since `mid` must be at least 2, it remains unchanged.

4. **Consider Other Variables:**
   - `n`, `leftZero`, and `leftOne` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted based on the loop execution alone.

5. **Formulate the New State:**
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `mid` remains at least 2.
   - `n`, `leftZero`, and `leftOne` are not adjusted based on the loop head.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 2, `mid` must be at least 2**
