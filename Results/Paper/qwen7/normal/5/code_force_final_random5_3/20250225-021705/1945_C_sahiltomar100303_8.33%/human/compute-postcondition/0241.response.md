Output State: **`left` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` is now (`leftZero` - 1), `rightOne` must be less than (n - left + 1) // 2, `rightZero` is increased by 1.**

The code `rightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. The conditions and values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `left` must still be greater than 0, `leftZero` is updated to (`leftZero` - 1), and `rightOne` must still be less than (n - left + 1) // 2.
