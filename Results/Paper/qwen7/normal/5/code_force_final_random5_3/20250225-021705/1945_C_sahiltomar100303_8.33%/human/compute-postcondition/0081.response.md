Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-2` or `n-1`, `rightZero` and `rightOne` must satisfy the condition `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2`, `trightZero` and `trightOne` represent the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's encountered from the start of the loop until the end, `left` is now `mid-2` and must be greater than 0, `leftMove` is 0, `leftOne` is decreased by 1, and `rightZero` or `rightOne` is increased by 1 depending on whether `s[left - 1]` is '0' or '1'.**

Explanation: The code `left -= 1` decrements the value of `left` by 1. Since `left` was previously `mid-1`, it now becomes `mid-2`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged as per the initial state description.
