Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` (which should be `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively).

2. **Promotion Price Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `d` as `c / 2`, which is supposed to represent the price per yogurt when bought in pairs under the promotion.
   - This calculation is correct.

3. **Comparison and Output**:
   - The program compares `a * b` (the cost of buying all yogurts at the regular price) with `a * d` (the cost of buying all yogurts at the promotion price).
   - If `a * b` is less than `a * d`, it prints `a * b`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `round(a * d)`.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Promotion Price Calculation**:
   - The variable `c` in the code represents `b` (the price for two yogurts), not `n` (the number of yogurts).
   - Therefore, `d = c / 2` should be `d = b / 2`.

2. **Rounding Issue**:
   - The program uses `round(a * d)` to round the result of the promotion price calculation.
   - However, since `d` is already a floating-point division (`b / 2`), rounding might not always give the minimum cost. For example, if `b / 2` results in a non-integer value, rounding might lead to an incorrect minimum cost.

### Corrected Program:

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        d = b / 2
        total_cost_regular = n * a
        total_cost_promotion = (n // 2) * b + (n % 2) * a
        print(min(total_cost_regular, total_cost_promotion))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - Reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - Iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Promotion Price Calculation**:
   - Calculates `d` as `b / 2`, which is the price for one yogurt when bought in pairs under the promotion.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - `total_cost_regular` calculates the cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price.
   - `total_cost_promotion` calculates the cost if the maximum number of yogurts are bought at the promotion price, and any remaining yogurts are bought at the regular price.

4. **Output**:
   - Prints the minimum of the two calculated costs.

### Conclusion:

The original program has issues with the promotion price calculation and rounding. The corrected program addresses these issues and should provide the correct output.

**Correctness: False**
