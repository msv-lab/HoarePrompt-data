Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input, `d` is equal to `c / 2`, and `a * b` is greater than or equal to `a * d`.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively. After this assignment, the condition `if a * b < a * d:` is checked. Since the condition is not met (it's stated that otherwise no changes are made to the variables when `a * b` is greater than or equal to `a * d`), the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` retain their newly assigned values. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
