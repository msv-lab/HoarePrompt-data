Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for buying the yogurts. The logic used to compare `a * b` (cost without promotion) with `a * d` (cost with promotion) is flawed. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Promotion Cost**: 
   - The variable `d` is assigned `c / 2`, which is the price for one yogurt under the promotion.
   - However, the cost for `a` yogurts using the promotion should be calculated based on how many pairs of yogurts can be bought and any remaining single yogurts.

2. **Logic Flaw**:
   - The program compares the total cost of buying all yogurts at the regular price (`a * b`) with the cost of buying as many pairs as possible at the promotion price and then buying the remaining yogurts individually.
   - The comparison `if a * b < a * d:` is not sufficient because it doesn't account for the optimal way to use the promotion.

### Correct Solution:
To find the minimum cost, we should:
- Calculate how many pairs of yogurts can be bought.
- Calculate the remaining single yogurts after buying as many pairs as possible.
- Compute the total cost based on these quantities.

Hereâ€™s the corrected code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (n_yogurts, price_per_yogurt, price_for_two) = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the number of pairs that can be bought
        num_pairs = n_yogurts // 2
        # Calculate the remaining single yogurts
        remaining_single_yogurts = n_yogurts % 2
        
        # Calculate the total cost
        total_cost = num_pairs * price_for_two + remaining_single_yogurts * price_per_yogurt
        
        print(total_cost)

func()
```

This solution correctly calculates the minimum cost by considering both the promotion and the individual prices.
