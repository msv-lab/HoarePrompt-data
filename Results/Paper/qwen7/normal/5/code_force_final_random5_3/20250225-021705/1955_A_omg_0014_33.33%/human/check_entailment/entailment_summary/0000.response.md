Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the minimum cost for buying \(n\) yogurts with the option to buy them at the regular price or the promotional price.
2. The provided program has a few issues:
   - The variable `c` is used in the calculation, but `c` is never defined in the context of the problem. The correct variable should be `b`.
   - The program compares \(a \times b\) (regular price for one yogurt) with \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\) (promotional price for two yogurts), which is incorrect. It should compare the total cost of buying \(n\) yogurts at the regular price with the total cost of buying \(n\) yogurts using the promotion as much as possible.
3. The logic should be:
   - Calculate how many pairs of yogurts can be bought at the promotion price.
   - Calculate the remaining single yogurts that need to be bought at the regular price.
   - Sum up the costs accordingly.

Given these points, the provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic required to find the minimum cost.

Correctness: **False**
