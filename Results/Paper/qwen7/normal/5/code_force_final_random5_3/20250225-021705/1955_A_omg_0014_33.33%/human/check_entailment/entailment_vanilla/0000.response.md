Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` where:
     - `a` is the number of yogurts Maxim wants to buy.
     - `b` is the price for one yogurt.
     - `c` is the price for two yogurts on promotion.

2. **Calculating Promotion Price per Yogurt:**
   - The program calculates `d` as `c / 2`. This value represents the price of one yogurt when bought as part of a promotion.

3. **Comparing Prices:**
   - The program checks if buying each yogurt individually (`a * b`) is cheaper than buying them in pairs with the promotion (`a * d`).
   - If `a * b` is less than `a * d`, it prints `a * b`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `round(a * d)`.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `d`:**
   - The variable `d` is calculated as `c / 2`, which means it represents the price of one yogurt if two yogurts are bought at the promotion price.
   - However, the logic should be checking whether buying pairs of yogurts is cheaper than buying individual yogurts, not just comparing the price of one yogurt from the promotion to the regular price.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Promotion:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the scenario where buying in pairs is cheaper.
   - It should calculate how many pairs can be bought and then account for any remaining individual yogurts.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve this problem, we need to:
1. Calculate the total cost if all yogurts are bought individually.
2. Calculate the total cost if as many pairs as possible are bought under the promotion.
3. Calculate the cost of any remaining individual yogurts.
4. Compare the total costs and output the minimum.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the cost if all yogurts are bought individually
        cost_individual = a * b
        
        # Calculate the cost if as many pairs as possible are bought under the promotion
        pairs = a // 2
        remaining = a % 2
        cost_promotion = pairs * c + remaining * b
        
        # Output the minimum cost
        print(min(cost_individual, cost_promotion))
```

### Conclusion:

The original program has logical errors and does not correctly implement the solution. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
