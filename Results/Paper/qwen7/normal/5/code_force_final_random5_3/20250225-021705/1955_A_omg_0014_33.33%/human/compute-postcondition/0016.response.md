Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input, `d` is equal to `c / 2`, and `d` is now set to `c / 2`.** 

This postcondition remains the same for both the if and else parts since neither part changes the values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `c`, or `d` beyond setting `d` to `c / 2`. Therefore, the overall postcondition does not change regardless of whether the if condition is met or not.
