Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer that was initially provided and must be greater than 0, i is equal to n - 1 (after all iterations of the loop), a, b, and c are integers obtained from the input split during each iteration, d is equal to c / 2 for each iteration, and the loop has printed either a * b or round(a * d) for each iteration based on the condition a * b < a * d.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains within the specified range, `n` retains the value it had before the loop started, `i` will be `n - 1` because the loop increments `i` from 0 to `n-1`, and the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` will reflect the most recent inputs processed during the last iteration of the loop. The loop's output will consist of the results of the comparisons `a * b` vs. `round(a * d)` for each of the `n` iterations.
