Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input, `d` is equal to `c / 2`.**

Explanation: The code `d = c / 2` simply assigns the value of `c / 2` to `d`. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions except for the updated value of `d`.
