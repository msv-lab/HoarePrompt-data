Output State: `pos` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n-1`.

Explanation: The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`. After the loop has executed all its iterations, the final value of `i` will be `n-1`. Since the loop updates `pos` only when it finds an element in `arr` that equals `k`, and given that the loop has completed all iterations, `pos` will be set to the index where `k` was found, or remain 0 if `k` was not found in any of the elements of `arr`. In the provided output states, `pos` is incremented each time the condition `arr[i] == k` is met and the loop has not yet reached its last iteration. Therefore, after all iterations, `pos` will be the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or 0 if `k` does not appear in `arr`. The variable `n` must remain greater than 0, and `i` will be `n-1` after the loop completes.
