Postcondition: `pos` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `low` is either 0 or `mid`, `high` is either `mid` or greater than 1, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2` and is added to set `st`, and depending on the value of `arr[mid]`, if `arr[mid]` is greater than `k`, `high` is set to `mid`; otherwise, `low` is set to `mid` and `arr[mid]` is less than or equal to `k`.
