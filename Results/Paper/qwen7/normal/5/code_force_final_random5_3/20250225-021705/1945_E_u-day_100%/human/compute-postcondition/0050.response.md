Based on the initial state provided:

- `pos` is 2.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is equal to `n-1`.
- `low` and `high` are such that `low + 1 < high`.
- `mid` is added to set `st` multiple times.
- `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2` in each iteration until the final search range cannot be further narrowed.
- `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.

The print statement is simply `print(1)`. This means it will print the integer 1 directly.

Output: **1**
