You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and arr is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n representing the permutation.
def func_3():
    n, k = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
        
    #State: Output State: `pos` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n-1`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`. After the loop has executed all its iterations, the final value of `i` will be `n-1`. Since the loop updates `pos` only when it finds an element in `arr` that equals `k`, and given that the loop has completed all iterations, `pos` will be set to the index where `k` was found, or remain 0 if `k` was not found in any of the elements of `arr`. In the provided output states, `pos` is incremented each time the condition `arr[i] == k` is met and the loop has not yet reached its last iteration. Therefore, after all iterations, `pos` will be the index of the last occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or 0 if `k` does not appear in `arr`. The variable `n` must remain greater than 0, and `i` will be `n-1` after the loop completes.
    low, high = 0, n
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        st.add(mid)
        
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State: `pos` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `low` and `high` are such that `low + 1 < high`, `mid` is added to set `st` multiple times, and `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2` in each iteration until the final search range cannot be further narrowed.
    if (arr[low] == k) :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    else :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        #This is printed: 2 3
    #State: Postcondition: `pos` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `low` and `high` are such that `low + 1 < high`, `mid` is added to set `st` multiple times, and `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2` in each iteration until the final search range cannot be further narrowed. Additionally, `arr[low]` is either equal to `k` or not equal to `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: n (a positive integer representing the length of the permutation), k (an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n), and arr (a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n representing the permutation). The function returns an element from the list arr at index k-1.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
