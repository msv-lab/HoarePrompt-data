Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `pos` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `i` is 0
   - If `arr[i] == k`, the condition is met; otherwise, `pos`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `i = 1`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged because the loop condition depends on `i` being less than `n`, and `n` does not change within the loop.
   - The value of `pos` remains unchanged because the condition `arr[i] == k` was not met (since `i` was 0 and the condition is only checked if `arr[i] == k`), and thus `pos` stays at 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`pos` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1**
