Output State: **`pos` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`**.

Explanation: The code initializes two new variables, `low` and `high`, with the values `0` and `n`, respectively. These variables are used to define the search range within the array `arr` during a binary search. The values of `pos`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states because the code does not modify them. Therefore, `pos` is still 2, `n` is still greater than 0, `i` is still equal to `n-1`, and `low` and `high` are now initialized to 0 and `n`, respectively.
