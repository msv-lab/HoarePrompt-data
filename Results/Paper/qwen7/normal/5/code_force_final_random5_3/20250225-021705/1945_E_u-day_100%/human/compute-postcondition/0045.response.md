Postcondition: `pos` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `low` is such that `arr[low]` equals `k`, `high` is such that `low + 1 < high`, `mid` is added to set `st` multiple times, and `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2` in each iteration until the final search range cannot be further narrowed.
