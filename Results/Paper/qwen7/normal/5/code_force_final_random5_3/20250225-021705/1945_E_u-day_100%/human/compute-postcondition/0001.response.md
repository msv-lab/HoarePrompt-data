Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the result of the function `func_2()` to the variable `arr`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they were set by the function `func_1()`. Therefore, `n` and `k` retain their initial states, and `arr` is updated to the result of `func_2()`.
