Output State: **`pos` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `low` is either 0 or `mid`, `high` is either `mid` or greater than `low + 1`, `mid` is added to set `st`, `arr[mid]` is either greater than `k` or less than or equal to `k`, `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2, `mid` is added to set `st`.**

Explanation: The line `st.add(mid)` adds the current value of `mid` to the set `st`. Since no other changes are made to the variables, their values remain the same as before the execution of this line of code. Therefore, the only change is that `mid` is now also in the set `st`.
