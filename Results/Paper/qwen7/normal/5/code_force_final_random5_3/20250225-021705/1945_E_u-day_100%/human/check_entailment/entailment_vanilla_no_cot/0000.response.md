Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the required functionality. The task requires rearranging the permutation with at most two swaps so that the element `x` is at the `l`-th position after performing a binary search. However, the current implementation does not attempt to rearrange the array; instead, it performs a binary search directly on the given array and prints the index of the target value if found. Additionally, it only prints `0` if the target is found at the `low` index without considering the possibility of rearranging the array through swaps. 

To fix this, the solution should identify the correct positions for the swaps to ensure that the element `x` is at the `l`-th position after the binary search.
