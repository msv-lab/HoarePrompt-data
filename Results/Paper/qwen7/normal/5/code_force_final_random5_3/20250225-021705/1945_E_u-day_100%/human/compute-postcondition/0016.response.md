Output State: `pos` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, and `i` is `n-1`.

Explanation: The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`. After the loop has executed all its iterations, the final value of `i` will be `n-1`. According to the given conditions, `pos` is updated to the index where `arr[i] == k` is found. If such an index is found within the range of the loop, `pos` will be set to that index. Since the loop has completed all its iterations, the maximum value `i` can take is `n-1`, and `pos` will be set to the index where `k` was found, which is 2 based on the given states after the first three iterations. If `k` was not found in the array, `pos` would remain -1, but since we know it was found at some point (as per the given states), `pos` will be the last index where `k` was found, which is 2.
