Output State: **`pos` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `low` is 0, `high` is greater than 1, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the midpoint `mid` using the formula `(low + high) // 2`. Since `low` is 0 and `high` must be greater than 1, `mid` will be `(0 + high) // 2`. However, the exact value of `mid` cannot be determined without knowing the specific value of `high`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
