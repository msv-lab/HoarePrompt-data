Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `pos` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `st` is an empty set.
Code of the loop:
while low + 1 < high:
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    st.add(mid)
    if arr[mid] > k:
        high = mid
    else:
        low = mid


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `pos` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `low` is either 0 or `mid`, `high` is either `mid` or greater than 1, `mid` is added to set `st`, and `arr[mid]` is either greater than `k` or less than or equal to `k`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `pos` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `low` and `high` are updated based on the value of `arr[mid]` relative to `k`, `mid` is added to set `st` twice, `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`, and `mid` is added to set `st` again.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `pos` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `low` and `high` are updated based on the value of `arr[mid]` relative to `k`, `mid` is added to set `st` three times, `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`, and `low + 1 < high` must hold true; `mid` is reassigned to the value of `(low + high) // 2. This means that after executing the if-else block, `pos` remains 2, `n` stays greater than 0, `i` is still `n-1`, and the search range for `k` is narrowed down by updating `low` and `high` accordingly, while `mid` is updated and added to the set `st` three times.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
