Output State: **`pos` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `low` is either 0 or `mid`, `high` is equal to `mid`, `mid` is added to set `st`, `arr[mid]` is either greater than `k` or less than or equal to `k`, `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2, `mid` is added to set `st`.**

Explanation: The code `high = mid` simply assigns the current value of `mid` to `high`. All other variables and their relationships remain unchanged from the initial state.
