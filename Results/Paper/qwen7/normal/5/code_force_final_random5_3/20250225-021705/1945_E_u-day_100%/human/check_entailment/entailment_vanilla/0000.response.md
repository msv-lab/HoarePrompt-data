Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
- We need to find the position of `x` in the permutation `p`.
- We are allowed to perform at most 2 swaps to make the binary search work correctly.
- After performing the swaps, we should have `p[l] == x` where `l` is the index returned by the binary search.

### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Function Definitions**:
   - `func_1()` reads a line of input and splits it into integers using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - `func_2()` converts the result of `func_1()` into a list.
   - `func_3()` is supposed to implement the logic to solve the problem.

2. **Function 3 Implementation**:
   - `n, k = func_1()`: Reads the length of the permutation `n` and the target value `k`.
   - `arr = func_2()`: Converts the input into a list `arr`.
   - `pos = -1`: Initializes the position of `k` in the list.
   - `for i in range(n):`: Iterates through the list to find the position of `k`.
     - If `arr[i] == k`, sets `pos = i`.
   - `(low, high) = (0, n)`: Initializes the binary search bounds.
   - `st = set()`: Initializes an empty set (not used in the rest of the code).
   - `while low + 1 < high:`: Runs the binary search loop.
     - `mid = (low + high) // 2`: Calculates the middle index.
     - `st.add(mid)`: Adds the middle index to the set (not used).
     - Checks if `arr[mid] > k` and adjusts `high` or `low` accordingly.
   - `if arr[low] == k:`: Checks if the element at `low` is `k`.
     - If true, prints `0` (indicating no swaps needed).
   - `else:`: If the element at `low` is not `k`, prints `1` and performs a swap.
     - `print(low + 1, pos + 1)`: Swaps the elements at `low` and `pos`.

### Issues in the Given Program:
1. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search logic is implemented incorrectly. The `st` set is not used and the condition `low + 1 < high` is not appropriate for binary search.
   - The binary search should be focused on finding the correct position of `k` directly without additional conditions.

2. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The swapping logic is only performed once, which might not be sufficient to make the binary search work correctly.
   - The program assumes that one swap is enough, but the problem statement guarantees that two swaps are always sufficient.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program outputs `0` if no swaps are needed, which is correct.
   - The program outputs `1` followed by the indices of the swap, but it should handle the case where two swaps are needed.

### Corrected Program:
To fix these issues, we need to:
- Correctly implement the binary search to find the position of `k`.
- Ensure that the swaps are performed correctly to make the binary search work.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_3():
    (n, k) = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
    if pos == -1:
        print("No such element")
        return
    low, high = 0, n
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] <= k:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid
    if arr[low] == k:
        print(0)
    else:
        # Find the correct position
        correct_pos = -1
        for i in range(n):
            if arr[i] == k:
                correct_pos = i
                break
        # Perform swaps
        if low != correct_pos:
            print(1)
            print(low + 1, correct_pos + 1)
        else:
            print(0)

# Main execution
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_3()
```

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect due to the misimplementation of the binary search and the swapping logic. The corrected program should be able to handle the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
