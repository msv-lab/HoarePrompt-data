Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `low + 1 < high`.
2. **Current values**:
   - `low` is 0.
   - `high` is `n`.
3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `low + 1` must be less than `high`.
   - Given `low` is 0, the condition becomes `0 + 1 < high`, which simplifies to `1 < high`.

4. **Check the current state**:
   - `low` is 0 (which is fixed).
   - `high` is `n` (and `n` is greater than 0).

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `low` is fixed at 0, we need to ensure that `high` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `high` being greater than 1.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`pos` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `low` is 0, `high` must be greater than 1, `st` is an empty set**
