Output State: The `arr` list will be empty, and `freq` will be a dictionary containing the count of each unique stick length from the original list. Specifically, for every unique length `n` in the original `arr`, `freq[n]` will be the total number of times `n` appeared in `arr`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `freq` will have an entry for each distinct stick length found in the initial `arr`, with the value being the frequency of that stick length. The `arr` list will be empty because all elements have been processed and moved into the `freq` dictionary.
