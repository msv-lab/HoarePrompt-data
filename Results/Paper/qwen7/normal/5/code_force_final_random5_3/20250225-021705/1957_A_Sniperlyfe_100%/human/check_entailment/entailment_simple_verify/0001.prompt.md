You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    return sum((v // 3 for v in freq.values()))



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer represents the length of a stick, and the length of the list is the number of sticks available (1 <= n <= 100). Each stick length is a positive integer not exceeding 100.
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: Output State: The `arr` list will be empty, and `freq` will be a dictionary containing the count of each unique stick length from the original list. Specifically, for every unique length `n` in the original `arr`, `freq[n]` will be the total number of times `n` appeared in `arr`.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop, `freq` will have an entry for each distinct stick length found in the initial `arr`, with the value being the frequency of that stick length. The `arr` list will be empty because all elements have been processed and moved into the `freq` dictionary.
    return sum(v // 3 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the `freq` dictionary by 3.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's reason through the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the lengths of the sticks.
   
2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1(arr)` is defined to process the list of stick lengths.
   - Inside `func_1`, a dictionary `freq` is used to count the frequency of each stick length.
   - The function then calculates how many complete polygons (triangles, squares, etc.) can be formed by dividing the frequency of each stick length by 3 (since each polygon has at least 3 sides).

3. **Polygon Formation:**
   - The program assumes that the maximum number of polygons that can be formed is determined by the minimum number of sets of three sticks of the same length.
   - This logic is flawed because it doesn't consider the possibility of forming multiple polygons with different side lengths simultaneously.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - **Test Case 1:** `arr = [1]`
     - Frequency: `{1: 1}`
     - Result: `1 // 3 = 0` (Correct)
   - **Test Case 2:** `arr = [1, 1]`
     - Frequency: `{1: 2}`
     - Result: `2 // 3 = 0` (Correct)
   - **Test Case 3:** `arr = [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3]`
     - Frequency: `{2: 2, 3: 4}`
     - Result: `2 // 3 + 4 // 3 = 0 + 1 = 1` (Correct)
   - **Test Case 4:** `arr = [4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 4, 4]`
     - Frequency: `{2: 5, 4: 4}`
     - Result: `5 // 3 + 4 // 3 = 1 + 1 = 2` (Correct)

5. **Conclusion:**
   - While the program works correctly for the specific examples provided, it does not handle the general case where multiple polygons with different side lengths can be formed simultaneously.

### Correctness Check:

Given the problem statement and the provided examples, the program should be able to handle cases where multiple polygons can be formed with different side lengths. However, the current implementation only considers the minimum number of sets of three sticks of the same length.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of forming multiple polygons with different side lengths simultaneously.
