Output State: **`arr` must contain at least one element; `freq` is a dictionary with one entry where the key is `n` and the value is 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the frequency count of `n` in the dictionary `freq`. Since `freq` was initially an empty dictionary, after executing `freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1`, the dictionary `freq` will have one entry where the key is `n` and the value is 1. The precondition that `arr` must contain at least one element remains unchanged.
