Output State: The `arr` list is now empty, and `freq` is a dictionary containing entries for each unique stick length found in `arr` during the loop's execution. The value for each key in `freq` is the count of how many times that particular stick length appeared in `arr`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, every stick length present in the original `arr` will be a key in the `freq` dictionary, with its corresponding value being the total count of occurrences of that stick length in `arr`.
