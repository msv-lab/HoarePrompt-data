Postcondition: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is an input integer that must be at least 1, `i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `count` is the number of '1's in the string `a`. If the index of the first '1' in the string `a` exists and the character immediately following the first '1' is not '1', the condition is met as is. Otherwise, the condition remains unchanged.**
