Postcondition: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is an input integer that must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `a` is exactly 2, the count of '1's in the string `a` is even, and the current value of `a`'s index of the first '1' is not followed immediately by another '1'.
