Postcondition: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is an input integer that must be at least 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `count` is the number of '1's in the string `a`. If the index of '1' in string `a` does not have another '1' immediately following it, the condition remains unchanged. Otherwise, the condition remains unchanged.**

This postcondition essentially states that regardless of whether the if condition is met or not, the variables `start`, `end`, `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, and `count` retain their original values because the if-else block does not modify any of these variables.
