Postcondition: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is an input integer that must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string with at least one occurrence of '1', and the count of '1's in the string `a` is either greater than 2 and even, or exactly 2 and even with specific conditions (index of the first '1' exists and the character immediately following it is not '1', or the index of the first '1' does not exist or the character immediately following it is '1').
