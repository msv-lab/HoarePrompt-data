Based on the initial state provided:

- `start` is an integer.
- `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`.
- `t` is an input integer that must be at least 1.
- `i` is initialized to 1.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input string where the number of occurrences of '1' is exactly 2, and the count of '1's in the string `a` is even. Additionally, the index of the first '1' in `a` exists, and the character immediately following the first '1' in `a` is not '1'.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
