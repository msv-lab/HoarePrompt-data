Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(t)`.
   - The variable `i` is the loop counter.
   - The variable `t` is used as the upper limit for the range function.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: 
   - In the first iteration of the loop, `i` should be set to 0.
   - After each iteration, `i` increments by 1.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < t`.

4. **Adjust the state based on the loop head**:
   - We need to ensure that the loop can start and continue executing. This means `i` should be initialized to 0 and `t` should be a positive integer (since `start` <= `end` and `t` is an input integer, `t` must be at least 1).

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
- `i` should be 0.
- `t` must be at least 1.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:
**`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is an input integer that must be at least 1, `i` is 0**.

So, the answer is:
State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is an input integer that must be at least 1, `i` is 0**
