Output State: `cur` is the maximum value in `N` if every element in `N` is greater than `cur + 1` during the loop execution, otherwise `cur` is the last element in `N` that satisfies `num > cur`. `i` is `len(N)`, `S` is an input integer, `T` is `1`, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `M` is a dictionary where the key is `-1` and the value is the count of elements in `N` that are less than or equal to `-1`, and `num` is the last element of `N`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `cur` will hold the highest value in `N` that was incremented during the loop, or it will be the last element in `N` if no such value was found. The variable `i` will be set to the length of the list `N` since the loop condition `for num in N:` iterates through all elements of `N`. The dictionary `M` will contain the count of elements in `N` that are less than or equal to `-1`.
