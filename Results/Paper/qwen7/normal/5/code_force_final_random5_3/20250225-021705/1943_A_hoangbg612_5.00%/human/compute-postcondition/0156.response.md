Output State: **`cur` is either the last element of `N` or -1, `i` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `T` is 1, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input split by spaces (now including its last element), `M` is a dictionary with key `-1` and value either `1` or `2`, and `num` is the last element of `N`.**

Explanation: The code `cur += 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1. Initially, `cur` is either the second-to-last element of `N` or -1. After incrementing, `cur` becomes either the last element of `N` or -1 (if `cur` was -1). The values of `i`, `S`, `T`, `N`, `M`, and `num` remain unchanged.
