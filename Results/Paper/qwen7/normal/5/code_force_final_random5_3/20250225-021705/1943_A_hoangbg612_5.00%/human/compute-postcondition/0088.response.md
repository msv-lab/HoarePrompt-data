Output State: **`M[cur]` is incremented by 1, `N` must contain at least one element, `num` is the next element in `N`.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `M[cur]` by 1. The other variables, `N` and `num`, remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `M[cur]` is updated, while `N` and `num` retain their original conditions.
