Output State: **`cur` is within the range [0, i], `i` is within the range [0, cur - 1) and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified in the code snippet, the `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply indicates that we would exit the most internal loop or conditional block if one were present. Therefore, the values of `cur` and `i` remain unchanged, and the only effect is that we break out of the most internal loop or conditional block.
