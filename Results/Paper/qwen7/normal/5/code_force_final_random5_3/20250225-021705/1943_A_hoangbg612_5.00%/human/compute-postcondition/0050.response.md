Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and `cur`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `cur`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `cur` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - There is a condition inside the loop that breaks if `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `cur`. Given that `cur` is greater than 0, `i` being 1 is still valid as long as `cur` is greater than 1.
   - The condition inside the loop (if `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`) does not affect the loop continuation directly but could cause a break if true.

5. **Final State Adjustment**:
   - `cur` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration (greater than 0).
   - `i` is incremented to 1.
   - `cur` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`cur` is greater than 1, `i` is 1**
