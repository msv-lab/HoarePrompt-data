Output State: **`cur` is equal to `i`, and the current value of `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`.**

Explanation: The value of `cur` is updated to be equal to `i`. The condition that the current value of `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i` remains unchanged as no operation affects `M` or its index `i`.
