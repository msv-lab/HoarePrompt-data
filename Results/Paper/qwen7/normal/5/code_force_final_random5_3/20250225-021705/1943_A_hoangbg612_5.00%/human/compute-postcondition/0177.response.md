Output State: **`cur` is within the range `[0, i]`, `i` is within the range `[0, cur - 1)`**

Explanation: The code `cur = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `cur`. Since `i` was originally within the range `[0, cur - 1)`, after the assignment, `cur` will take the value of `i`, and thus `cur` will also be within the same range. The range of `i` remains unchanged.
