Output State: **`i` is equal to `cur`, `cur` is `cur + 1`, `S` remains unchanged, and if `M[cur]` is less than or equal to `cur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code `cur = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `cur`. The initial state tells us that `i` is equal to `cur`, so after executing the code, `i` and `cur` will have the same value. The other variables (`S` and the condition involving `M[cur]`) remain unchanged.
