Output State: **`N` must have at least one element (one less than before), `num` is the next element in `N`, `cur` is equal to `num`, `M[cur]` is updated to 1 if `num > cur`, otherwise `M[cur]` is increased by 1, and `M[cur]` is now 1.**

This means that the value of `M[cur]` has been set to 1 based on the condition given. All other variables remain in their respective states as described in the initial state.
