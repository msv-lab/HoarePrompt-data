Postcondition: `cur` is the next element in `N`, `N` must contain at least one element, and `M[cur]` is either incremented by 1 or set to 1 depending on whether `num` is greater than `cur`. If `num` is greater than `cur`, `cur` is now equal to `num` and `M[cur]` is set to 1. If `num` is not greater than `cur + 1`, `cur` remains the next element in `N` and `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.
