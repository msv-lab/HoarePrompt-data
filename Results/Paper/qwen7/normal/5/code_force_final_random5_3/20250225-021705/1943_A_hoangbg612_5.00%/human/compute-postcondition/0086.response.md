Output State: **`cur` is now equal to `num`, `N` must contain at least one element, `num` is the next element in `N`.**

Explanation: The code `cur = num` assigns the value of `num` to `cur`. The postconditions that `N` must contain at least one element and `num` is the next element in `N` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `cur` being set to the value of `num`, while the conditions on `N` and `num` remain as specified.
