Output State: **`cur` is 0, `i` is 0**.

Explanation: The code `cur = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 0) to `cur`. Since `i` was initially 0, `cur` now holds the same value. The precondition that `cur` must be greater than 0 is no longer valid because `cur` is now 0. However, the initial value of `i` being 0 remains unchanged.
