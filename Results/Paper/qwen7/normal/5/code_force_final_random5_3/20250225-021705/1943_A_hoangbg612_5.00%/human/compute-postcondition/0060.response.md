Output State: **cur is greater than or equal to the length of N, and i is the value of cur minus 1.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `cur` will be set to the largest index value that satisfies the condition `M[i] <= i` for all `i` from 0 up to (but not including) `cur`. The variable `i` will hold the value of `cur - 1`, which is the last index that caused the loop to break. All other variables in the initial state remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop's execution.
