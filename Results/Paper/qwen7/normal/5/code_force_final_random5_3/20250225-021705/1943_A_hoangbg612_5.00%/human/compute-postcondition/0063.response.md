Output State: **`cur` is greater than or equal to the length of `N`, `i` is the value of `cur` minus 1, `S` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `S = int(input())` assigns the value of the input converted to an integer to the variable `S`. The values of `cur` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
