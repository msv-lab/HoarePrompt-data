Output State: **`cur` is either the second-to-last element of `N` or -1 plus 1, `i` is 0, `S` is an input integer, `T` is 1, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `M` is a dictionary with key `-1` and value either `1` or `2`, and `num` is the last element of `N`.**

Explanation: The code `M[cur] += 1` increments the value of `M[cur]` by 1. Since `cur` is either the second-to-last element of `N` or -1, `M[cur]` will be incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
