Output State: **`N` must contain at least one element, and the number `num` is less than or equal to the current element `cur` in the list `N`; `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the list `N` and the condition involving `num` and `cur` remain unchanged from the initial state. However, the value of `M[cur]` is incremented by 1 due to the execution of the code snippet.
