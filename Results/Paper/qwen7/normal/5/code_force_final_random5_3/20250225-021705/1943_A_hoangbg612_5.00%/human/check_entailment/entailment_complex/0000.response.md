Reasoning:
1. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, it does not account for the different strategies of Alice and Bob in picking elements from the array \(a\).
2. The program sorts the array \(N\) and then tries to find the maximum value \(cur\) that meets certain conditions, which does not align with the optimal strategy for the game described.
3. The MEX (Minimum Excludant) of the final array \(c\) depends on the sequence of moves made by both players, not just the sorted order of the initial array \(a\).
4. Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it. The provided program does not simulate these strategic choices.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the logic needed to determine the optimal MEX for the game.

Correctness: **False**
