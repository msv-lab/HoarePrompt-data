Postcondition: `cur` is increased by 1, `N` must contain at least one element, `num` is the next element in `N`, and if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, `cur` is increased by 1 and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `num` is not greater than `cur + 1`, the postcondition remains as `cur` being increased by 1, `N` containing at least one element, and `num` being the next element in `N`.
