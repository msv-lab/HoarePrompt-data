Output State: **`i` is `cur + 1`, `cur` is `i`, `S` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `cur`, or `S`. It only indicates that the program will exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is currently inside. Since no new assignments or changes are made to the variables, their values remain as they were in the initial state.
