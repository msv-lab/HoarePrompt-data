Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range `cur`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `cur` is the maximum value in `N` that satisfies the condition `num > cur`, or the second-highest number plus one if the highest number does not satisfy the condition.
   - `i` is 1 if the last element of `N` is greater than `cur`, otherwise it is 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will run from `i` to `cur-1` (inclusive). For the loop to execute, `cur` must be at least 1, and `i` must be within the range `[0, cur)`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to either 0 or 1 based on the last element of `N` being greater than `cur`, we need to ensure that `i` is within the range `[0, cur)`.
   - `cur` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `cur` and `i`.

**State:**
- `cur` must be at least 1.
- `i` must be within the range `[0, cur)`.

So, the final state should be:

**State: **`cur` must be at least 1, `i` must be within the range `[0, cur)`**.
