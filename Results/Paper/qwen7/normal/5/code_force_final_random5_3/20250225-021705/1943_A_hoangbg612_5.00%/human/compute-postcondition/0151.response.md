Output State: **`cur` is the second-to-last element of `N`, `i` is 0, `S` is an input integer, `T` is 1, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input split by spaces without its last element, `M` is a dictionary with key `-1` and value `1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `num` (which is the second-to-last element of `N`) to `cur`. All other variables remain unchanged.
