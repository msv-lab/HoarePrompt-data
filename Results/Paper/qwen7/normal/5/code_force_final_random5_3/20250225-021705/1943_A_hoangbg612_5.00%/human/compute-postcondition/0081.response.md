Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `num` and the collection `N`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `N` contains at least one element.

3. **Understand the loop body behavior**:
   - If `num` is greater than `cur + 1` and `M[cur]` is 1, then `cur` is set to `num`.
   - Otherwise, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.

4. **State at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `N` must contain at least one element.
   - `num` is the current element being processed from `N`.
   - `cur` and `M` are not explicitly mentioned in the state, but they are part of the loop logic.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `num` is the current element being processed, it will be the next element in `N` for the next iteration.
   - `N` must still contain at least one element for the loop to continue.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `N` must contain at least one element (since it must continue to have at least one element for the loop to execute).
- `num` will be the next element in `N`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`N` must contain at least one element, `num` is the next element in `N`**.
