Output State: **`cur` is now equal to `num`, `N` must contain at least one element, `M[cur]` is now equal to 1, and if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code `M[cur] = 1` sets the value of `M[cur]` to 1. This changes the value of `M[cur]` from its previous state (either incremented by 1 or set to 1) to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
