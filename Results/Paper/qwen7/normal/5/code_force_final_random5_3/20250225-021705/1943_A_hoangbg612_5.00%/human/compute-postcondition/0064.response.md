Output State: **`cur` is greater than or equal to the length of N, `i` is the value of `cur` minus 1, `N` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `S` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `N = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. These integers are then converted into a list and assigned to the variable `N`. The values of `cur` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
