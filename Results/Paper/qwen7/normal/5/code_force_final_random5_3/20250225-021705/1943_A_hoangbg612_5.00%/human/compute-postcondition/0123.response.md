Output: **len(N) (where len(N) is the number of ones in the list M)**

Explanation:
- `cur` is explicitly defined as equal to `len(N)`.
- `N` is a list whose length is the same as the number of ones in the list `M`.
- Therefore, `cur` holds the value of `len(N)`.
- When the `print(cur)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `cur`, which is `len(N)`.
