Output State: **All entries in `M` are either 0 or 1, with exactly `len(N)` ones in total, `cur` is equal to `len(N)`, `i` is equal to `len(N) - 1`, `S` is an input integer, `T` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `S` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it now holds the integer value entered by the user. The values of `M`, `cur`, `i`, and `T` remain unchanged from their initial states.
