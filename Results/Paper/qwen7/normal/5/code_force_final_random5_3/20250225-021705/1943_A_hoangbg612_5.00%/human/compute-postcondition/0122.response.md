Output State: **All entries in `M` are either 0 or 1, with exactly `len(N)` ones in total. `cur` is equal to `len(N)`. `i` is equal to `len(N) - 1`. `S` is equal to `len(N)`.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, every entry in `M` will be set to either 0 or 1, where 1 indicates that the index was the highest number found in `N` at some point during the loop's iterations. Since the loop runs until every possible index from 0 to `len(N) - 1` is checked, there will be exactly `len(N)` ones in `M`. The variable `cur` will be equal to `len(N)`, indicating that the highest number found in `N` is the last index. The variable `i` retains its last incremented value, which is `len(N) - 1`. The variable `S` remains unchanged and equals `len(N)`, as it represents the count of ones in `M`.
