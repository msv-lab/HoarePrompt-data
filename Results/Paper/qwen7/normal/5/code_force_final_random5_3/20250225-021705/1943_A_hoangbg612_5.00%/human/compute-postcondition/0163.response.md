Postcondition: `cur` is either the last element of `N` (if `num > cur`), or the second-to-last element of `N` incremented by 1 (if `num <= cur`). `i` is 1 if `num > cur`, otherwise it remains 0. `S` is an input integer, `T` is 1, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `M` is a dictionary with key `-1` and value either `1` or `2`, and `num` is the last element of `N`.
