Output State: **`M[cur]` is 1, `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, `cur` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value `1` to the element of the list `M` at the index `cur`. The values of `num` and `cur` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. Therefore, `num` is still greater than `cur + 1`, and `cur` is still equal to `num`.
