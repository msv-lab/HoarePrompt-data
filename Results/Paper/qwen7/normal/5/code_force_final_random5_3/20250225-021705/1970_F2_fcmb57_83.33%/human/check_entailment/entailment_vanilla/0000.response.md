Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly parses the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) of the field.
   - It initializes dictionaries to store player positions, goal positions, and the initial position of the Quaffle.
   - The function `func_1` is defined to handle movement calculations, which is used correctly later in the code.

2. **Field Description Processing**:
   - The program iterates over the field to populate the `players`, `goals`, and `quidditch` variables. This part is handled correctly.

3. **Game Steps Processing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of steps \( T \).
   - For each step, it processes the action:
     - If the action is a movement (`ULDR`), it updates the player's position using `func_1`.
     - If the action is catching the ball (`C`), it updates the Quaffle holder.
     - If the action is throwing the Quaffle (`T`), it updates the Quaffle's position and checks if a goal is scored.
   - The program handles player elimination correctly when a Bludger hits a player.
   - The program prints the appropriate events (scoring, elimination) in the correct format and order.

4. **Final Score Calculation**:
   - After processing all steps, the program correctly prints the final score.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to follow the problem specification accurately and handles all the required functionalities without errors.

Correctness: **True**
