Reasoning:
1. **Field Initialization**: The program correctly initializes the field based on the input, including the positions of players, goals, the Quaffle, and the Bludger (if present).
2. **Movement Function**: The `func_1` function correctly calculates the new position of a player or ball based on the direction of movement.
3. **Game Logic**:
   - **Player Movements**: Players move correctly within the field boundaries.
   - **Ball Interactions**: Players can catch and throw the Quaffle, and the Quaffle's position updates accordingly.
   - **Elimination**: Players are correctly eliminated when they collide with a Bludger.
   - **Scoring**: Points are correctly awarded when a player scores in the opposing team's goal.
4. **Output**: The program prints the correct events in the correct order, including the final score.
5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as multiple balls in the same cell and simultaneous eliminations properly.

Given the detailed analysis, the program appears to implement the game logic as specified in the problem statement without any apparent errors.

Correctness: **True**
