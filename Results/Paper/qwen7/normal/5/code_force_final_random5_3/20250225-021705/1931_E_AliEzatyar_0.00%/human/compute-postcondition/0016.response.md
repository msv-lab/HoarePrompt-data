Output State: **`num` remains the same, `i` is one less than its previous value, `counter` is incremented by 1**.

Explanation: The variable `counter` is incremented by 1. The values of `num` and `i` remain unchanged from their previous states. The condition for incrementing `counter` (if `num[i]` is '0') is not specified in the code snippet, so it does not affect the output state directly. The only change is that `counter` has been incremented by 1.
