Output State: **`counter` is 1, `i` is `len(num) - 1`**.

Explanation: The code increments the `counter` by 1. Initially, `counter` was not specified, so it is set to 1 after the increment. The value of `i` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it; it is still `len(num) - 1`. The condition that `num` is an integer where \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\) and the current value of `num[i]` is '0' is still valid.
