Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `num` is an integer where \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\).
   - `i` is `len(num) - 1`.
   - If `num[i]` is '0', then `counter` is 1.
   - Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from `len(num) - 1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches -1.
   - Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since the loop is decrementing `i`, the next value of `i` will be `i - 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i >= 0`.

5. **New State:**
   - `num` remains the same because the loop does not modify `num`.
   - `i` will be `i - 1` (decremented by 1).
   - The condition `num[i]` being '0' or not does not change the loop continuation directly; it affects the `counter` but not the loop itself.

Given these points, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`num` is an integer where \(1 \leq num \leq 10^9\), `i` is `len(num) - 2`.**
