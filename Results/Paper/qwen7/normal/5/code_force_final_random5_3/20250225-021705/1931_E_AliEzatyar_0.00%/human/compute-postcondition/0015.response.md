Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **Postcondition**: `num` remains the same, `i` is decremented by 1. If `num[i]` is '0', then `counter` is incremented by 1. If `num[i]` is not '0', we break out of the loop.
- **Loop Statement**: 
  ```python
  for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
      # the loop body is omit
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Loop Variables**: The loop variable in this case is `i`.
2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop runs from `len(num) - 1` to `0` (inclusive), decrementing `i` by 1 each time.
3. **Postcondition Analysis**:
   - `num` remains the same.
   - `i` is decremented by 1.
   - If `num[i]` is '0', `counter` is incremented by 1.
   - If `num[i]` is not '0', the loop breaks.

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `num` remains the same.
- `i` is decremented by 1.
- If `num[i]` is '0', `counter` is incremented by 1.
- If `num[i]` is not '0', the loop breaks.

### Next Iteration:
- Since `i` is decremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be one less than its current value.
- The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.

### Adjusted State:
- `num` remains the same.
- `i` is now one less than its previous value.
- If `num[i]` is '0', `counter` is incremented by 1.
- If `num[i]` is not '0', the loop breaks.

### Final Answer:
State: **`num` remains the same, `i` is one less than its previous value, if `num[i]` is '0', `counter` is incremented by 1, if `num[i]` is not '0', the loop breaks.**

To be more precise in the format requested:
State: **`num` remains the same, `i` is one less than its previous value, if `num[i]` is '0', `counter` is incremented by 1, if `num[i]` is not '0', the loop breaks.**
