Output State: **`num` remains the same, `i` is one less than its previous value, and we break out of the loop.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the loop prematurely. Since the loop was iterating over the elements of `num` and checking the condition for each element, once the `break` statement is encountered, the loop exits immediately. The value of `i` is one less than its previous value because the loop would have decremented `i` before encountering the `break` statement. The value of `counter` remains unchanged as the increment operation (`counter += 1`) does not occur due to the premature exit of the loop.
