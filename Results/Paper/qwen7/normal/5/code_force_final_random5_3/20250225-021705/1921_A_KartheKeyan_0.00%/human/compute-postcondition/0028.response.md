Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(4):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i`.

2. **Determine the current state of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than 4 (since `range(4)` generates values from 0 to 3).

4. **Update the state of `i`**: Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 3.

5. **Check if the loop should continue**: With `i` now being 3, the condition `i < 4` is still true, so the loop will execute one more time.

6. **Adjust the states of the other variables**: The other variables (`res`, `n`, `coord`, `p1`, `p2`) are not part of the loop head and their states do not change based on the loop itself.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`res` is 0, `n` is 1, `coord` is a list containing one tuple `(x, y)`, `i` is 3, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0**
