Output State: **`res` is 0, `n` is 1, `coord` is a list containing three tuples `[ (x, y), (x, y), (x, y) ]`, `i` is 4, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0**.

Explanation: The code `coord.append((x, y))` adds a new tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Initially, `coord` contains two tuples. After appending `(x, y)`, `coord` now contains three tuples, each being `(x, y)`. All other variables (`res`, `n`, `i`, `p1`, `p2`) remain unchanged.
