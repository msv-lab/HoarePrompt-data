Reasoning:
1. The provided program correctly reads the number of test cases (`n`) and processes each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates and stores them in the `coord` list.
3. It sorts the coordinates, which helps in identifying the correct pairs of points that form the sides of the square.
4. It then calculates the squared distances between the first and second point, and the third and fourth point. These distances should represent the side lengths of the square.
5. Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the distance between the points should be the same in both the x and y directions.
6. The program calculates the area by taking the square root of the sum of the squared distances and then squares the result to get the area of the square.
7. The logic seems sound for calculating the area of a square given its corner coordinates, assuming the points are correctly identified as forming a square.

Given this analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the area of the square.

Correctness: **True**
