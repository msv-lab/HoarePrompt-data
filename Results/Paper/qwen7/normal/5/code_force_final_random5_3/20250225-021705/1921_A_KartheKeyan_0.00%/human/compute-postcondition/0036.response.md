Output State: **`res` is 0, `n` is 1, `coord` is a list containing four sorted tuples `[ (x, y), (x, y), (x, y), (x, y) ]`, `i` is 5, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `coord = sorted(coord)` sorts the `coord` list in ascending order based on the tuples' natural ordering (lexicographical order). Since the initial `coord` list contains four tuples, after sorting, `coord` will still contain four tuples, but they will be sorted. The other variables (`res`, `n`, `i`, `p1`, `p2`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the sorting operation.
