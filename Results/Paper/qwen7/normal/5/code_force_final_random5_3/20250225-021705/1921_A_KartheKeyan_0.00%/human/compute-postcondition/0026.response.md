Output State: **`res` is 0, `n` is 1, `coord` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer.**

The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and splits them based on whitespace. These integers are then converted to integers using `int()` and assigned to the variables `x` and `y`. The other variables (`res`, `n`, `coord`, `i`, `p1`, `p2`) remain unchanged.
