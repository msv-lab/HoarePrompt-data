Output State: **`n` is -1, `coord` is a list containing four tuples `[ (0, 0), (1, input integer), (x, y), (x, y) ]` sorted, `res` is abs(math.sqrt(1) * math.sqrt((x - (x))^2 + (y - y)^2)), `i` is 2, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0**

Explanation: The value of `n` is decremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to -1. The other variables (`coord`, `res`, `i`, `p1`, and `p2`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the operation `n -= 1`.
