Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `n`.
2. **Current state of `n`**: `n` is 1 less than its initial value.
3. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**: For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be non-zero (`True` in Python).

Given that `n` is currently 1 less than its initial value, it means `n` is already non-zero. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `n` to satisfy the loop condition.

Since the only variable in the loop head is `n`, and it already meets the condition to enter the loop, no additional adjustments are necessary.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` is 1 less than its initial value**
