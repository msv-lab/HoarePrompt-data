Output State: **`res` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `coord` is an empty list, `i` is 5, `p2` is 0**

Explanation: The code `coord = []` assigns an empty list to the variable `coord`. This overwrites the previous value of `coord`, which was a list containing four sorted tuples. The values of `res`, `n`, `i`, and `p2` remain unchanged. Since `coord[3]` and `coord[2]` no longer exist (as `coord` is now an empty list), `p2` is calculated as `0 - 0`, which is `0`.
