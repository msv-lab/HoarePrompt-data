Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(size - overlap)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `size - overlap`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `size - overlap` is 12
   - `sequence` contains the value `overlap`
   - `sequence` now also contains the value `i + overlap`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < size - overlap`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2.
   - The value of `size - overlap` remains unchanged at 12.
   - The `sequence` list already contains `overlap` and `i + overlap` (which is `1 + overlap`). For the next iteration, no additional values need to be added to `sequence` based on the given information.

5. **Formulate the new state**: Based on the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
   - `i` is 2
   - `size - overlap` is still 12
   - `sequence` contains the value `overlap` and `i + overlap` (which is `1 + overlap`)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 2, `size - overlap` is 12, `sequence` contains the value `overlap` and `i + overlap`**
