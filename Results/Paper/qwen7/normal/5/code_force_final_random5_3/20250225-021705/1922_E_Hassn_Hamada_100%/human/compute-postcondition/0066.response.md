Output State: `i` is 11, `size - overlap` is 12, `sequence` contains the values `overlap`, `i + overlap`, `i + 2 * overlap`, ..., `i + 11 * overlap`.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = size - overlap - 1`, which means it will run 12 times since `size` is 12 and `overlap` is 0. After 12 iterations, `i` will be 11. During each iteration, the value `i + overlap` is appended to `sequence`. Since `overlap` is 0, the sequence will contain `0`, `1`, `2`, ..., `11`.
