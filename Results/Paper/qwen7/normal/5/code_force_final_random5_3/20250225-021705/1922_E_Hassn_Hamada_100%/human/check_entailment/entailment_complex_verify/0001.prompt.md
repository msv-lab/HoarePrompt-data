You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

    #
    #This output state indicates that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `size_overlap` will be set to (12, 0) because the loop continues to increment `size` until it reaches its maximum possible value given the constraints, which in this case is 12 when `i` is 0 and `number` is at least 128. The `value` calculated during the final iteration is 1022, and since `i` is now 0, no further changes occur to `size_overlap`.

    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = size - overlap - 1`, which means it will run 12 times since `size` is 12 and `overlap` is 0. After 12 iterations, `i` will be 11. During each iteration, the value `i + overlap` is appended to `sequence`. Since `overlap` is 0, the sequence will contain `0`, `1`, `2`, ..., `11`.
    func_1(number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap), sequence)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `number` (where \(2 \leq number \leq 10^{18}\)) and a list of integers `sequence`. It generates a sequence of numbers based on `number` and modifies `sequence` accordingly. If `number` is 0, the function returns two zeros. Otherwise, it calculates a `size_overlap` pair and appends a sequence of numbers to `sequence` based on this pair. Finally, it recursively calls itself with updated `number` and `sequence` values. The function ultimately returns two zeros.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences, `X`. The provided solution attempts to generate such an array using a recursive function `func_1`.

2. **Recursive Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of numbers based on the input `number`.
   - It uses bitwise operations to determine the structure of the sequence.
   - The goal is to create a sequence where the number of increasing subsequences matches the input `X`.

3. **Base Case and Recursive Case**:
   - If `number` is 0, the function returns immediately.
   - For non-zero `number`, it iterates backward from the maximum value in the current sequence to find the appropriate size and value for the next element in the sequence.
   - It updates the sequence and recursively calls itself with the updated `number`.

4. **Sequence Generation**:
   - The sequence generation logic seems to be based on powers of 2, which is a common approach to achieve specific counts of increasing subsequences.
   - The sequence is built by appending values that ensure the desired count of increasing subsequences.

5. **Output Handling**:
   - The main loop reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - It calls `func_1` to generate the sequence and prints its length and elements.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles the base case correctly when `number` is 0.
   - It uses bitwise operations to efficiently determine the sequence structure, which is crucial for achieving the exact count of increasing subsequences.

7. **Validation**:
   - The provided code does not explicitly handle cases where it is impossible to generate the required sequence (e.g., when `X` is too large).
   - However, the approach seems sound for the given constraints.

### Conclusion:

The provided code appears to correctly implement the logic to generate an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences. The use of bitwise operations and recursive function calls ensures that the sequence is generated in a way that meets the requirements.

### Correctness:

Correctness: **True**
