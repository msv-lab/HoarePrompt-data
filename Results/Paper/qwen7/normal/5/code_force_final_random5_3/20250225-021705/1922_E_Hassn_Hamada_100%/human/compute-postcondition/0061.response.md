Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `size - overlap`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < size - overlap`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `size - overlap` is 12
   - `sequence` contains the value `overlap`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, and the loop condition is `i < size - overlap`, the loop will execute again because `0 < 12` is true.
   - After the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 1.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `size - overlap` remains unchanged at 12.
   - The state of `sequence` does not change according to the loop head, so it remains as "contains the value `overlap`".

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `size - overlap` is 12, `sequence` contains the value `overlap`**
