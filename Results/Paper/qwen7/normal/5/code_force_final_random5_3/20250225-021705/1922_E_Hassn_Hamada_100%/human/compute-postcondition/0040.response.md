Output State: **`size` is 7, `i` is 7, `number` is at least 14, `value` is 63, and `size_overlap` is (7, 7)**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `size` is 7, `i` is 6, `number` is at least 14, `value` is 127, and `size_overlap` is (7, 7).
- The code updates `size` to its current value plus 1, so `size` remains 7.
- It also updates `value` to `(1 << i + 1) - (1 << i)`. Here, `i + 1` is 7, so `1 << 7` is 128 and `1 << 6` is 64. Therefore, `value` becomes `128 - 64`, which is 64 - 1 = 63.
- The values of `i`, `number`, and `size_overlap` remain unchanged.
