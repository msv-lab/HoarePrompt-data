Output State: **`size_overlap` is (0, 1), `sequence` must be non-negative, `i` is max(sequence, default=0), `size` is `i + 2`, `value` is \(1 << i\), and `number` must be at least 3.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `value` to \((1 << size) - (1 << i)\). Given the initial state, `size` is defined as `i + 2`. Therefore, the new value of `value` is calculated as \(1 << (i + 2) - 1 << i\). Since `i` is initially defined as `max(sequence, default=0)`, and `sequence` is non-negative, the minimum value of `i` is 0. Thus, the value of `value` simplifies to \(1 << (i + 2) - 1 << i = 4 - 1 = 3\) when `i` is 0. This value remains the same regardless of the actual value of `sequence` because `i` is determined by `max(sequence, default=0)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
