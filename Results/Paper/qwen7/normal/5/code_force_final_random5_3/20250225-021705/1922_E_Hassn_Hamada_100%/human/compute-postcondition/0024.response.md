Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number`.

2. **Analyze the loop variables**:
   - `size` is given as 3.
   - `i` is given as at least 1.
   - `number` is not directly provided, but we need to ensure the condition holds true for the first iteration.

3. **Substitute the known values into the loop condition**:
   - `size` is 3, so `1 << size + 1` becomes `1 << 4`, which is 16.
   - The loop condition then becomes `16 - (1 << i) <= number`.

4. **Determine the minimum value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` must be at least 1, let's start with `i = 1`.
   - For `i = 1`, `1 << i` is `1 << 1`, which is 2.
   - The condition then becomes `16 - 2 <= number`, or `14 <= number`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `number` must be at least 14.
   - The other variables (`size_overlap`, `sequence`, and `value`) do not affect the loop condition and do not need adjustment.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute the first time:

State: **`size_overlap` remains (2, 1), `sequence` must be non-negative, `i` must be at least 1, `size` is 3, `number` must be at least 14**
