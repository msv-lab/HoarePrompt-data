Output State: **`size_overlap` is (7, 7), `size` is 7, `i` is 7, `number` is at least 14, `value` is 127.**

Explanation: The code assigns the values of `size` and `i` to `size_overlap`. Since both `size` and `i` are initially 7, `size_overlap` becomes a tuple containing these two values. The other variables (`number`, `value`) remain unchanged.
