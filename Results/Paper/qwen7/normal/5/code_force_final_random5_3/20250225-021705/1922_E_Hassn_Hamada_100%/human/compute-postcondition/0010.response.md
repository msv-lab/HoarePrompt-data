Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The loop condition is: \((1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) \leq number\)
- The variables at the end of the previous iteration are:
  - `size_overlap` is (0, 1)
  - `sequence` must be non-negative
  - `i` is `max(sequence, default=0)`
  - `size` is `i + 2`
  - `value` is \(1 << i\)
  - `number` must be at least 3

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop continues as long as \((1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) \leq number\).
   - We need to check the values of `size` and `i` to determine if the loop can continue.

2. **Current Values:**
   - `size` is `i + 2`.
   - `i` is `max(sequence, default=0)`.
   - `sequence` is non-negative, so `i` is at least 0.
   - `size` is then at least 2 (since `i` is at least 0).

3. **Loop Condition with Current Values:**
   - \((1 << size + 1) - (1 << i)\) becomes \((1 << (i + 2) + 1) - (1 << i)\).
   - Simplifying, this is \((1 << (i + 3)) - (1 << i)\).
   - This can be written as \(8 \cdot (1 << i) - (1 << i) = 7 \cdot (1 << i)\).

4. **Ensuring the Loop Can Continue:**
   - For the loop to continue, \(7 \cdot (1 << i) \leq number\).
   - Since `number` must be at least 3, we need to ensure that \(7 \cdot (1 << i) \leq number\).

5. **Initial Value of `i`:**
   - At the start, `i` is 0 (since `sequence` is non-negative and `max(sequence, default=0)` is 0).
   - When `i` is 0, \(7 \cdot (1 << 0) = 7 \cdot 1 = 7\).
   - Since `number` must be at least 3, the condition \(7 \leq number\) is always satisfied.

6. **Next Iteration:**
   - To ensure the loop can continue, `i` must be incremented.
   - Therefore, `i` should be increased to at least 1.

### Adjusted States:
- `i` must be at least 1.
- `size` will then be `i + 2`, which is 3 when `i` is 1.
- The loop condition will then be checked with these new values.

### Final Answer:
State: **`size_overlap` is (0, 1), `sequence` must be non-negative, `i` must be at least 1, `size` is `i + 2`, `value` is \(1 << i\), and `number` must be at least 3.**
