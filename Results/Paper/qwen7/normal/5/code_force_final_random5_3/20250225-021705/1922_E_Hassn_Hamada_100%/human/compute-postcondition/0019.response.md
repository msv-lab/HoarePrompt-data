Output State: **`size_overlap` is (`i` + 3, `i`); `sequence` must be non-negative, `i` must be at least 2, `size` is `i` + 3, `value` is \(2^{i+3} - 2^i\)**

Explanation: The code updates `size_overlap` to be a tuple of `size` and `i`. Given that `size` is defined as `i + 3`, `size_overlap` becomes (`i` + 3, `i`). All other conditions and variable constraints remain unchanged.
