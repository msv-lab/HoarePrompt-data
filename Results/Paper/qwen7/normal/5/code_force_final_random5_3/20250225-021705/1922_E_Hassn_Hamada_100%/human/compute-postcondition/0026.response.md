Output State: **`size` is 4, `size_overlap` remains (2, 1), `sequence` must be non-negative, `i` must be at least 1, `number` must be at least 14, `value` is 14.**

Explanation: The code calculates `value` using the formula `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`. Given `size` is 4 and `i` is at least 1, let's assume the minimum value for `i` which is 1 for the calculation:

- `(1 << 4)` is `16`.
- `(1 << 1)` is `2`.

So, `value = 16 - 2 = 14`. The values of `size`, `size_overlap`, `sequence`, `i`, and `number` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code.
