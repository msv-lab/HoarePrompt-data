Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `i` is 0
- `kq` is `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]`

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `0` to `len(a) // 2 - 1`.
2. **Increment**: `i` is incremented by `1` in each iteration.
3. **Initial Value of `i`**: `i` starts at `0`.

### Current State
- `i` is currently `0`.
- `kq` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.

### Next Iteration
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `1`.
- The condition for the loop to continue is `i < len(a) // 2`.

Since `i` is currently `0`, after the first iteration, `i` will become `1`.

### Updated State
- `i` will be `1`.
- `kq` remains `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]` because it is not modified within the loop.

### Final Answer
State: **`i` is 1, `kq` is `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]`**
