To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the operations performed:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is set to `len(a) // 2`. This means `i` is the integer division of the length of the list `a` by 2.
   - `kq` is the sum of the elements at even indices subtracted from the sum of the elements at odd indices in the list `a`.

2. **Operations Performed**:
   - The loop iterates over the first half of the list `a`, starting from the last element and moving towards the first.
   - In each iteration, it updates `kq` by adding the difference between the corresponding elements from the end and the beginning of the list.

Given this information, let's consider the value of `kq` after the loop completes. Since the loop updates `kq` based on the differences between elements from the end and the beginning of the list, the final value of `kq` will be the net effect of these differences.

However, without the actual list `a`, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `kq`. But we know that `kq` is the result of the described operation on the list `a`.

Therefore, the output will be the computed value of `kq` based on the list `a`.

Output: **kq (where kq is the sum of the elements at even indices subtracted from the sum of the elements at odd indices in the list a)**
