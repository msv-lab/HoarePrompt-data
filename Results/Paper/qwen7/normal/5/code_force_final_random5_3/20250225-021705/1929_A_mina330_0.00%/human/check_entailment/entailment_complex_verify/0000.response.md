### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to find the maximum beauty of an array \(a\) defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). To maximize this, we need to maximize the differences between consecutive elements.

#### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array itself. It then sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between the largest and smallest elements in pairs from both ends of the sorted array.

#### Key Points in the Annotated Code:
- The array is sorted.
- The beauty is calculated by pairing the largest and smallest elements from the sorted array.
- The program iterates over the first half of the sorted array, adding the difference between the corresponding elements from the start and end of the array.

#### Correctness of the Approach:
The approach taken in the program is actually correct. Here's why:

1. **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array ensures that the smallest elements are paired with the largest elements, which is crucial for maximizing the differences.
2. **Pairing Elements**: By iterating through the first half of the sorted array and calculating the difference between the largest and smallest elements, the program effectively maximizes the beauty of the array.

Let's consider the example provided in the original assessment:
- Input: `4 10 5 3 8`
- Sorted array: `[3, 5, 8, 10]`
- Calculated beauty: \((10-3) + (8-5) = 7 + 3 = 10\)

This is indeed the maximum possible beauty for this array. If we were to pair the elements differently, the beauty would not be greater than 10. For instance, if we pair `[5, 10, 3, 8]`, the beauty would be \((10-5) + (8-3) = 5 + 5 = 10\), which is the same.

Therefore, the program correctly maximizes the beauty of the array by sorting it and then pairing the largest and smallest elements.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly states that the program's approach does not always yield the maximum beauty. The program's approach is indeed correct and always yields the maximum possible beauty for the given constraints.

**Final: True**
