Output State: **`ntest` is an input integer, `itest` must be between 0 and `ntest`-1 inclusive, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `kq` is `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]`, `len(a)` must be at least 2, `i` is 0**

Explanation: The code updates `kq` by adding the difference between the last element (`a[len(a) - i - 1]`) and the first element (`a[i]`) of the list `a`. Since `i` is initially 0, `a[len(a) - i - 1]` is `a[len(a) - 1]` and `a[i]` is `a[0]`. Thus, `kq` is updated to `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
