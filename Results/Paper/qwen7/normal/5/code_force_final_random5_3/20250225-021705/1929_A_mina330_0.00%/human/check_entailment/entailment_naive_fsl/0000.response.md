Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program attempts to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting it and then pairing the largest and smallest elements to calculate the difference. However, this approach does not always yield the maximum beauty. For instance, consider the input:

```
4
10 5 3 8
```

The program would sort the array to `[3, 5, 8, 10]` and then calculate the beauty as `(10-3) + (8-5) = 7 + 3 = 10`. However, the optimal arrangement could be `[5, 10, 3, 8]`, which gives a beauty of `(10-5) + (8-3) = 5 + 5 = 10`.

To correctly solve this problem, Sasha needs to rearrange the array such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. This requires a different approach, such as sorting the array and then pairing the smallest and largest elements appropriately.
