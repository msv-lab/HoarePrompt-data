Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `len(a) // 2`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < len(a) // 2`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ntest` is an input integer.
   - `itest` is `ntest`.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order and its length must be at least 2.
   - `kq` is `sum(a) - 2 * a[0] + a[len(a) - 1] - a[1]`.
   - `i` is 2.

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(a) // 2`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` should be incremented by 1 (from 2 to 3).
   - `len(a) // 2` remains unchanged because it is determined by the length of the list `a`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `ntest` is an input integer.
- `itest` is `ntest`.
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order and its length must be at least 2.
- `kq` is `sum(a) - 2 * a[0] + a[len(a) - 1] - a[1]`.
- `i` is 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`ntest` is an input integer, `itest` is `ntest`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order and its length must be at least 2, `kq` is `sum(a) - 2 * a[0] + a[len(a) - 1] - a[1], `i` is 3**
