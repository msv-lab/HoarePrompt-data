Output State: **`b_d` is 30001, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is a string entered by the user, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by converting each character of `input_string` to its corresponding integer value, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is equal to `z`, `o_r` is equal to `o`, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 0, and `(o_r < (z_r + o_r) / 2)` is true.**

Explanation: The line `b_d = 30001` assigns the value 30001 to the variable `b_d`. All other variables retain their initial states as described in the initial state.
