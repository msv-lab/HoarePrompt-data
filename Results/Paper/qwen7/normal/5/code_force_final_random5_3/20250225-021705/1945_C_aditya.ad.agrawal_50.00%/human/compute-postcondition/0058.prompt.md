Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `b_d` is either 30001 or equal to `dist`, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is a string entered by the user, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by converting each character of `input_string` to its corresponding integer value, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is equal to `z`, `o_r` is equal to `o`, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 0. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to half of the total count of 0s and 1s (`(z_r + o_r) / 2`), then `b_d` is equal to `dist`. Otherwise, `b_d` is set to 30001.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    pos += 1
    if i == 0:
        z_l += 1
        z_r -= 1
    else:
        o_l += 1
        o_r -= 1
    if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 
        2 - pos):
        ans = pos
        b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the second element of `arr`, `pos` is 1, `z_r` is 1 if `i` is 0, or `o_r` is 1 if `i` is not 0, and the following conditions hold: `o_r` is greater than or equal to half of the sum of `z_r` and `o_r`, `z_l` is greater than or equal to half of the sum of `z_l` and `o_l`, and `b_d` is 0; `ans` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `pos` is 3, `z_r` and `o_r` are updated based on the value of `i`, `z_l` and `o_l` are updated accordingly, `b_d` is 1, and `ans` is 3. If `i` is 0, then `z_r` remains unchanged (or becomes 0), `o_r` becomes 1, and `z_l` is increased by 1. If `i` is not 0, then `z_r` becomes 1, `o_r` remains unchanged (or becomes 0), and `o_l` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the fifth element of `arr`, `pos` is 5, `z_r` is either 4 or one less than its original value, `o_r` is updated accordingly, `z_l` is 6, `o_l` are updated accordingly, `b_d` is 3, and `ans` is 5 if the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))` is true, otherwise `ans` remains 4.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
