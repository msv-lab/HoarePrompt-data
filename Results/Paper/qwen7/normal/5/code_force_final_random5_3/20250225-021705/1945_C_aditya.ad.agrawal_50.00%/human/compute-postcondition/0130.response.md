Output State: **`dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `o_r` is `o`, `z_l` is 0, `z_r` is `z`, `n` is an input integer, and `input_string` is the input read from the user.**

Explanation: The code initializes `dist`, `ans`, and `pos` with the values `abs(n / 2)`, `0`, and `0` respectively. The values of `o_l`, `o_r`, `z_l`, `z_r`, `n`, and `input_string` remain unchanged from their initial states.
