Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `pos` is 3, `z_r` is 0, `o_r` is 1 if `i` is not 0, and the following conditions hold: `o_r` ≥ (1/2) * (z_r + o_r), `z_l` ≥ (1/2) * (z_l + o_l), and `b_d` is 0; `ans` is 1; `z_l` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: 
- The value of `z_r` is decreased by 1, so `z_r` becomes 0.
- The value of `i` is unchanged, so `i` remains the third element of `arr`.
- The value of `o_r` depends on the value of `i`. If `i` is not 0, then `o_r` remains 1; otherwise, `o_r` would be 0, but since `i` is not specified to be 0, `o_r` remains 1.
- The conditions `o_r` ≥ (1/2) * (z_r + o_r) and `z_l` ≥ (1/2) * (z_l + o_l) remain valid.
- The value of `b_d` is unchanged, so `b_d` is 0.
- The value of `ans` is unchanged, so `ans` is 1.
- The value of `z_l` is increased by 1, so `z_l` is now one more than its previous value.
