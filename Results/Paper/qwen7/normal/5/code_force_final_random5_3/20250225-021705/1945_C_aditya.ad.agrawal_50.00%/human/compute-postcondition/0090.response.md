Output State: **`i` is the first element of `arr`, `pos` is 2, `o_l` is 0 more than its original value, `o_r` is 1 less than its original value, `z_l` is 0 if `i` equals 0, otherwise `z_l` retains its original value, `ans` is 2, `b_d` is the absolute value of `n / 2 - 2`**.

This means that the value of `b_d` is calculated as the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `pos` (which is 2), but the actual value of `n` remains unknown. The other variables retain their original conditions or values as described in the initial state.
