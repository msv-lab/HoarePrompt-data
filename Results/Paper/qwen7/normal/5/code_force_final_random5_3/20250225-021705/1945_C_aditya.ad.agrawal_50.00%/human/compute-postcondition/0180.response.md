Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` will be 0 because it is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. `pos` will be the length of the final `arr` since it is incremented in each iteration of the inner for loop. `o_r` will be 0 because all 1s in `arr` are processed and `o_r` is reset to 0 at the start of each new input's processing. Similarly, `z_r` will be 0 because all 0s in `arr` are processed and `z_r` is reset to 0 at the start of each new input's processing. `o_l` will be the total count of 1s in the final `arr` because it accumulates the count of 1s from the start of the loop. `z_l` will be the total count of 0s in the final `arr` because it accumulates the count of 0s from the start of the loop. `b_d` will be the minimum absolute difference between `n / 2` and any position that meets the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` during the entire loop execution. `ans` will be the position that minimizes the distance to `n/2` while satisfying the conditions `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2`. All these values are derived from the last input processed by the loop.
