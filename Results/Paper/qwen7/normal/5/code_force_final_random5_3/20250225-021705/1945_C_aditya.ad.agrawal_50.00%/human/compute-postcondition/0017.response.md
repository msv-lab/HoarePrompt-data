Postcondition: **`b_d` is either 30001 or equal to `dist`, `t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is a string entered by the user, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by converting each character of `input_string` to its corresponding integer value, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is equal to `z`, `o_r` is equal to `o`, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 0. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to half of the total count of 0s and 1s (`(z_r + o_r) / 2`), then `b_d` is equal to `dist`. Otherwise, `b_d` is set to 30001.**
