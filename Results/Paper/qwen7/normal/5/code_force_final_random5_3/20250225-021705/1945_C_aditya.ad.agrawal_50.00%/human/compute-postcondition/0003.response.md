Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is a string entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `input_string = input()` takes a string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `input_string`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged as they were in the initial state.
