Output State: **`dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `o_r` is `o`, `z_l` is 0, `z_r` is `z`, `b_d` is `abs(n / 2)`**.

The code assigns the value of `dist` to `b_d`. Since `dist` is initially `abs(n / 2)`, `b_d` is also set to `abs(n / 2)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
