Output State: **`input_string` is a string read from input, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a character from `input_string` converted to its ASCII value, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`.**

Explanation: The code `o = arr.count(1)` counts the number of occurrences of the integer 1 in the list `arr` and assigns this count to the variable `o`. The values of `input_string`, `arr`, and `z` remain unchanged from their initial state.
