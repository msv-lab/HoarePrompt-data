Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is a string entered by the user, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by converting each character of `input_string` to its corresponding integer value, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is equal to `z`, `o_r` is equal to `o`**.

The code simply assigns the current value of `o` to `o_r`. This does not change any of the existing values of the variables. Therefore, the counts of 0s (`z`) and 1s (`o`) in the list `arr` remain unchanged, and the variables `z_r` and `o_r` are updated to reflect the current counts of 0s and 1s respectively.
