Output State: **`i` is the second element of `arr`, `pos` is 4, `o_l` is 1, `o_r` is 1 less than its original value, `z_l` is 0 if `i` equals 0, otherwise `z_l` retains its original value, `ans` is 2, `b_d` is the absolute value of `n / 2 - 2`**

Explanation:
- The code `o_l += 1` increments the value of `o_l` by 1. Since `o_l` was originally 0 more than its original value, it now becomes 1.
- The other variables (`i`, `pos`, `o_r`, `z_l`, `ans`, and `b_d`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
