Output State: **`input_string` is a string read from input, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a character from `input_string` converted to its ASCII value, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is equal to `z`, `o_r` is equal to `o`, `z_l` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `z_l` to 0. This does not affect the values of `input_string`, `arr`, `z`, `o`, `z_r`, or `o_r`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous states, and only `z_l` is updated to 0.
