Output State: **`input_string` is a string read from input, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a character from `input_string` converted to its ASCII value, `z` is the count of 0s in `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in `arr`, `z_r` is equal to `z`, `o_r` is equal to `o`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `o_r = o` simply assigns the current value of `o` to `o_r`. No other changes are made to the variables. Therefore, the counts of 0s (`z`) and 1s (`o`) remain unchanged, and `z_r` and `o_r` reflect the current values of `z` and `o`, respectively.
