Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the second element of `arr`, `pos` is 1, and `o_l` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `o_l += 1` increments the value of `o_l` by 1. Initially, `o_l` was not specified, but since it is incremented by 1, its new value is 2. All other variables (`arr`, `i`, and `pos`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
