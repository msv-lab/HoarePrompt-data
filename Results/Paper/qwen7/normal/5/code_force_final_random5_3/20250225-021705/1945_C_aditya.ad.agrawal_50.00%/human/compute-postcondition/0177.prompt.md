Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Postcondition: `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `o_r` is `o`, `z_l` is 0, `z_r` is `z`, `b_d` is either `abs(n / 2)` or 30001 depending on whether `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` is true or false.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    pos += 1
    if i == 0:
        z_l += 1
        z_r -= 1
    else:
        o_l += 1
        o_r -= 1
    if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 
        2 - pos):
        ans = pos
        b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is the second element of `arr`, `pos` is 1, `o_l` is 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `ans` is 1, and `b_d` is 0. This is because if the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))` is true, then `z_r` is set to 0, `o_l` remains 1, `i` is not equal to 0, `ans` is set to 1, and `b_d` is set to 0. Since there is no else part, these assignments hold regardless of the condition's truth value.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is the fourth element of `arr`, `pos` is 1, `b_d` is the absolute value of `n / 2 - 1`. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to half of `(z_r + o_r)` and `z_l` is greater than or equal to half of `(z_l + o_l)` and `b_d` is greater than the absolute value of `n / 2 - pos`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, the values of `z_r` and `o_r` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `pos` is 2, `i` will be the fifth element of `arr`, `b_d` is 1, `o_r` and `o_l` are each decreased by 1 if `i` is not 0, otherwise `z_r` is decreased by 1, `z_r` and `z_l` remain unchanged, `ans` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
