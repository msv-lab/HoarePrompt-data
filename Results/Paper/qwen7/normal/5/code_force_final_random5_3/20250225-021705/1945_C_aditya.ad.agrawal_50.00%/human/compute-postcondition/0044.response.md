Postcondition: `arr` is a non-empty list of integers, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `pos` is 3, `z_r` and `o_r` are updated based on the value of `i`, `z_l` and `o_l` are updated accordingly, `b_d` is 0, and `ans` is 1. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to half of `(z_r + o_r)` and `z_l` is greater than or equal to half of `(z_l + o_l)` and `b_d` is greater than the absolute difference between `n/2` and `pos`, then `z_r` and `o_r` are updated based on the value of `i`, `z_l` is increased by 1 if `i` is 0, otherwise `o_l` is increased by 1, and `b_d` remains 0, `ans` remains 1. If any of these conditions are not met, `b_d` becomes 1 and `ans` becomes 3.
