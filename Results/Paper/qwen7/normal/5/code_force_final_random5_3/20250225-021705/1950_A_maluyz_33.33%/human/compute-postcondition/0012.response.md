Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `i` is 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers.
- The condition `a >= b` or `b >= c` holds true.
- `max(a, b, c) != b`.

The print statement is simply:

```python
print('NONE')
```

This statement will print the string `'NONE'` regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Output: **NONE**
