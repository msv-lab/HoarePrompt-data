You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be exactly equal to the number of iterations the loop has executed, `i` is now `t-1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the last set of integers input by the user during the final iteration of the loop. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split. Depending on the conditions met in the loop, the output printed during each iteration will be either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE'. After all iterations, the loop will have processed `t` sets of inputs, and the final values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will reflect the most recent input provided by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` sets of three integers (`a`, `b`, and `c`) and prints one of three possible outputs ('STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE') for each set based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. After processing all sets, the final values of `a`, `b`, and `c` represent the last set of integers input by the user. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the middle digit `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`, which would satisfy the peak condition `a < b > c`. For example, if the input is `3 4 1`, the program incorrectly outputs `PEAK` instead of `STAIR`. This is because the condition `max(a, b, c) == b` is not sufficient to determine a peak; it should check if `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`.

To fix this, the program should explicitly check if `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif b > a and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

With this correction, the program will correctly identify all cases as either "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE".
