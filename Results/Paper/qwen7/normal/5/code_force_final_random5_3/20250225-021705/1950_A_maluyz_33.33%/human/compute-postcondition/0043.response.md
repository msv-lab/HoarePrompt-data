Functionality: **The function processes `t` sets of three integers (`a`, `b`, and `c`) and prints one of three possible outputs ('STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE') for each set based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. After processing all sets, the final values of `a`, `b`, and `c` represent the last set of integers input by the user. The function does not return any value.**
