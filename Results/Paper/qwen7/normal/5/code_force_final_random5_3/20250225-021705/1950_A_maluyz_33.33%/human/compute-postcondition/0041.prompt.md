Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, and `t` is now equal to the integer input from the user.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    if a < b < c:
        print('STAIR')
    elif a == b == c:
        print('NONE')
    elif max(a, b, c) == b:
        print('PEAK')
    else:
        print('NONE')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer. If `a < b < c` holds true, then the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the condition `a >= b` or `b >= c` holds true. Additionally, if `a == b == c`, then `a`, `b`, and `c` are all equal. Otherwise, the maximum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is either equal to `b` or not equal to `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer, `c` is the third input integer. If `a` is less than `b` which is less than `c`, then the maximum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is assigned to a variable. Otherwise, the maximum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is assigned to a variable.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer, `c` is the third input integer, `a`, `b`, and `c` are converted integers from the input split. If `a < b < c`, then the maximum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is `c`. Otherwise, the maximum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
