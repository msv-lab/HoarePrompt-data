Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer, `c` is the third input integer. If `a` is less than `b` which is less than `c`, then the maximum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is assigned to a variable. Otherwise, the maximum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is assigned to a variable.**
