Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(t):` statement. The variables involved here are `i` and `t`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `a` is the first input integer.
   - `b` is the second input integer.
   - `c` is the third input integer.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `t`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 1 and `t` must be greater than 0, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2, and `t` must remain greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` needs to be incremented from 1 to 2.
   - `t` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer, `c` is the third input integer.**
