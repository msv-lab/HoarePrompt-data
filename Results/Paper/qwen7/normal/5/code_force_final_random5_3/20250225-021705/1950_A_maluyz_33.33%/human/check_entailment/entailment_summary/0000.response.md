Reasoning:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
- It then iterates over each test case, reading three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` for each case.
- The conditions for determining whether the numbers form a stair, a peak, or neither are correctly implemented:
  - `if a < b < c:` checks for a stair.
  - `elif a == b == c:` checks for the case where all three numbers are equal, which should result in "NONE".
  - `elif max(a, b, c) == b:` checks for a peak, where `b` is the maximum value.
  - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "NONE".
- The logic handles all given examples correctly:
  - For `1 2 3`, it prints "STAIR".
  - For `3 2 1`, it prints "NONE".
  - For `1 5 3`, it prints "PEAK".
  - For `3 4 1`, it prints "PEAK".
  - For `0 0 0`, it prints "NONE".
  - For `4 1 7`, it prints "NONE".
  - For `4 5 7`, it prints "STAIR".

Given that the program correctly implements the logic and handles all test cases as expected, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
