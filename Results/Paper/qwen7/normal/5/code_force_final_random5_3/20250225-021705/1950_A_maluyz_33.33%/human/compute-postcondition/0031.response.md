Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer, `c` is the third input integer, `a`, `b`, and `c` are converted integers from the input split.**

The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and converts them to integers, assigning them to `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively. The initial conditions for `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
