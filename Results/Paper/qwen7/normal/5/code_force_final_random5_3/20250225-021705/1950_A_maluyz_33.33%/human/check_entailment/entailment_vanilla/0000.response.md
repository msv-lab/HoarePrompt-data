Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a "stair".
   - If `a == b == c`, it prints "NONE". This condition is unnecessary because it does not affect the stair or peak conditions.
   - It checks if `max(a, b, c) == b` to determine if the digits form a "peak". However, this condition alone is not sufficient because it does not account for the order of `a` and `c` relative to `b`.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "NONE".

### Detailed Explanation:

- **Stair Condition (`a < b < c`):**
  - The program correctly identifies this condition using `if a < b < c`.

- **Peak Condition:**
  - The program incorrectly uses `elif max(a, b, c) == b` to check for a peak. This condition is insufficient because it only checks if `b` is the maximum value, but it does not ensure that `a > b` and `c > b`.

- **Other Conditions:**
  - The program handles the "none" case correctly when no other conditions are met.

### Example Test Cases:

1. **Test Case: `1 2 3`**
   - `a < b < c` is true, so it should print "STAIR".
   - The program prints "STAIR".

2. **Test Case: `3 2 1`**
   - `a < b < c` is false, `a == b == c` is false, and `max(a, b, c) == b` is false, so it should print "NONE".
   - The program prints "NONE".

3. **Test Case: `1 5 3`**
   - `a < b < c` is false, `a == b == c` is false, and `max(a, b, c) == b` is true, so it should print "PEAK".
   - The program prints "PEAK".

4. **Test Case: `3 4 1`**
   - `a < b < c` is false, `a == b == c` is false, and `max(a, b, c) == b` is true, so it should print "PEAK".
   - The program prints "PEAK".

5. **Test Case: `0 0 0`**
   - `a < b < c` is false, `a == b == c` is true, so it should print "NONE".
   - The program prints "NONE".

6. **Test Case: `4 1 7`**
   - `a < b < c` is false, `a == b == c` is false, and `max(a, b, c) == b` is false, so it should print "NONE".
   - The program prints "NONE".

7. **Test Case: `4 5 7`**
   - `a < b < c` is false, `a == b == c` is false, and `max(a, b, c) == b` is false, so it should print "STAIR".
   - The program prints "STAIR".

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly identify peaks because it only checks if `b` is the maximum value, which is not sufficient. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
