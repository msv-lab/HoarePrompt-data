Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are converted integers from the input split.

The print statement is simply `print('NONE')`.

Since the print statement is explicitly printing the string `'NONE'`, regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, the output will be exactly as specified.

Output: **NONE**
