Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the middle digit `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`, which would satisfy the peak condition `a < b > c`. For example, if the input is `3 4 1`, the program incorrectly outputs `PEAK` instead of `STAIR`. This is because the condition `max(a, b, c) == b` is not sufficient to determine a peak; it should check if `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`.

To fix this, the program should explicitly check if `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif b > a and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

With this correction, the program will correctly identify all cases as either "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE".
