Output State: **`i` is 4, `rem` is `k - i - 1`, `ptsb` contains the value `preb[4] + rem * b[4]`, `ptss` contains the value `pres[4] + rem * s[4]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `rem` to `k - (i + 1)`. Given that `i` is initially 4, `rem` is updated to `k - 5 - 1` which simplifies to `k - i - 1`. The values of `i`, `ptsb`, and `ptss` remain unchanged from their initial states.
