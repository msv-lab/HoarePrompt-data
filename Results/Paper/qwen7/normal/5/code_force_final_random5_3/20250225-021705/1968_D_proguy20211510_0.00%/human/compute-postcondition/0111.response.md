Output State: **`founds` is True, `i` is either 4 or 2, `k` is greater than `i + 1`, `b` is a list with elements `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and either `maxa` or `a[pb - 1]` depending on whether `foundb` is true or false, `s` is a list with an element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `foundb` is True if `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, otherwise `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`**.

Explanation: The line `founds = True` sets the variable `founds` to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated state includes `founds` being set to `True`, while `i`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `foundb`, and `pb` retain their original conditions and values as described in the initial state.
