Output State: **`foundb` is True, `founds` is True if `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`, otherwise it can be either True or False, `b` now contains `b + [(k - (i + 1)) * maxa] + [a[pb - 1]], `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`, `maxa` remains unchanged, `s` now contains `s + [(k - (i + 1)) * maxa]` if `a[ps - 1]` does not equal `maxa`, otherwise `s` contains `s + [maxa]` or `s + [a[ps - 1]]`, and `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1]` does not equal `maxa`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken.**

Explanation: The code `b.append(a[pb - 1])` appends the value of `a[pb - 1]` to the list `b`. Given the initial conditions, `b` was previously `b + [(k - (i + 1)) * maxa]`, so after appending `a[pb - 1]`, `b` becomes `b + [(k - (i + 1)) * maxa] + [a[pb - 1]]`. The other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state description.
