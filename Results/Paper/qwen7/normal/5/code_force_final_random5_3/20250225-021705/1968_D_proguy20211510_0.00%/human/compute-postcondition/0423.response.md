Output State: **`preb` is a list containing the value `sb + b[i] + b[i-1]` and `sb + b[i] + b[i-1] + b[i-1]`, `sb` is `sb + b[i]`, `ss` is `ss + s[i] + s[i-1]`, `s` is a non-empty list, `len(s)` is greater than 0, `i` is `i_prev + 2`, `pres` is a list containing one additional element `ss + s[i]`**.

Explanation: The code `ss += s[i]` increments `ss` by the value of `s[i]`. Since `i` is `i_prev + 2`, `ss` now includes the contribution of `s[i-1]` from the previous iteration plus the current `s[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
