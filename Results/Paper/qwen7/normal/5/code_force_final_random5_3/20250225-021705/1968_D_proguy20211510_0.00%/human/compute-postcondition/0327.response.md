Output State: **`i` is less than `k`, `k` is an integer, `foundb` and `founds` are True, `b` contains an additional element which is ((`k` - (`i` + 1)) * `maxa`).**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `b`. The element is calculated as (`k` - (`i` + 1)) * `maxa`. Since `i` must be less than `k`, the subtraction (`k` - (`i` + 1)) will yield a positive integer. The value of `maxa` remains unchanged. The variables `foundb` and `founds` remain True as they were not affected by the code.
