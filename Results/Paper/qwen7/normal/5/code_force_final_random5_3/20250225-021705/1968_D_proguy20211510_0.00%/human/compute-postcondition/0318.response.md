Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(pres)`, `rem` is 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `ptsb` is not yet calculated, `ptss` is not yet calculated, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.split(), `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`. We continue the loop or statement we were inside.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the additional information that the loop or statement continues.
