Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is an integer value of the original `k` string, `b` contains the element `(k - (0 + 1)) * maxa`, `s` contains the element `(k - (1 + 1)) * maxa`, and both `foundb` and `founds` are True.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` to the list `s`. Initially, `i` is 1. After executing the code, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 2. The value of `k` remains unchanged as it is an integer value of the original `k` string. The value of `b` remains unchanged as it was defined before and is not affected by this operation. The new value appended to `s` is `(k - (1 + 1)) * maxa`, which simplifies to `(k - 2) * maxa`. The states of `foundb` and `founds` remain True.
