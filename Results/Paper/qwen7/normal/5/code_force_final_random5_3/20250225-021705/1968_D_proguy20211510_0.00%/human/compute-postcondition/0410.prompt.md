Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is equal to `len(pres)`, `rem` is 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `ptsb` is not yet calculated, `ptss` is not yet calculated, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.split(), `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `b` is an empty list, `s` is an empty list, `founds` is `False`, `foundb` is `False`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if foundb and founds:
        b.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        s.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        break
    if foundb:
        b.append(maxa)
    elif a[pb - 1] == maxa:
        foundb = True
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
    else:
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
        pb = p[pb - 1]
    if founds:
        s.append(maxa)
    elif a[ps - 1] == maxa:
        founds = True
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
    else:
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
        ps = p[ps - 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is less than `k`, `k` is an integer, `foundb` is True, `founds` is True if `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`, otherwise it can be either True or False, `b` contains the value `maxa` (which is equal to `a[pb - 1]`), `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`, `maxa` remains unchanged, `s` contains the value `maxa` if `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`, otherwise `s` contains `a[ps - 1]`, and `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1]` does not equal `maxa`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is less than `k`, `foundb` is True, `founds` is True if `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`, otherwise it can be either True or False, `b` now contains the value `b + [maxa] + [(k - (i + 1)) * maxa] + [(k - (i + 1)) * maxa]` or `b + [(k - (i + 1)) * maxa] + [(k - (i + 1)) * maxa] + [a[pb - 1]]`, `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`, `maxa` remains unchanged, `s` now contains `s + [maxa]` if `a[ps - 1]` does not equal `maxa`, otherwise `s` contains `s + [maxa]` or `s + [a[ps - 1]]`, and `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1]` does not equal `maxa`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is less than `k`, `foundb` is True, `founds` is True if `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`, otherwise it can be either True or False, `b` now contains the value `b + [(k - (i + 1)) * maxa] + [maxa]` or `b + [(k - (i + 1)) * maxa] + [a[pb - 1]]`, `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`, `maxa` remains unchanged, `s` now contains `s + [maxa]` if `a[ps - 1]` does not equal `maxa`, otherwise `s` contains `s + [maxa]` or `s + [a[ps - 1]]`, and `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1]` does not equal `maxa`, and `s` is appended with `maxa` or `s` contains `s + [a[ps - 1]]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
