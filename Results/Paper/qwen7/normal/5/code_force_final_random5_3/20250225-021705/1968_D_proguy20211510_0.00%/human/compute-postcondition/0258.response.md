Postcondition: **`founds` remains `True`, `i` is `length_of_pres + 2`, `rem` is `k - len(pres) - 2`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` remain unchanged, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `input().split()`, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `b` is a list containing either three or four elements with the last element being `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `s` is a list with the element `a[ps - 1]` appended. If `a[ps - 1]` is the maximum value in `a`, `b` has the additional element `a[ps - 1]`; otherwise, `b` has the additional element `p[ps - 1]`.**
