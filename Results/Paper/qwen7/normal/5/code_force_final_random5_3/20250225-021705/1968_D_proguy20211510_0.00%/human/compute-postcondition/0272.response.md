Output State: **`preb` has its last element updated to `sb + b[i]`, `sb` is now equal to `sb + b[i]`, `pres` has the new element `ss + s[i]`, `ss` is now equal to `ss + s[i]`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `preb` has a new element `sb + b[i]` with `ss += s[i]` updating `ss` to `ss + s[i]`**.

This means that the value of `ss` is incremented by `s[i]`. All other variables and their relationships remain unchanged from the initial state except for `ss`, which now holds the value of its previous value plus `s[i]`.
