Output State: **`i` is `len(pres)`, `rem` is `k - len(pres) - 1`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer.**

Explanation: The code snippet converts the variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` from strings to integers. The values of `i` and `rem` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `i` is still `len(pres)`, and `rem` is still `k - len(pres) - 1`. The variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are now integers.
