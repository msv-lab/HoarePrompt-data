Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `preb` includes the appended value `sb + b[i + 1]` and now equals `sb + b[i + 1]`, `pres` includes the appended value `ss + s[i]` and now equals `ss + s[i]`, `ss` is `ss + s[i]`**

Explanation: The code `ss += s[i]` increments the value of `ss` by adding the value of `s[i]` to it. The other variables (`i`, `preb`, and `pres`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
