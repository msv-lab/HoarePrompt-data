Postcondition: **`i` is less than `k`, `foundb` is True, `founds` is True if `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`, otherwise it can be either True or False, `b` now contains the value `b + [(k - (i + 1)) * maxa]`, `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`, `maxa` remains unchanged, `s` now contains `s + [(k - (i + 1)) * maxa]` if `a[ps - 1]` does not equal `maxa`, otherwise `s` contains `s + [maxa]` or `s + [a[ps - 1]]`, and `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1]` does not equal `maxa`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken.**
