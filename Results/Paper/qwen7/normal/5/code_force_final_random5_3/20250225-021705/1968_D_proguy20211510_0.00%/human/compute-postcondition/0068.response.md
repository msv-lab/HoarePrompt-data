Postcondition: `i` is 2 or 0, `k` is an integer value of the original `k` string, `b` contains the elements `(k - 1) * maxa` and optionally `a[pb - 1]` depending on the condition, `s` contains the elements `(k - 2) * maxa` and possibly `a[ps - 1]`, `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]` if `a[pb - 1] != maxa`, `foundb` is False or `founds` is True, and `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1] != maxa`.
