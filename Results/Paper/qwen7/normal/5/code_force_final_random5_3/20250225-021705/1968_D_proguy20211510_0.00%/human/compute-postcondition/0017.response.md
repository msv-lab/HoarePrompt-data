Output State: **`n` is an integer value of the original `n` string, `k` is an integer value of the original `k` string, `pb` is an integer value of the original `pb` string, `ps` is an integer value of the original `ps` string, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `p`. Additionally, `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa` and `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `a[ps - 1]` or at least one of them is not equal to `maxa`. We continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables within the scope of the `continue` statement, the values of all variables remain the same as they were before the `continue` statement was executed.
