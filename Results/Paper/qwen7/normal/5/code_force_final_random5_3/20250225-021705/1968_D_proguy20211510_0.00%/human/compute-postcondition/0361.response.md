Output State: **`i` is less than `k`, `k` is an integer, `foundb` is True, `founds` is False, `b` contains the value `maxa`, `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`, `maxa` remains unchanged, `a[ps - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, `s` contains the value `a[ps - 1]`, `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]`**.

The code `ps = p[ps - 1]` updates the value of `ps` to the value of `p[ps - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
