Output State: **`i` is `len(pres)`, `rem` is `k - len(pres) - 1`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.split()**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes user input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`. The values of `i`, `rem`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, and `p` remain unchanged from their initial states.
