Output State: **`preb` contains the sum of `sb + b[i]` for each iteration from 0 to `k-1`, `sb` is the cumulative sum of `b[i]` from 0 to `k-1`, `pres` contains the sum of `ss + s[i]` for each iteration from 0 to `k-1`, and `ss` is the cumulative sum of `s[i]` from 0 to `k-1`.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `preb` will contain the cumulative sums of `b[i]` added to the previous value in `preb` for each index `i` from 0 to `k-1`. Similarly, `sb` will hold the total sum of all elements in `b`. The list `pres` will include the cumulative sums of `s[i]` added to the previous value in `pres` for each index `i` from 0 to `k-1`, and `ss` will hold the total sum of all elements in `s`.
