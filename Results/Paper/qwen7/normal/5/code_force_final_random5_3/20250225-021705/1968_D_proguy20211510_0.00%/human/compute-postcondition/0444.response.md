Output State: **`rem` is `k - 6`, `i` is 4, `ptsb` contains the value `preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0] + preb[4] + (k - 4 - 1) * b[4] + preb[4] + (k - 4 - 1) * b[4]`, `ptss` contains the value `pres[1] + (k - 1) * s[1] + pres[4] + (k - 4 - 1) * s[4]`**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `rem` is `k - i - 2`, which simplifies to `k - 4 - 2` or `k - 6`.
- `i` remains 4 since the code does not change its value.
- `ptsb` originally contains the value `preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0] + preb[4] + (k - 4 - 1) * b[4]`. After executing `ptsb.append(preb[i] + rem * b[i])`, it appends `preb[4] + (k - 6) * b[4]` to `ptsb`. Therefore, the new value of `ptsb` is the original value plus `preb[4] + (k - 4 - 1) * b[4]`.
- `ptss` remains unchanged as the code only affects `ptsb`.

Thus, the updated values are as stated above.
