Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is 2
- `rem` is `k - 1`
- `ptsb` contains the value `preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0]`
- `ptss` contains the value `pres[1] + (k - 1) * s[1]`

### Loop Head
```
for i in range(len(pres)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for each index `i` in the range from `0` to `len(pres) - 1`.
2. **Current Value of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `i = 3`.

### Adjusting the States
- **Variable `i`**: It needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.
- **Variables `rem`, `ptsb`, and `ptss`**: These variables are not directly affected by the loop condition and remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them. Since no modifications are mentioned in the loop body, these variables stay as they are.

### Final State
State: **`i` is 3, `rem` is `k - 1`, `ptsb` contains the value `preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0]`, `ptss` contains the value `pres[1] + (k - 1) * s[1]`**
