Output State: **`founds` and `foundb` remain `True`, `i` is `length_of_pres + 2`, `rem` is `k - len(pres) - 2`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` remain unchanged, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from `input().split()`, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `b` is a list containing either three or four elements with the last element being `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `s` is a list containing the maximum value in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `s.append(maxa)` appends the maximum value in the list `a` to the list `s`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
