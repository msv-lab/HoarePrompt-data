Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(pres)`, `rem` is 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `ptsb` is not yet calculated, `ptss` is not yet calculated, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`.**

Explanation: The code snippet assigns `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` to their respective integer values from the input. However, since the initial values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are not specified, they remain as integers. The other variables (`rem`, `pres`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, `maxb`) are not affected by this code snippet, so they retain their initial states.
