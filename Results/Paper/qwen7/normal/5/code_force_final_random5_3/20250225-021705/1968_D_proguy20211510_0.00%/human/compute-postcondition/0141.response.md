Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(len(pres))`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i = 0` and increments `i` until `i < len(pres)`. Therefore, `i` must be initialized to 0 for the loop to start executing.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue as long as `i < len(pres)`. This means that `i` must be less than the length of `pres` for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `preb` is a list containing the sum of `sb + b[i]` for each index `i` from 0 to `len(s) - 1`.
- `pres` is a list containing the sum of `ss + s[i]` for each index `i` from 0 to `len(s) - 1`.
- `sb` is equal to `sb + b[i]` where `i` is the last index of `s`.
- `ss` is equal to `ss + s[i]` where `i` is the last index of `s`.
- `ptsb` is an empty list.
- `ptss` is an empty list.

Since the loop depends on the length of `pres`, we need to ensure that `i` is initialized to 0 and that `i` is less than the length of `pres` for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` must be 0.
- `i` must be less than the length of `pres`.

The final state should be:
**`i` is 0, `i` must be less than the length of `pres`**.

So, the answer is:
State: **`i` is 0, `i` must be less than the length of `pres`**
