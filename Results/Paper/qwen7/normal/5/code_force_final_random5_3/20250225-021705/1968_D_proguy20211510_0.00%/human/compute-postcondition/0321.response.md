Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `len(pres)`, `rem` is 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `ptsb` is not yet calculated, `ptss` is not yet calculated, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.split(), `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`. If `a[pb - 1]` equals `maxa`, then either `pb` is decremented or the loop continues. If `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`, then either `ps` is decremented or the loop continues.**
