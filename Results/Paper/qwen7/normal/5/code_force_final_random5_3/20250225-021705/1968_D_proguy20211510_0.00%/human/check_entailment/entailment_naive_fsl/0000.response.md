Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game for all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not handle the scenario where both players can potentially end up with the same maximum score after k turns. Let's consider a specific example to illustrate this:

### Example Case
- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  4 2 3 2
  4 1 2 3
  7 2 5 6
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  - Bodya starts at position 3, Sasha starts at position 2.
  - After the first turn:
    - Bodya's score: \(a_3 = 5\)
    - Bodya moves to position 3 (since \(p_3 = 3\)).
    - Sasha's score: \(a_2 = 2\)
    - Sasha moves to position 1 (since \(p_2 = 1\)).
  - After the second turn:
    - Bodya's score: \(5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10\)
    - Sasha's score: \(2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9\)

  The final scores are:
  - Bodya: 10
  - Sasha: 9

  Therefore, Bodya wins.

However, the program incorrectly handles this scenario. Here is how the program processes the example:

- The program checks if the initial scores of both players are equal to the maximum value in the array `a`. In this case, it does not check the subsequent moves and simply prints the result based on the initial comparison.

Given the above example, the program fails to simulate the game correctly for all potential cases, as it does not account for the dynamic changes in scores during the game. Hence, the program is incorrect.
