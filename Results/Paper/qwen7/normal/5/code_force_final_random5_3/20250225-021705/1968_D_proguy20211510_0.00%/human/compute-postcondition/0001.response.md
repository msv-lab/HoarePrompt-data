Output State: **t is a positive integer, n, k, P_B, P_S are positive integers, p is a permutation of length n, a is an array of positive integers, MOD is 1000000007, YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO'**.

The code initializes the variable `MOD` with the value `10 ** 9 + 7`, which is a constant used for modular arithmetic to prevent overflow. This does not affect the values of the other variables, so they remain as initially stated.
