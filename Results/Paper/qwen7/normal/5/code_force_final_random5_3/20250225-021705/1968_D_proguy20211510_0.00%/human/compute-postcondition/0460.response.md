Postcondition: `rem` is `k - len(pres)`, `i` is `len(pres)`, `ptsb` is the cumulative sum of `preb[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * b[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `len(pres) - 1`, `ptss` is the cumulative sum of `pres[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * s[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `len(pres) - 1`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, and either `maxs < maxb` or `maxs >= maxb` holds true.
