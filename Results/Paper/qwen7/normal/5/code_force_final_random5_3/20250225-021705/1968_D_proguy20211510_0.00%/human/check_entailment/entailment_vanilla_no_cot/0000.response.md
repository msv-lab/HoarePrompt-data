Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly determining the winner of the game for all cases. Here are the key problems:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Moves**: The logic for determining the moves of Bodya and Sasha is flawed. The solution assumes that the players will always choose the maximum value in `a` to maximize their scores, which is not necessarily true. The players can choose to stay at their current position or move to `p[x]` based on the rules of the game.

2. **Inadequate Strategy Calculation**: The solution does not fully consider the strategic choices of the players. It only checks if the initial scores are equal to the maximum value in `a` and then makes assumptions about the rest of the game, which is not sufficient.

3. **Incomplete Game Simulation**: The solution does not simulate the entire game for `k` turns. Instead, it makes assumptions about the final scores without considering the dynamic nature of the game.

To correctly solve this problem, one needs to simulate the game for `k` turns, considering all possible moves for both players at each step. This involves maintaining the current positions and scores for both players and updating them based on the rules of the game.

Here is a corrected approach:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k, pb, ps = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))

        # Initialize scores
        score_bodya = 0
        score_sasha = 0
        bodya_pos = pb - 1
        sasha_pos = ps - 1

        # Simulate the game for k turns
        for _ in range(k):
            score_bodya += a[bodya_pos]
            score_sasha += a[sasha_pos]

            # Update positions
            bodya_pos = p[bodya_pos] - 1
            sasha_pos = p[sasha_pos] - 1

        # Determine the winner
        if score_bodya > score_sasha:
            print("Bodya")
        elif score_sasha > score_bodya:
            print("Sasha")
        else:
            print("Draw")

func()
```

This approach correctly simulates the game for `k` turns and determines the winner based on the final scores.
