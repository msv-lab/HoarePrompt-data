Output State: **`founds` is `True`, `foundb` is `True`, `i` is `len(pres)`, `rem` is `k - len(pres) - 1`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.split(), `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `b` is a list containing one element which is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `s` is a list containing one element which is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `len(pres)` must be less than `k`**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` to the list `s`. Since `s` was initially an empty list, after appending, `s` now contains one element, which is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. All other variables remain unchanged.
