Output State: **`preb` is a list containing three elements: the first element is `sb + b[i+2] + b[i+1]`, the second element is `sb + b[i+1]`, and the third element is `sb + b[i+2] + b[i+1] + b[i]`; `pres` is a list containing two elements: the first element is `ss + s[i+2]`, and the second element is `ss + s[i+2] + s[i+1]`; `sb` is `sb + b[i+2] + b[i+1]`; `ss` is `ss + s[i+2] + s[i+1]`.**

Explanation: The code `preb.append(sb + b[i])` appends the value of `sb + b[i]` to the list `preb`. Given the initial state, `preb` initially contains two elements: `sb + b[i+2] + b[i+1]` and `sb + b[i+1]`. After appending `sb + b[i]`, `preb` now contains three elements: `sb + b[i+2] + b[i+1]`, `sb + b[i+1]`, and `sb + b[i+2] + b[i]`. The values of `pres`, `sb`, and `ss` remain unchanged.
