The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop context provided in the initial state, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables outside of a loop. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(pres)`, `rem` is 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `ptsb` is not yet calculated, `ptss` is not yet calculated, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.split(), `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`.**
