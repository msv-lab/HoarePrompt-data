Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(pres)`, `rem` is 0, `ptsb` contains the sum of `preb[i] + rem * b[i]` for each iteration from 0 to `len(pres)-1`, `ptss` contains the sum of `pres[i] + rem * s[i]` for each iteration from 0 to `len(pres)-1`, `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`, and `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `i` is already set to `len(pres)`.
- The variable `rem` is set to 0 because it is calculated as `k - (i + 1)`, and when `i` equals `len(pres)`, `rem` becomes `k - len(pres) - 1`, which is 0 if `k` is equal to `len(pres)`.
- The lists `ptsb` and `ptss` remain unchanged as they were accumulated during the loop iterations.
- The variables `maxs` and `maxb` are assigned the maximum values found in `ptss` and `ptsb`, respectively.
