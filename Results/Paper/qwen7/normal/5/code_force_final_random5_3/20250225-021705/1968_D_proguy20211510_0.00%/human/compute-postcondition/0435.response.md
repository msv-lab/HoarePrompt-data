Output State: **`rem` is `k - 1`, `i` is 1, `ptsb` contains the value `preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0]`**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `preb[i] + rem * b[i]` to the list `ptsb`. Given the initial state where `rem` is `k - (i + 1)` and `i` is 0, when `i` is incremented to 1, `rem` becomes `k - 1`. The value appended to `ptsb` is `preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
