Output State: **`i` is less than `k`, `foundb` is True, `founds` is True, `b` now contains the value `b + [maxa] + [(k - (i + 1)) * maxa] + [(k - (i + 1)) * maxa]` or `b + [(k - (i + 1)) * maxa] + [(k - (i + 1)) * maxa] + [a[pb - 1]]`, `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`, `maxa` remains unchanged, `s` contains the value `maxa` if `a[ps - 1]` equals `maxa`, otherwise `s` contains `a[ps - 1]`, and `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]` if `a[ps - 1]` does not equal `maxa`.**

Explanation: The line `founds = True` simply assigns the value `True` to the variable `founds`. Since the initial state already had `founds` as `True`, this assignment does not change the value of `founds`. All other variables remain in their previously described states.
