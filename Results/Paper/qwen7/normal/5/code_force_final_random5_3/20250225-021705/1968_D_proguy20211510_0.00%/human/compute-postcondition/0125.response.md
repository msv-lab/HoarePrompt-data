Output State: **`preb` is a list containing one element which is `sb + b[i]`, `pres` is an empty list, `sb` is `sb + b[i]`, `ss` is 0, `s` must be a non-empty list.**

Explanation: The code `sb += b[i]` increments the value of `sb` by `b[i]`. The other variables (`preb`, `pres`, `ss`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
