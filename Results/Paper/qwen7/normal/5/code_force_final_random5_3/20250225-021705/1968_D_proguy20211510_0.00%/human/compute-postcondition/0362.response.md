Postcondition: `i` is less than `k`, `k` is an integer, `foundb` is True, `b` contains the value `maxa` (which is equal to `a[pb - 1]`), `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`, `maxa` remains unchanged. If `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, then `founds` is True and `s` contains the value `maxa`. Otherwise, `founds` is False, `s` contains the value `a[ps - 1]`, and `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]`.
