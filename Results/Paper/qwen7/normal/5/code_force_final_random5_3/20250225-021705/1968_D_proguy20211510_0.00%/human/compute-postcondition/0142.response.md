Output State: **`i` is 0; `rem` is `k - 1`**

Explanation: The variable `i` is initially set to 0. The code `rem = k - (i + 1)` calculates the value of `rem` by subtracting `i + 1` from `k`. Since `i` is 0, `i + 1` is 1, so `rem` is `k - 1`. The condition that `i` must be less than the length of `pres` is still valid, but since no information about `pres` is given, we only update the values of `i` and `rem`.
