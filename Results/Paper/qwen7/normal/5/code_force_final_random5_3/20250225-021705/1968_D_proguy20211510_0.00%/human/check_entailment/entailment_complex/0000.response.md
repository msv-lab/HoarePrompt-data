Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the input for each test case, including the number of test cases (`t`), the dimensions of the game (`n`, `k`), and the starting positions (`P_B`, `P_S`).
2. The function correctly reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
3. The function handles the special case where both players' starting positions have the maximum value in `a`, leading to a draw.
4. The function simulates the game for `k` turns, calculating the scores for both players based on their positions and the values in `a`.
5. The function correctly updates the scores for both players, considering the maximum value in `a` and the permutation `p`.
6. The function compares the final scores of Sasha and Bodya and prints the appropriate result ("Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw").

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
