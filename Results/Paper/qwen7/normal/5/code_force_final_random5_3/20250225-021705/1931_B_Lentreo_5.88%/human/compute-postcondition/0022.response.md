Based on the initial state provided:

- The final value of `curr` is 0.
- Each element in `nums` that was not zero has been adjusted by subtracting the previous element in the list.
- No elements in `nums` contribute to the value of `curr` since it is now 0.

The `print('YES')` statement will simply print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
