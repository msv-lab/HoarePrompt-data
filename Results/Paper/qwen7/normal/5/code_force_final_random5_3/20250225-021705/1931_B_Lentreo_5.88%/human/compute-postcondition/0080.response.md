Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where for each test case, it accepts an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5) and a list of n non-negative integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n. The function returns a result based on the given conditions for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a value for t and n, along with a list of integers. It checks if the sum of these integers is divisible by n and returns a result based on this condition for each test case.
