Output State: **`curr` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `last` is the last element of the list `nums`.**

The code initializes the variable `curr` to 0. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `nums`, and `last`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
