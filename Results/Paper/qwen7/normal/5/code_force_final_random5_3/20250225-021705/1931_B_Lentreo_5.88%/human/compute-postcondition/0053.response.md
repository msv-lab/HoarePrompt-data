Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t)`. The only variables involved here are `t` and the loop counter (which is an underscore `_` but doesn't affect the state directly).

2. **Understand the postcondition**: The postcondition given is about the variable `curr`, which is the sum of all non-zero elements in `nums` minus the initial value of `last`. If `curr` equals 0, it remains 0; otherwise, it is updated accordingly.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: Since the loop does not modify `t` or any other variables directly related to the loop head, the state of `curr`, `nums`, and `last` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

4. **Formulate the new state**: The state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the same conditions as the previous iteration since no changes are made to the loop head variables.

Given the information, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration.

**State: **`curr` is the sum of all non-zero elements in `nums` minus the initial value of `last`. If `curr` equals 0, then `curr` remains 0. Otherwise, `curr` is the sum of all non-zero elements in `nums` minus the initial value of `last`.**
