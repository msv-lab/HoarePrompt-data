Output State: **`curr` is the sum of all non-zero elements in the updated `nums` list minus the last element of the updated `nums` list plus `i` minus the last element of the updated `nums` list if `i` is not zero, otherwise `curr` remains unchanged; `i` is the next element in the `nums` list, and `nums` is the updated list.**

Explanation: The code `curr += i - last` updates `curr` by adding the value of `i - last` to it. If `i` is not zero, `curr` includes the value of `i` minus the last element of the `nums` list. If `i` is zero, `curr` remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected.
