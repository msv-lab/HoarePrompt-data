Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `curr` is the sum of all non-zero elements in `nums` minus the initial value of `last`. After executing the code, `nums` is updated to a list of integers obtained from user input, and `curr` is recalculated based on the new `nums` list.**

Explanation: The code `nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` takes a space-separated string of integers as input, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `nums`. The value of `n` and the calculation of `curr` based on `last` and the initial `nums` list remain unchanged, but `nums` itself is updated to reflect the new input.
