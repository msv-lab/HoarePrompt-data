You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        last = nums[-1]
        curr = 0
        for i in nums:
            if i != 0:
                curr += i - last
        if curr == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( t \) indicating the number of cases, then for each case, it reads an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) non-negative integers. It calculates the sum of all non-zero elements in the list, subtracting the last element of the list, and checks if this value is zero. If it is zero, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers equal by pouring water from one container to another, where the source container index \(i\) must be less than the destination container index \(j\).

2. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the amounts of water in each container.
   - It calculates the difference between the last element (`last`) and each element in the list (`nums`).
   - It sums these differences into `curr`.
   - If `curr` is zero, it prints 'YES', indicating it's possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Test Case 1**: Single container, `n=1`, `a=[43]`. Since there's only one container, it trivially meets the condition. Output: `YES` (Correct).
   - **Test Case 2**: Two containers, `n=2`, `a=[1, 3]`. The sum of water is 4, which is divisible by 2. However, no pouring operation can make both containers have the same amount of water. Output: `NO` (Correct).
   - **Test Case 3**: Five containers, `n=5`, `a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3]`. The total water is 15, which is divisible by 5. By pouring operations, we can make all containers have 3 units of water. Output: `YES` (Correct).
   - **Test Case 4**: Three containers, `n=3`, `a=[1, 2, 3]`. The total water is 6, which is divisible by 3. We can make all containers have 2 units of water. Output: `YES` (Correct).
   - **Test Case 5**: Seven containers, `n=7`, `a=[4, 5, 5, 0, 6, 4, 4]`. The total water is 30, which is divisible by 7. We cannot make all containers have the same amount of water. Output: `NO` (Correct).
   - **Test Case 6**: Seven containers, `n=7`, `a=[6, 5, 5, 1, 3, 4, 4]`. The total water is 30, which is divisible by 7. We cannot make all containers have the same amount of water. Output: `NO` (Correct).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The logic in the given solution is flawed. The approach of calculating the difference between the last element and each element, and then summing these differences, does not correctly determine if it's possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.
   - The correct approach would involve checking if the average amount of water per container is an integer and ensuring the total water is evenly divisible among all containers.
