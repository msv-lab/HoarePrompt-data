Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in nums:`. The variables involved here are `i` and `nums`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i`: This variable will take on each value from the list `nums` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `nums`: This is a list of integers.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: For the loop to execute, the list `nums` must contain at least one element. If `nums` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states based on the above understanding**:
   - We need to ensure that `nums` is not an empty list.
   - Since `i` will take on each value from `nums`, we don't need to explicitly set its initial value because it will be assigned values from `nums` during the loop iterations.

5. **Consider additional relevant information**:
   - `curr` is initially 0.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `last` is the last element of the list `nums`.

Given the above points, the only state that needs adjustment for the loop to execute is `nums` should not be an empty list. 

**Final Answer**:
State: **`nums` must not be an empty list**
