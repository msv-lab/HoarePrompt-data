Output State: **`curr` is 0, `last` is the last element of the updated `nums` list, `curr` is the sum of all non-zero elements in the updated `nums` list minus the last element of the updated `nums` list.**

Explanation: The code `curr = 0` sets the variable `curr` to 0. This changes the value of `curr` but does not affect the value of `last` or the description of `curr` in terms of the `nums` list. Therefore, the output state includes the new value of `curr` and retains the original description of `curr` in relation to the `nums` list.
