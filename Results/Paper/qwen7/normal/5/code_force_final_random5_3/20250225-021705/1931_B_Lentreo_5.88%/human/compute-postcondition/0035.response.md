Output State: **`curr` is the original value of `curr` plus `i` minus `last`, `i` is the first element of `nums`, and the current value of `i` is not 0.**

Explanation: The variable `curr` is updated by adding the value of `i` (which is the first element of `nums`) minus `last` to its current value. The other variables (`nums`, `i`, and `last`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
