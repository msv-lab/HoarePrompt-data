Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')`.

From the information given, we know that `i` is `n`. Therefore, `a[i]` refers to the element `a[n]`.

However, the value of `a[n]` itself is not explicitly given. Since we are only asked to describe what will be printed and not the exact numerical value, we can say that `a[i]` will print the value of `a[n]` twice, separated by a space (due to the `end=' '` parameter).

Thus, the output will be:

Output: **a[n] a[n]**
