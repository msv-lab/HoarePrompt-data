Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in res:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `res`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `res` contains at least one element.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `res` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `res` must still contain at least one element.
   - The variable `i` will take the value of the first element in `res` during the next iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `res` still contains at least one element, and `i` will be set to the first element of `res`.

**State: **`res` must contain at least one element, `i` is the first element in `res`**
