Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` remains unchanged, the element at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` is equal to 2, `ul` is 2**.

Explanation: The code `ul += 2` increments the value of `ul` by 2. Since `ul` was not previously defined, it is initialized to 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
