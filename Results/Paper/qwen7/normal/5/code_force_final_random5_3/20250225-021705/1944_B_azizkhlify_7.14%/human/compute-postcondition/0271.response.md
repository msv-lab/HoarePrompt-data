Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range `n` to `2 * n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - The loop starts with `i` in the range `n` to `2 * n`.
   - Therefore, `i` must start at `n` and go up to `2 * n - 1`.

3. **Adjust the State**:
   - We need to ensure that `i` is initialized to `n` at the start of the loop.
   - The value of `n` itself does not change within the loop, so it remains as given in the initial state.

4. **Other Variables**:
   - The variables `res`, `re`, `ul`, and `ur` are mentioned as remaining unchanged. They are not part of the loop head, so no adjustments are needed for these variables.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute correctly is:

- `i` should be set to `n` at the start of the loop.
- `n` remains as given in the initial state.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is as given in the initial state**
