Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 5000, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the third input split.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `a` by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state. The new list `a` is created based on the input provided.
