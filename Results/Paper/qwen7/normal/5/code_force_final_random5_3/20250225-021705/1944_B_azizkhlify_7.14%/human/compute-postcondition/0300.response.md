Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 2.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `l[a[2] - 1]` is either 2 or has not been checked.

We need to determine the values of `a[i]` when `i` is 2. Since `i` is 2, `a[i]` is equivalent to `a[2]`.

Given that no explicit value for `a[2]` is provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `a[2]`. However, we know that `a[2]` must exist and be a valid element in the list `a`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

This will print the value of `a[2]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **a[2] a[2]**
