Output State: **`i` is `n + 2` and less than `2 * n`; `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` by 1. Since `i` is initially `n + 2` and less than `2 * n`, this relationship remains unchanged. The value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1, but its specific value is not provided, so we only state that it has been incremented.
