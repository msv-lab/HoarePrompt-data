Output State: **`l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `l[a[i] - 1]` by 1. It also updates `i` to `i + 1`. The condition `i + 1 < n` must be true for the next iteration, but since we are only asked to describe the state after the given code is executed, we update the values of `l[a[i] - 1]` and `i` accordingly. The initial conditions of `n` and the other variables remain unchanged.
