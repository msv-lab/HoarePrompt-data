Output State: **Postcondition: `res` is an empty list, `i` is `n + 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block immediately preceding the `break` statement in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply indicates that the program would exit the current loop or conditional block. However, based on the initial state, the values of `res`, `i`, and the condition `r[a[i] - 1]` remain unchanged.
