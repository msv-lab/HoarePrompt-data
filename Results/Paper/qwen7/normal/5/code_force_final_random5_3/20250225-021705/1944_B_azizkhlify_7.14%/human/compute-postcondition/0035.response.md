Given the initial state where `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer, but no information about the value of `a` is provided, we need to consider the following:

- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `a` is a list or sequence, but its contents are not specified.

The print statement is:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

Since `i` is 1, the statement will print the first element of the list `a` twice, separated by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Output: **a[1] a[1]**
