Based on the initial state provided, the array `a` has been modified such that it contains specific values at indices 0, 3, and 5 after the loop has executed all its iterations. The output state is a string formed by concatenating these values.

However, the initial state does not specify the exact values of `a[0]`, `a[3]`, and `a[5]`. Therefore, we need to describe the output in terms of these unspecified values.

Output: **a[0]a[3]a[5]**
