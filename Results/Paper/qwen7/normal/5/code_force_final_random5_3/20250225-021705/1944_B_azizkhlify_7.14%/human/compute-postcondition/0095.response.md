Output State: **`res` is an empty list, and `i` is the last element that was printed during the loop execution.**

Explanation: Since the loop continues to reduce the size of `res` by one element per iteration and we know it executes until `res` becomes empty, the final state of `res` will be an empty list. The value of `i` will be the last element that was printed during the loop execution.
