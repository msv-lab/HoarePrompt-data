Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, and `l[a[i] - 1]` is either 2 or has not been checked.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or match a case in a switch statement. In this context, it means that the loop or case being processed is terminated. Since the `break` statement does not modify any variable values, the values of `i`, `n`, and `l[a[i] - 1]` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged values of these variables.
