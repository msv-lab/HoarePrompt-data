Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs as long as `i < n`.
   - The loop breaks early if `ul == k * 2`.

3. **Postconditions Provided:**
   - `i` is less than or equal to `n-1`.
   - `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `ul` is the original value of `ul` plus 6 if the loop executed 3 times, 8 if the loop executed 4 times, and so on until `i` reaches `n-1`.
   - If at any point `ul == k * 2`, the loop breaks early and `i` may be less than `n-1`.

4. **Determine Initial Values:**
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 0`, the initial value of `i` should be set to 0.
   - The initial value of `n` should be set to a value that allows the loop to run at least once (since `i` starts from 0).

5. **Adjust `k` and `ul`:**
   - The initial values of `k` and `ul` are not specified, but they need to be such that the loop can proceed according to the postconditions.
   - For the loop to execute, `k` and `ul` should be set in a way that the loop can run at least once without breaking early.

### Conclusion:

To ensure the loop can execute, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `i` should be set to 0.
- `n` should be set to a value that allows the loop to run at least once.
- `k` and `ul` should be set to values that allow the loop to proceed according to the given postconditions.

Given these considerations, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` and `ul` are set such that the loop can proceed according to the postconditions.**
