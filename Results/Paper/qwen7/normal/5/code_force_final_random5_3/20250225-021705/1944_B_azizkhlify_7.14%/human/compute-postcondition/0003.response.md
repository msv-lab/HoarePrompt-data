Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the third input split, `l` is a list of n zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `l` with `n` elements, each set to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
