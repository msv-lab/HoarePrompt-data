Output State: **`res` is an empty list, `i` is `n + 2`, `ur` is 2**

Explanation: The code `ur += 2` increments the value of `ur` by 2. Since `ur` was not previously defined, it is assumed to start at 0. After the increment, `ur` becomes 2. The values of `res` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
