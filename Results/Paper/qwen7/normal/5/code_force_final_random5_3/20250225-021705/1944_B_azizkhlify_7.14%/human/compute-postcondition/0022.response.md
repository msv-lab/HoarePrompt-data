Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Behavior**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n`. However, the information given is about the behavior of the loop when `i` ranges from `n` to `2 * n - 1`.

3. **Determine Initial Conditions**: We need to ensure that the loop can run correctly from `i = n` to `i = 2 * n - 1`. This means `i` should start at `n` and continue until `2 * n - 1`.

4. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop starts at `i = 0` and goes up to `i < n`, we need to ensure that `i` can transition to `n` and then continue to `2 * n - 1`. Therefore, `i` should start at `0` and `n` should be such that the loop can run through all necessary iterations.

Given the conditions after the loop:
- `i` equals `2 * n` after all iterations.
- `i` is no longer less than `2 * n`.
- For each `i` from `n` to `2 * n - 1`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.

To ensure the loop can execute and reach the specified conditions, we need to set `i` to `0` and `n` to a value that allows the loop to run through all necessary iterations.

**State Adjustment**:
- `i` should start at `0`.
- `n` should be a positive integer that allows the loop to run from `0` to `2 * n - 1`.

Therefore, the state before the loop should be adjusted to:
- `i` is `0`.
- `n` must be a positive integer.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be a positive integer**
