Output State: **`re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0**

Explanation: The code initializes three variables `re`, `ul`, and `ur` to 0. Since these are the only changes made to the variables, the output state reflects that these three new variables are set to 0, while the other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, `l`, and `r`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
