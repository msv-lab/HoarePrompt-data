Postcondition: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, the value of `l[a[1] - 1]` remains unknown, `re` is equal to `k` + 2, and `res` contains the elements `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[3]`.**

This means that after the if-else block executes:
- The variable `i` remains 3.
- The variable `n` remains greater than 0.
- The value of `l[a[1] - 1]` remains unchanged and is unknown.
- The variable `re` is updated to `k` + 2.
- The list `res` still contains the elements `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[3]`.
