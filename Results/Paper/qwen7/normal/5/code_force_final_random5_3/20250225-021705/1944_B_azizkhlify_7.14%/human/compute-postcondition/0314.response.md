Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Initial State: 
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - The value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1

2. The code snippet is:
   ```python
   print(a[i], end=' ')
   ```

3. To determine what will be printed, we need to find out the value of `a[i]`:
   - Given `i` is 0, we substitute `i` with 0 in `a[i]`.
   - Therefore, `a[i]` becomes `a[0]`.

4. We know from the initial state that `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1. Substituting `i` with 0, we get `l[a[0] - 1]` is 1.
   - This implies that `a[0] - 1` is the index in list `l` where the value 1 is located.
   - Since `l[a[0] - 1]` is 1, it means `a[0] - 1` is the index of 1 in list `l`.

5. However, the value of `a[0]` itself is not directly given. But since `a[0] - 1` is the index of 1 in list `l`, we can infer that `a[0]` must be 2 (because if `a[0]` were any other value, `a[0] - 1` would not be the correct index for 1 in list `l`).

6. Therefore, `a[0]` is 2.

7. The print statement will output the value of `a[0]` followed by a space due to the `end=' '` parameter.

Output: **2**
