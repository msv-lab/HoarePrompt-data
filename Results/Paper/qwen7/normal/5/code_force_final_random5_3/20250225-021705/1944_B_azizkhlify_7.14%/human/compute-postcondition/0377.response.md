Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is `n + 2`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `ur` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or match a case in a switch statement. In this context, since there is no loop or conditional structure around the `break` statement, the values of the variables `i`, `n`, and `ur` remain as they were in the initial state. Specifically, `i` is `n + 2`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `ur` is not modified because the condition for increasing `ur` (i.e., `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2) was not evaluated due to the `break` statement.
