Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head involves the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is `for i in range(n)`. This means the loop will iterate from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Determine the State Changes:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `re` is equal to `k`.
   - `i` is updated to `i + 1`.
   - `ul` is set to `i`.
   - `k` is updated to `2 * k - i`.
   - `r`, `ul`, `ur`, and `res` remain unchanged from their post-loop conditions.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `ul` will be set to this new value of `i`.
   - `k` will be updated to `2 * k - (i + 1)`.

5. **Formulate the New State:**
   - `re` remains unchanged.
   - `i` becomes `i + 1`.
   - `ul` becomes `i + 1`.
   - `k` becomes `2 * k - (i + 1)`.
   - `r`, `ul`, `ur`, and `res` remain unchanged.

Given the information, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`re` is equal to `k`, `i` is `i + 1`, `ul` is `i + 1`, `k` is `2 * k - (i + 1)`, `r`, `ul`, `ur`, and `res` remain unchanged from their post-loop conditions.**
