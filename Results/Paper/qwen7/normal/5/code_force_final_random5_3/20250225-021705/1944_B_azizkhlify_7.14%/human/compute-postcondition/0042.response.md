Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `ul` is set to 2 if `ul` equals `k * 2`. Otherwise, the value of `ul` remains unchanged.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it `i = 2`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is a positive integer.
   - The value of `ul` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no operations are specified that would change `ul`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, and `ul` remains unchanged**.
