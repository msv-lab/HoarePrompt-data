Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 2 * `n`, `ul` holds the last incremented value before exiting the loop, `k` is `2 * k - ul`, and `r`, `re`, `ul`, `ur`, and `res` remain unchanged from their post-loop conditions. Since (k) is true, `k` is non-zero.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
        print(a[i], end=' ')
        re += 1
        res.append(a[i])
    if re == k:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is less than `n`, `ul` holds the last incremented value before exiting the loop, `k` is `2 * k - ul`, `r`, `re`, `ul`, `ur`, and `res` remain unchanged from their post-loop conditions, and if the element at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `l` is equal to 1, then `re` is equal to `k` and the element `a[i]` is appended to `res`; otherwise, `re` is equal to `k` and `res` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `re` is equal to `k`, `i` is `i + 1`, `ul` is `i`, `k` is `2 * k - i`, `r`, `ul`, `ur`, and `res` remain unchanged from their post-loop conditions, and if the element at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `l` is equal to 1, then `res` contains the element `a[i]`; otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `re` is equal to `k` + 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `ul` is `i + 1`, `k` is `2 * k - (i + 1)`, and `res` is a list with the element `a[i]` appended. If `re` equals `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
