Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged (though its value is not provided, it does not affect the current print statement).
   - Either the element at index `a[0] - 1` in list `l` is equal to 2, in which case `ul` is set to 2, or the element is not equal to 2.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
   ```

Given that `i` is 1, the code snippet `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')` will print the value of `a[1]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

To determine what `a[1]` is, we need to consider the condition about `ul` and `a[0] - 1`:
- If `a[0] - 1` is equal to 2, then `ul` is set to 2.
- Otherwise, `ul` is not 2.

However, the value of `a[1]` is not directly affected by the condition involving `ul`. Therefore, the value of `a[1]` remains unknown from the given information.

Thus, the output will be the value of `a[1]` printed twice, followed by a space.

Output: **a[1] a[1]**
