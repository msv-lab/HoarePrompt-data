The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `res`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `res`. For the loop to execute again, `res` must be a non-empty iterable.

At the end of the previous iteration, `res` must be a non-empty list or iterable. For the loop to execute one more time, `res` must still be a non-empty iterable.

State: **`res` must be a non-empty list or iterable**
