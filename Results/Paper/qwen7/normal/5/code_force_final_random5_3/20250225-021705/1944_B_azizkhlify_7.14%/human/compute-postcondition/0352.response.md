Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - The loop starts with `i` iterating from `n` to `2 * n - 1`.
   - Therefore, `i` must be initialized to `n` at the start of the loop.

3. **Determine the Value of `n`**:
   - Since `i` starts from `n` and goes up to `2 * n - 1`, `n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0) for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Consider the State of `res`**:
   - The variable `res` contains elements based on the conditions involving `a` and `k`.
   - However, the initial state of `res` does not affect the loop's execution directly since the loop iterates over the range defined by `n` and `2 * n`.

5. **Consider the State of `ul` and `ur`**:
   - The loop condition mentions that `ul` is not equal to `ur`.
   - This condition is not directly related to the loop head variables (`i` and `n`), but it ensures that the loop can proceed.

Based on the above analysis, the only variables that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0**
