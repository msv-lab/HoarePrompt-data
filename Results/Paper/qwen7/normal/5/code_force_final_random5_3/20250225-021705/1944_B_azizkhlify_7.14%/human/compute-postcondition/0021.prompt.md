Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `k` is an integer obtained from the second input split, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the third input split, `l` is a list of `n` zeros where each zero has been incremented by 1 according to the indices specified by the elements of `a` (i.e., `l[a[i] - 1] += 1` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`), `r` is a list of `n` zeros, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is `n`, `n` must be a non-negative integer.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the list `l` will contain `n` elements, each initialized to 0 and then incremented by 1 for every occurrence of its index (adjusted by -1) in the list `a`. The other variables (`r`, `re`, `ul`, `ur`, `res`, `i`) will retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop, with `i` being equal to `n`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    r[a[i] - 1] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `n`, `i` must be less than `2 * n`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `n + 1` and less than `2 * n`; `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `n + 2` and less than `2 * n`; `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
