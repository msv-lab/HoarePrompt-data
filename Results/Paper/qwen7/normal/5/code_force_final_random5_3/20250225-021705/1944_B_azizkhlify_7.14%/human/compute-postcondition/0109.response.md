Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` is an empty list.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `r[a[i-1]]` is 2.

We need to determine the values of `a[i]` that will be printed.

Given that `i` is `n + 1`, it means `i` is one more than the length of the list `a`. Since `a[i-1]` corresponds to the last valid index of `a` (which is `n-1`), and we know that `r[a[i-1]]` is 2, it implies that the value at index `n-1` of `a` is such that when used as an index into `r`, it results in 2.

However, the actual value of `a[i]` (which is `a[n]` since `i = n + 1`) is not provided directly. Typically, if `a[i-1]` is used to index `r` and gives a value of 2, it suggests that `a[i]` might be related to this context, but without the explicit definition of `a`, we can only infer that `a[i]` is likely to be a value that would result in `r[a[i]-1]` being 2.

Since the exact value of `a[i]` is not specified, we can denote it as `x` where `x` is such that `r[x-1]` is 2. Given the context, `x` is likely to be 3 because `r[a[i]-1]` is 2, implying `a[i]-1` is 2, so `a[i]` is 3.

Therefore, the print statement will print `3` twice, followed by a space.

Output: **3 3**
