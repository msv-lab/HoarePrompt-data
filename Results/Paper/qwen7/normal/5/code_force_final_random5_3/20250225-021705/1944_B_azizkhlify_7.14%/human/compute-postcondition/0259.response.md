Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `l` is a list of `n` zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `l` with `n` elements, each set to 0. The values of `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
