Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved here is `_`, which is a placeholder indicating that we are iterating over the range of an input value.

2. **Determine the Input Value:**
   - The input value is obtained using `int(input())`.
   - This input value determines how many times the loop will run.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since the loop will run based on the input value, we need to ensure that this input value is valid.
   - From the problem statement, we know that the input value (let's call it `t`) should be a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that the input value is within the specified range.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000**
