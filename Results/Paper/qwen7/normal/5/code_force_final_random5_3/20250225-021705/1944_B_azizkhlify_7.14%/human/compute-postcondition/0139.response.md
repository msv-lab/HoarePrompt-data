Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `a[i] - 1` index in list `l` is incremented by 1.

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently `n-1`, for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it `n`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `i` should be set to `n` and `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust the state accordingly**:
   - `i` will be `n`.
   - `a[i] - 1` index in list `l` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, but since `i` is now `n`, this increment will happen for `a[n-1] - 1`.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is `n`, `a[i] - 1` index in list `l` is incremented by 1**.
