Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from `n` to `2 * n`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `2 * n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently equal to `n`, the loop will increment `i` by 1 at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, `i` will become `n + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `2 * n`. So, `i` needs to be less than `2 * n`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be `n + 1`.
   - `r[a[i] - 1]` will be incremented by 1 again in the next iteration, but this information is not directly relevant to adjusting the loop head variables.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be such that `i` is less than `2 * n`**
