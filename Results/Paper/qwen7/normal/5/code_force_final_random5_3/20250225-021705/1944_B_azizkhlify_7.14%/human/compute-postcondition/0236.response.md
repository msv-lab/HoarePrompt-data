Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `n` to `2 * n - 1` (inclusive).

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `a` is an array that includes at least the elements `a[0]`, `a[3]`, and `a[5]`.
   - `n` must be less than or equal to 5.
   - `i` is now `n`.
   - If `ul` equals `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` starts at `n` and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `n + 1`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `2 * n`.
   - Therefore, `n` remains the same, and `i` becomes `n + 1`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be `n + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same (less than or equal to 5).
   - The condition `if ul == ur` still applies, but since it hasn't been specified whether this condition was met or not, we keep it as is.

6. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `a` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no operations are performed on `a`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `i` becomes `n + 1`.
   - The condition `if ul == ur` remains the same.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`a` is an array that includes at least the elements `a[0]`, `a[3]`, and `a[5]`, `n` must be less than or equal to 5, `i` is now `n + 1`, and if `ul` equals `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
