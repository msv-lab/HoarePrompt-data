Given the initial state:
- `a` is an array that includes at least the elements `a[0]`, `a[3]`, and `a[5]`.
- `n` must be less than or equal to 5.
- `i` is now `n + 1`.
- If `ul` equals `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

From the initial state, we know:
- `i = n + 1`.
- Since `n` must be less than or equal to 5, `i` must be between 1 and 6 (inclusive).

However, the code snippet does not provide any information about the values of `ul` and `ur`, nor does it show any loops or conditions that would affect `i`. Therefore, we can assume that `i` is a valid index within the bounds of the array `a`.

Given the constraints, let's consider the possible values for `i`:
- If `n = 0`, then `i = 1`.
- If `n = 1`, then `i = 2`.
- If `n = 2`, then `i = 3`.
- If `n = 3`, then `i = 4`.
- If `n = 4`, then `i = 5`.
- If `n = 5`, then `i = 6`.

Since `i` is an index into the array `a`, and the array `a` includes at least `a[0]`, `a[3]`, and `a[5]`, the valid indices for `i` are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The value of `a[i]` will depend on the specific value of `i`.

For the sake of this example, let's assume `i` is 3 (one of the guaranteed indices). Therefore, `a[i]` would be `a[3]`.

Output: **a[3] a[3]**
