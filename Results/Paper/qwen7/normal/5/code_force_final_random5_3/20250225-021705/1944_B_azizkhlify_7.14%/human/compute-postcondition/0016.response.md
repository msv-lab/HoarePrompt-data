Output State: **`i` is `n`, `i` must be less than `2 * n`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the value at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `r`. Since `i` is equal to `n` and `i` must be less than `2 * n`, the value of `i` remains unchanged. However, the value at `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1.
