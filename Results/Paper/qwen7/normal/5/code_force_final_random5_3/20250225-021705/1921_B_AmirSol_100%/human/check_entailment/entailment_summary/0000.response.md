Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining the minimum number of operations needed to transform the initial state of cats in boxes (`s1`) to the desired state (`s2`).
- The given program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the number of cats that need to be added and removed to achieve the desired state.
- The function correctly counts:
  - `cats_to_add`: the number of positions where `s1[i]` is '0' and `s2[i]` is '1'.
  - `cats_to_remove`: the number of positions where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0'.
- The function then returns the maximum of these two counts, which represents the minimum number of operations required because each operation (adding or removing a cat) can only change one box at a time.
- Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, this approach is correct. The function correctly identifies the necessary operations without considering unnecessary intermediate states, as each cat movement or removal is counted directly.

Correctness: **True**
