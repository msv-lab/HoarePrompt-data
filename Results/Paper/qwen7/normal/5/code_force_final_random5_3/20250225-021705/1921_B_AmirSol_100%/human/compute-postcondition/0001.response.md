Output State: **`cats_to_add` is the number of positions where `s1[i]` is '0' and `s2[i]` is '1', `cats_to_remove` is the number of positions where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0' for `i` in the range of `n`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the number of positions where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0' and assigns this count to `cats_to_remove`. The initial value of `cats_to_add` remains unchanged. Therefore, `cats_to_add` is still the number of positions where `s1[i]` is '0' and `s2[i]` is '1', and `cats_to_remove` is the number of positions where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0'.
