Output State: **`cats_to_add` is the number of positions where `s1[i]` is '0' and `s2[i]` is '1' for `i` in the range of `n`. `n` is a positive integer, and `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1'.**

This means that `cats_to_add` is calculated by counting the number of indices `i` (where `i` ranges from `0` to `n-1`) where the character at index `i` in `s1` is '0' and the character at the same index in `s2` is '1'. The values of `n`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged.
