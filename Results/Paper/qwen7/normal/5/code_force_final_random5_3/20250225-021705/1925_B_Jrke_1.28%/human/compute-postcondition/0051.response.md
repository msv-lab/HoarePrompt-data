Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` is an integer obtained from the first input.
- `n` is an integer obtained from the second input.
- `k` is calculated as `x // n`, which means `k` is the quotient when `x` is divided by `n`.
- `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`.
- `l` contains all such divisors (divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `k`).
- The `range()` function is used with a positive integer greater than 0, but this does not affect the `print(1)` statement directly.

The `print(1)` statement simply prints the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
