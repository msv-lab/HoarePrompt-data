Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `x // n`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `x // n` to the variable `k`. Here, `//` denotes integer division, which means the result is the quotient of `x` divided by `n`, rounded down to the nearest whole number. The values of `x` and `n` remain unchanged, and `k` now holds the result of the integer division.
