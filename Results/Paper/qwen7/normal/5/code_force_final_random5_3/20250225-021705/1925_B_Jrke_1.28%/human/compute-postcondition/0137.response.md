Output State: **`i` is 5, `l` is a list containing elements [3, 5, 0, 0], `ans` is 5**.

Explanation: The code `ans = max(l)` updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum value in the list `l`. Initially, `l` is `[3, 5, 0]`. The maximum value in this list is `5`. After executing the line of code, `l` is updated to include an additional element `0` as per the postcondition, making `l` equal to `[3, 5, 0, 0]`. The value of `i` and `ans` are updated accordingly.
