Output State: **`i` is 5, `l` is a list containing elements [3, 5, 0], `ans` is 3.**

Explanation: The code appends `x // i` to the list `l`. Given that `i` is 5, and assuming `x` is not specified, we consider the general case where `x` is not provided and use the context that `i` is used directly. Since no specific value for `x` is given, we assume `x` is such that `x // i` evaluates to 0 (for example, `x` could be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4). Therefore, the list `l` becomes `[3, 5, 0]`. The values of `i` and `ans` remain unchanged.
