Postcondition: **`x` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `start` is 2 if `x` is even or 1 if `x` is odd, and `start` must be less than or equal to `stop`; `l` is a list containing the elements `ans` and `i` where `i` is less than or equal to `k`. The current value of `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`**.
