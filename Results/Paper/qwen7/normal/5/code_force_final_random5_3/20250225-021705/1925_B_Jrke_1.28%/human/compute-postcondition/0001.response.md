Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `x, n = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to `x` and `n`. Since the initial values of `x` and `n` are determined by user input, they are represented as "an input integer". The output state reflects that these variables now hold the values provided by the user.
