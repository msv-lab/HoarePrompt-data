Postcondition: `i` is 1 or 2, `x` is an integer input from the user, `n` is an integer input from the user, and `x` is an integer such that the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`; `l` is a list containing three elements which are `ans`, `i`, and `x // i`, and `i` is less than or equal to `k`, and the current value of `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`. If `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `l` contains `ans`, `i`, and `x // i`.
