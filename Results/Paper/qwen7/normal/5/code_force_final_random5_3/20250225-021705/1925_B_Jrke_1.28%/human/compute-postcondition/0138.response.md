Postcondition: `i` is 5, `l` is a list where the second element is 3 and the third element remains the maximum of the second element (3), and `ans` is 3. If `x` is divisible by `i` (which is 5), then `l` is updated to [3, 5, 0, 0] and `ans` is set to 5. Otherwise, the values of `l` and `ans` remain unchanged.
