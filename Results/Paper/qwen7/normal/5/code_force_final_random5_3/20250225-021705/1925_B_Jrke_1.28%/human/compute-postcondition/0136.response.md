Postcondition: `i` is 5, `l` is a list containing elements [3, 5, 0], `ans` is 3. If `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `x // i` remains unchanged, and `l` is updated to include an additional element 0. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `l`, and `ans` remain as they were before the if-else block executes.
