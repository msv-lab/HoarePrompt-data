Output State: **`x` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `start` is 2 if `x` is even or 1 if `x` is odd, and `start` must be less than or equal to `stop`; `l` is a list containing the elements `ans`, `i`, and `x // i`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `l.append(x // i)` appends the value of `x // i` to the list `l`. Initially, `l` contains the elements `ans` and `i`. After executing the code, `l` now contains `ans`, `i`, and `x // i`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
