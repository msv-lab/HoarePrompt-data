You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = map(int, input().split())
        k = x // n
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
            if x % i == 0:
                l = [ans]
                if i <= k:
                    l.append(i)
                if x // i <= k:
                    l.append(x // i)
                ans = max(l)
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \( x \) and \( n \). It calculates the maximum divisor of \( x \) that is less than or equal to \( \frac{x}{n} \) (if \( \frac{x}{n} \geq 1 \)), and prints this value. If \( \frac{x}{n} < 1 \), it directly prints 1. The function implicitly accepts three variables \( t \), \( x \), and \( n \) across multiple test cases, where \( t \) is the number of test cases, and for each test case, \( 1 \leq x \leq 10^8 \) and \( 1 \leq n \leq x \).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which denotes the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n`.

2. **Initial Calculation:**
   - It calculates `k = x // n`, which is the minimum difficulty per sub-problem if all sub-problems had the same difficulty.
   - If `k` is 1, it directly prints 1 because the GCD of any set of numbers where each number is 1 is 1.

3. **Finding Maximum Balance:**
   - If `k` is not 1, it initializes `ans` to 1.
   - It then iterates over odd numbers from 1 to the square root of `x` (inclusive).
     - For each odd number `i` that divides `x`, it checks if both `i` and `x // i` are less than or equal to `k`.
     - It updates `ans` to the maximum value among the current `ans` and the two potential divisors `i` and `x // i`.

4. **Output:**
   - After determining the maximum balance, it prints the result.

### Reasoning:

1. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case when `k` is 1 by printing 1 immediately.

2. **Divisor Check:**
   - The loop iterates over odd numbers from 1 to the square root of `x`. This is efficient since we only need to check up to the square root of `x` to find all divisors.
   - The program correctly identifies valid divisors `i` and `x // i` and ensures they do not exceed `k`.

3. **GCD Maximization:**
   - The logic to update `ans` with the maximum divisor found is correct. Since the GCD of a set of numbers is the largest number that divides all of them, finding the largest valid divisor ensures the maximum balance.

4. **Output:**
   - The output is printed correctly for each test case.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the maximum balance of the problemset. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
