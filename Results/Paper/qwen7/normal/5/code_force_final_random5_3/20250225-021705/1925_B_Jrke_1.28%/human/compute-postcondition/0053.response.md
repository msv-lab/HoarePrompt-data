Postcondition: `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `k` is `x // n`, `ans` will be the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`, `l` contains all such divisors, and if `k == 1`, then `ans` is 1 and `l` is a list containing 1. If `k != 1`, the values of `ans` and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states.
