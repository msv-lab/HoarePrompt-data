Output State: **`ans` is False, `i` is `m - 2`, `nums` is a list of integers formed from `arr[i - 1]` followed by the current element of `arr` as a single integer, and `arr[i - 1]` is now the first element of `nums`.**

Explanation: The code simply reassigns `ans` to `False`, which does not affect the values of `i`, `nums`, or `arr[i - 1]`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
