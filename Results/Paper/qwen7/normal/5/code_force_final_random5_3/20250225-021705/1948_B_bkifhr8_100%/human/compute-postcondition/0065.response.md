Output State: **`arr[i - 1]` is now `nums[0]`, `ans` remains False, `i` is `m - 2`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the first element of the list `nums` to the element `arr[i - 1]`. Since `i` was previously `m - 2`, `i - 1` becomes `m - 3`. The values of `ans` and `i` are updated, while the condition about breaking out of the loop if `nums` is not sorted remains unchanged because the sorting check was not performed in this snippet.
