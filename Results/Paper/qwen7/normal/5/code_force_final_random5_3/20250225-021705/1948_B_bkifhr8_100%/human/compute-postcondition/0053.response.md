Output State: **`ans` is False, `i` is `m - 1`, `nums` is a list containing the integer representation of the last element of `arr` followed by the current element of `arr` transformed into a list of integers.**

Explanation: The line `ans = False` simply assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `ans`. No other changes are made to the other variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `arr`, `i`, and `nums` remain unchanged from their initial states.
