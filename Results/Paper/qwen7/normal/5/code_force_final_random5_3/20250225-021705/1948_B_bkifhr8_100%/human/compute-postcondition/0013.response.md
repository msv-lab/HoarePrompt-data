Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer that must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `ans` is False, `i` is `m - 1`, and `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`. If the list `nums` is not sorted, `ans` remains False and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
