Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is explicitly given as 1.
   - `m` is the integer input by the user.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `m-1` to `0` (exclusive) with a step of `-1`. This means the loop will run as long as `m-1` is greater than or equal to 0.

4. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `m-1` must be greater than or equal to 0. This implies that `m` must be at least 1.
   - Since `i` is already set to 1, it does not need to be adjusted.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - We need to ensure that `m` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.
   - The other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, and `ans`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `m` must be at least 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `ans` is True, `i` is 1**
