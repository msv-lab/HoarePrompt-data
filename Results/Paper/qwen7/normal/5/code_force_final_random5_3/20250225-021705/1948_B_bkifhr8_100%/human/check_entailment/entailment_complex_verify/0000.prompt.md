You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n such that 2 <= n <= 50, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 0 <= a_i <= 99.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        ans = True
        
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 2, `m` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user, `ans` remains False, `i` is -1.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will eventually reach -1 because the loop starts from `m-1` and decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. If the loop completes all iterations without finding any pair of elements in `arr` that violate the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then `ans` will still be False. The value of `m` will be 0 since the loop processes each element in `arr` exactly once. The variable `i` will be -1 after the loop completes, indicating that the loop has finished processing all elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99). For each test case, it checks if the sequence of integers can be rearranged such that for every pair of consecutive elements, the first element is not less than the second element. If such a rearrangement is possible, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be sorted using the specified operation. Specifically, the program checks if the current element is less than the previous element and attempts to split the previous element to see if sorting is possible. However, the logic for splitting and checking is flawed.

Consider the following test case:
```
4
12 3 45 67
```

- The initial array is `[12, 3, 45, 67]`.
- When comparing `67` and `45`, the program checks if `[45, 67]` can be sorted, which is true, but it doesn't update the array correctly.
- The correct approach would be to check if the array can be made sorted by repeatedly applying the operation until no more elements can be split or the array is sorted.

The provided solution does not handle the correct logic for determining if the array can be sorted after applying the operation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
