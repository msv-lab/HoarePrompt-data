Output State: **`ans` is False, `i` is `m - 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `ans`, `i`, or `nums`. It simply indicates that the execution would exit the current loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged, and the only effect is that the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
