Output State: **`ans` is False, `i` is `m - 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block provided, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `ans`, `i`, and the definition of `nums` remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the implied loop or conditional block.
