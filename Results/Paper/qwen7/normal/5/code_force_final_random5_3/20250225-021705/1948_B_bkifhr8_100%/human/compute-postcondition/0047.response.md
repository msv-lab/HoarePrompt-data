Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `ans` is False, `i` is 1, `nums` is a list containing the integer representation of the last element of `arr` followed by the current element of `arr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition `nums != sorted(nums)` is true or false, the final state of the variables remains as specified, with `ans` being set to False due to the condition not being met, and the loops or if statements being exited.
