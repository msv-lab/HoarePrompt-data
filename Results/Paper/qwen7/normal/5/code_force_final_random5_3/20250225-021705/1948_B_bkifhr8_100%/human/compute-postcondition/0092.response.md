Output State: **`ans` remains False, `i` is `m - 2`, `nums` is a list containing the last digit of `arr[i-1]` and the element `arr[i]`, and `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`**.

Explanation: The code updates `arr[i - 1]` to be equal to the first element of the list `nums`. Since `nums` contains the last digit of `arr[i-1]` and the element `arr[i]`, the first element of `nums` is the last digit of `arr[i-1]`. The values of `ans`, `i`, and the list `nums` remain unchanged except for the updated value of `arr[i - 1]`.
