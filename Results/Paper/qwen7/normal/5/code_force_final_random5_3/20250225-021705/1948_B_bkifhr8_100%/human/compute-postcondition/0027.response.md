Output State: **`ans` is False, `i` is `m - 3`, `nums` is a list containing the integer value of the last element of `arr` concatenated with the integer value of the element before it.**

Explanation: The line `ans = False` simply assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `ans`. No other changes are made to the other variables, so their states remain as initially described.
