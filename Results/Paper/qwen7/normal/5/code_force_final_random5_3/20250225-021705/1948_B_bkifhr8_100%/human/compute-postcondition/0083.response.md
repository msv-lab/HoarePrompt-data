Output State: **`ans` is False, `i` is `m - 2`, `arr[0]` is `nums[0]`**.

Explanation: The code `arr[i - 1] = nums[0]` updates the element at index `i - 1` in the list `arr` to be equal to the first element of the list `nums`. Given that `i` was initially `m - 1`, after the decrement (`i - 1`), `i` becomes `m - 2`. The value of `nums[0]` is assigned to `arr[0]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
