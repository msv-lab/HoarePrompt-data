Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the integer input by the user, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `ans` is True, `i` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
        nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
        if nums != sorted(nums):
            ans = False
            break
        arr[i - 1] = nums[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `arr` is a list of integers where the element at index `i-1` is now equal to the first element of `nums`, `ans` is False, `i` is 1, `nums` is a list containing the integer representation of the last element of `arr` followed by the current element of `arr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` remains False, `i` is `m - 1`, `nums` is a list containing the integer representation of the last element of `arr` followed by the current element of `arr` transformed into a list of integers, and `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to the first element of `nums`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `ans` remains False, `i` is `m - 2`, `arr[i - 1]` is now `nums[0]`, and if `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then `arr[i]` is updated to `arr[i - 1]`; otherwise, `arr[i]` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
