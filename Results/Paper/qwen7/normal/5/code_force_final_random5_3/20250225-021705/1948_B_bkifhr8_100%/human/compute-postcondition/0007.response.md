Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer that must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `ans` is True, `i` is m - 1, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `nums` by converting each character in the string representation of `arr[i - 1]` into integers and appending the integer value of `arr[i]` to this list. Since `arr[i]` is already an integer, it is directly appended to the list without conversion. The other variables remain unchanged.
