### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   
2. **Function Call**:
   - The program calls `func_1(arr)` to calculate the minimum cost required to make all elements of the array equal.
   - The result of `func_1(arr)` is printed for each test case.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation.
   - It uses two pointers `i` and `j` to identify the segments of the array where elements are different from the first and last elements, respectively.
   - The logic inside the function:
     - It first finds the rightmost segment starting from the beginning where all elements are the same (`arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`).
     - Then, it finds the leftmost segment ending from the end where all elements are the same (`arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`).
     - If the first and last elements are the same, it returns the length of the segment from `i` to `j - 1`.
     - Otherwise, it returns the minimum cost between:
       - Changing the entire array except the prefix of length `i` to the last element.
       - Changing the entire array except the suffix of length `n - j` to the first element.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases where the entire array might already be equal.
   - It also handles cases where the first and last elements are the same but the middle part needs to be changed.

5. **Output**:
   - The function outputs the correct minimum cost for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
