### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotated code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to minimize the cost of making all elements of the array equal by performing at most one operation. The cost of the operation is defined as the length of the subarray selected.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   i = 0
   n = len(arr)
   j = len(arr) - 1
   ```
   - `i` starts at the beginning of the array.
   - `j` starts at the end of the array.

2. **First Loop:**
   ```python
   while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
       i += 1
   ```
   - This loop increments `i` until it encounters a different element or reaches the second-to-last element of the array. Thus, `i` will point to the position right after the last group of consecutive duplicates, or to the end of the array if there are no duplicates.

3. **Second Loop:**
   ```python
   while j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]:
       j -= 1
   ```
   - This loop decrements `j` until it encounters a different element or reaches the first element of the array. Thus, `j` will be 0 if all elements are identical, otherwise, it will point to the last element of the array.

4. **Condition Check:**
   ```python
   if arr[0] == arr[-1]:
       return max(j - i - 1, 0)
   ```
   - If the first and last elements are the same, the function returns the maximum value between 0 and the difference between `j` and `i`, minus 1. Since `j` is 0 and `i` is the length of the array, this will always return 0.

5. **Default Return:**
   ```python
   return max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)
   ```
   - If the first and last elements are not the same, the function returns the maximum value between the minimum of (`n - i - 1` and `j`) and 0. Since `j` is 0, this will always return 0.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Subarrays:**
   - The function does not correctly identify the smallest subarray that can be changed to make all elements equal. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 1]`, the optimal solution would be to change the entire array to `3` with a cost of 3, but the function incorrectly calculates the cost as 4.

2. **Logic Flaws:**
   - The function does not consider the possibility of changing a smaller subarray to achieve the minimum cost. It only checks the first and last elements and does not explore other potential subarrays.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
