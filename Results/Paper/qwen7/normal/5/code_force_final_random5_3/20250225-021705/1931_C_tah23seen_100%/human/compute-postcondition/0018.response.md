Output State: `i` is equal to the length of `arr`, `j` is 0, and all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[i-1]` are identical.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `j` will eventually reach 0 because the loop decrements `j` by 1 each time it finds that `arr[j]` is equal to `arr[j - 1]`. Since the loop stops when `j` is no longer greater than 0, `j` will be 0 at the end. Also, since the loop only increments `i` when it skips over consecutive duplicates, `i` will always be equal to the length of `arr` because the condition to increment `i` is never met (as the loop only affects `j`). All elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[i-1]` (which is the entire array) are identical due to the initial condition and the nature of the loop.
