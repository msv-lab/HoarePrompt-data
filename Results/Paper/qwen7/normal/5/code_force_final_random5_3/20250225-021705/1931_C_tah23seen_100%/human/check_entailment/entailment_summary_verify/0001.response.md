### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - This part of the program is correct and well-implemented.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The program calls `func_1(arr)` to calculate the minimum cost required to make all elements of the array equal.
   - The result of `func_1(arr)` is printed for each test case.
   - This part of the program is also correct.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation.
   - However, the logic inside the function has some issues:
     - The function identifies the positions `i` and `j` as described in the summary, but it does not correctly account for the cost of the operation.
     - The function should consider the cost of changing the subarray from `i` to `j` to a single value, which is `(j - i + 1)` burles.
     - The current implementation does not correctly calculate the cost of the operation and instead returns a fixed value based on the positions `i` and `j`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases where the entire array might already be equal.
   - However, it does not handle the general case where the array needs to be changed to a single value using the minimum cost operation.
   - For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`. The function would incorrectly return 2 (the length of the segment from `i` to `j - 1`), but the correct answer should be 4 (cost of changing the entire array except the prefix or suffix).

5. **Output**:
   - The function outputs the incorrect minimum cost for some test cases.
   - For instance, the test case `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]` should output 4, but the function outputs 2.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation. The function `func_1` does not accurately calculate the cost of the operation and returns incorrect results for many test cases.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
