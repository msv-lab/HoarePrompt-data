Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of `arr`, `j` is the length of `arr` - 3, and all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[i-1]` are identical, and `arr[j]` must be equal to `arr[j - 1]`**

Explanation: The code `j -= 1` decrements the value of `j` by 1. Initially, `j` was equal to the length of `arr` - 2. After decrementing, `j` becomes the length of `arr` - 3. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
