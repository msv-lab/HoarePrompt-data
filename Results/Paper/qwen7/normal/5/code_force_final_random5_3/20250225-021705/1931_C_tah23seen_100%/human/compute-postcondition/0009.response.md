Output State: `i` is equal to the length of `arr`; `j` is the length of `arr` - 1, and all consecutive elements in `arr` are equal.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` as long as `i` is less than the length of `arr` minus one and the element at index `i` is equal to the element at index `i + 1`. Given that the loop executes up to three times and each time it finds consecutive elements that are equal, it suggests that all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[4]` (inclusive) are the same. Therefore, once `i` reaches the length of `arr`, the condition `i < len(arr) - 1` will no longer be satisfied, and the loop will terminate. At this point, `i` will be equal to the length of `arr`, and `j` will still be the length of `arr` - 1 since it was not modified within the loop.
