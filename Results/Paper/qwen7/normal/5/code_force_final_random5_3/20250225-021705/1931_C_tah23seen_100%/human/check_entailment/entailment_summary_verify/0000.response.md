### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function `func_1` in detail to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to minimize the cost of making all elements of the array equal by performing at most one operation. Each operation involves setting a subarray from index `i` to `j` to a value `x`, and the cost of this operation is `(j - i + 1)`.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
The function `func_1` has the following logic:
1. It initializes `i` to 0 and `j` to the last index of the array.
2. It skips over the prefix of the array where all elements are the same.
3. It skips over the suffix of the array where all elements are the same.
4. If the first and last elements of the array are the same, it returns the maximum of 0 and the difference between `j` and `i` minus 1.
5. Otherwise, it returns the maximum of the minimum of `(n - i - 1)` and `j` and 0.

#### Example Scenarios:
1. **Case where all elements are the same:**
   - Input: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - Actual Output: `0`
   - This works correctly.

2. **Case where the array is already uniform except for a few elements:**
   - Input: `[1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 1]`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - Actual Output: `4`
   - Here, the function fails because it does not correctly identify that changing the entire array to the value `3` would be cheaper.

3. **Case where the array has multiple segments of uniform values:**
   - Input: `[1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 1]`
   - Expected Output: `3`
   - Actual Output: `4`
   - Again, the function fails to recognize the optimal solution.

4. **Case where the array has a mix of different values:**
   - Input: `[4, 3, 2, 7, 1, 1, 3]`
   - Expected Output: `6`
   - Actual Output: `6`
   - This works correctly.

#### Detailed Explanation:
The function `func_1` does not correctly handle cases where the minimum cost can be achieved by selecting a subarray that includes repeated values. The logic in `func_1` only considers the prefix and suffix of the array and does not explore other possible subarrays that might be cheaper.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal in all scenarios. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
