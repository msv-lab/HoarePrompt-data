Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is given as:
   ```
   while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
   ```

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `j` is the length of `arr` - 1
   - `arr[0] == arr[1]`

3. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, both conditions in the `while` statement must be true:
     - `i < len(arr) - 1`
     - `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`

4. **Check the Current Values:**
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the first condition `i < len(arr) - 1` will depend on the length of `arr`.
   - The second condition `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` requires checking `arr[1] == arr[2]`.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - To ensure the loop continues, `i` must be incremented such that `i < len(arr) - 1` holds true.
   - Additionally, `arr[1]` must be equal to `arr[2]` for the second condition to hold.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The variable `i` must be incremented to satisfy `i < len(arr) - 1`.
   - The value of `arr[1]` must be equal to `arr[2]` to satisfy the second condition.

### Final State:
- `i` must be incremented to a value that satisfies `i < len(arr) - 1`.
- `arr[1]` must be equal to `arr[2]`.

Since `i` is currently 1, the smallest value for `i` that satisfies `i < len(arr) - 1` would be 2 (assuming `len(arr)` is at least 3).

Therefore, the final state should be:
State: **`i` is 2, `j` is the length of `arr` - 1, and `arr[1]` is equal to `arr[2]`**
