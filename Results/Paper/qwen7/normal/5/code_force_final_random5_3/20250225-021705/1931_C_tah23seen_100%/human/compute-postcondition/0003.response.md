Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`.
2. **Analyze the variables involved in the loop condition**:
   - `i`: The current index.
   - `len(arr) - 1`: The last index of the array.
   - `arr[i]`: The element at the current index.
   - `arr[i + 1]`: The element at the next index.

3. **Determine the initial values**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is the length of `arr` - 1.

4. **Check the loop condition with the given initial values**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be less than `len(arr) - 1` and `arr[i]` must be equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

5. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since `i` is initially 0, we need to check if `0 < len(arr) - 1` and if `arr[0] == arr[1]`.
   - The condition `0 < len(arr) - 1` is always true as long as `len(arr)` is greater than 1.
   - Therefore, the key condition to satisfy is `arr[0] == arr[1]`.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `arr[0] == arr[1]`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 0; `j` is the length of `arr` - 1 and `arr[0] == arr[1]`**
