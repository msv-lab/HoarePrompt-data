Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\).
   - The pair \((a, b)\) must satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Provided Functions:**
   - `func_1(a, b)`: This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - `func_2(n, m)`: This function attempts to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) but seems to be implementing an incorrect logic.

3. **Analysis of `func_2` Implementation:**
   - The function iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m-1\).
   - It calculates \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\).
   - It then increments the count `cnt` by `x // y` and adds 1 if \(i > 1\).

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic in `func_2` does not correctly implement the required condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The expressions \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\) do not relate to the problem statement at all.
   - The increment operations do not account for the GCD or the multiple condition.

### Conclusion

Given that `func_2` does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem, the provided program is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
