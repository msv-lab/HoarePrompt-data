Output State: **The program returns cnt which is 2*n - 8**

Given the initial state:
- `cnt` is calculated as `2*n - 8`
- `i` is `2*10^6`
- `m` is `2*10^6`
- `n` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^6`
- `x` is `n - (2*10^6 * 2*10^6 - 2*10^6)`
- `y` is `(2*10^6)^2`
- `cnt` is not equal to 0

The code `return cnt` simply returns the value of `cnt`. Since `cnt` is defined as `2*n - 8`, the program returns this value.
