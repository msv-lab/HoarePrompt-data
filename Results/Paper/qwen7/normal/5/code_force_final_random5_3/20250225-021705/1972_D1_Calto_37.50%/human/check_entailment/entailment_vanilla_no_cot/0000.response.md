Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. The `func_2` function does not accurately count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. Specifically, the approach used in `func_2` seems to be unrelated to the problem's requirements and does not account for the condition that \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

To solve this problem correctly, you would need to iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within their respective ranges and check if they satisfy the given condition. Here is a more appropriate way to solve it:

```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt

# Example usage
t = int(input().strip())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().strip().split())
    print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
```

This code iterates over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks if they satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This approach ensures that the solution is correct according to the problem statement.
