You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6.
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, m):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        
        y = i * i
        
        cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `cnt` is 2*n - 8, `i` is 2*10^6, `m` is 2*10^6, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^6, `x` is `n - (2*10^6 * 2*10^6 - 2*10^6)`, `y` is (2*10^6)^2.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = m-1`. Given the output state after 3 iterations, we can infer the general formula for `cnt` as `2*n - 8`. Since `m` is a positive integer up to 2⋅10^6 and the loop continues until `i` reaches `m-1`, the final value of `i` will be 2*10^6 and `m` will also be 2*10^6. The values of `x` and `y` are calculated based on the final value of `i`, which is 2*10^6. Thus, `x` becomes `n - ((2*10^6)^2 - 2*10^6)` and `y` becomes `(2*10^6)^2`.
    if (cnt == 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: `cnt` is 2*n - 8, `i` is 2*10^6, `m` is 2*10^6, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^6, `x` is `n - (2*10^6 * 2*10^6 - 2*10^6)`, `y` is (2*10^6)^2, and `cnt` is not equal to 0
    return cnt
    #The program returns cnt which is 2*n - 8
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters n and m, and returns 1 in Case_1. In Case_2, it returns cnt which is calculated as 2*n - 8.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 1

Case_2: The program returns cnt which is 2*n - 8


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
