Reasoning:
The provided solution uses two functions, but the logic implemented in `func_2` does not match the problem statement. Specifically, the problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, `func_2` does not implement this logic. Instead, it uses a different formula that seems unrelated to the problem constraints.

Let's break down the problem:
- We need to iterate over all possible values of \(a\) from 1 to \(n\) and \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
- For each pair \((a, b)\), we need to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Given the provided code, `func_2` does not correctly implement this logic. It instead calculates something else entirely, which is why it does not solve the problem as stated.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
