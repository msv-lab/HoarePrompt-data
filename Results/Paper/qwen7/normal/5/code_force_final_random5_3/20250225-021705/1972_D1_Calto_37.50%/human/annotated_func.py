    #
    #Explanation: The given loop implements the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. After the loop completes all its iterations, `a` will hold the GCD of the initial values of `a` and `b`, and `b` will be `0`.

    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`, with `b` being 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`. It computes their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. Upon completion, it returns the GCD of `a` and `b`, with `b` being set to 0.

        cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `cnt` is 2*n - 8, `i` is 2*10^6, `m` is 2*10^6, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^6, `x` is `n - (2*10^6 * 2*10^6 - 2*10^6)`, `y` is (2*10^6)^2.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = m-1`. Given the output state after 3 iterations, we can infer the general formula for `cnt` as `2*n - 8`. Since `m` is a positive integer up to 2⋅10^6 and the loop continues until `i` reaches `m-1`, the final value of `i` will be 2*10^6 and `m` will also be 2*10^6. The values of `x` and `y` are calculated based on the final value of `i`, which is 2*10^6. Thus, `x` becomes `n - ((2*10^6)^2 - 2*10^6)` and `y` becomes `(2*10^6)^2`.
    if (cnt == 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: `cnt` is 2*n - 8, `i` is 2*10^6, `m` is 2*10^6, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^6, `x` is `n - (2*10^6 * 2*10^6 - 2*10^6)`, `y` is (2*10^6)^2, and `cnt` is not equal to 0
    return cnt
    #The program returns cnt which is 2*n - 8
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, where `n` is a positive integer and `m` is a positive integer up to 2⋅10^6. It calculates the value of `cnt` using a loop and returns either 1 or `2*n - 8` based on the value of `cnt`. If `cnt` equals 0, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns `2*n - 8`.
