You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, m):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
    if cnt == 0:
        return 1
    return cnt



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, where `n` is a positive integer and `m` is a positive integer up to 2⋅10^6. It calculates the value of `cnt` using a loop and returns either 1 or `2*n - 8` based on the value of `cnt`. If `cnt` equals 0, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns `2*n - 8`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not address the main problem statement, which requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The function `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, which is correct but not used in the context of solving the main problem. The function `func_2` seems to be an attempt to solve the problem using a different approach, but it does not correctly handle all cases.

To illustrate, let's consider a few test cases:

1. For \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\):
   - Expected output: 14
   - Actual output from the provided code: 14 (This seems correct for this specific case)

2. For \(n = 3\) and \(m = 5\):
   - Expected output: 4
   - Actual output from the provided code: 4 (This seems correct for this specific case)

However, let's consider another case to check the general correctness:

3. For \(n = 100\) and \(m = 1233\):
   - Expected output: 153
   - Actual output from the provided code: 153 (This seems correct for this specific case)

While the provided code seems to work for the given examples, it does not cover all potential cases. A more comprehensive solution would involve iterating through all possible pairs (a, b) and checking the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\). The current implementation does not seem to handle this logic correctly.

Therefore, the program is not fully correct and fails to meet the problem description for every potential case.
