Output State: **`cnt` is 2*n, `i` is 10, `m` must be greater than 10, `x` is -79, `y` is 100**

Explanation: The code `y = i * i` assigns the value of `i * i` to `y`. Given that `i` is 10, `y` is calculated as `10 * 10`, which equals 100. The values of `cnt`, `m`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
