You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, m):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
    if cnt == 0:
        return 1
    return cnt



- Annotated Code: 
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_2(n, m)
    print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State: Output State: The greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b` will be the final value of `a` when the loop finishes, and `b` will be `0`.
    #
    #Explanation: The given loop implements the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. After the loop completes all its iterations, `a` will hold the GCD of the initial values of `a` and `b`, and `b` will be `0`.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`, with `b` being 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`. It computes their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. Upon completion, it returns the GCD of `a` and `b`, with `b` being set to 0.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6.
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, m):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        
        y = i * i
        
        cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `cnt` is 2*n - 8, `i` is 2*10^6, `m` is 2*10^6, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^6, `x` is `n - (2*10^6 * 2*10^6 - 2*10^6)`, `y` is (2*10^6)^2.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = m-1`. Given the output state after 3 iterations, we can infer the general formula for `cnt` as `2*n - 8`. Since `m` is a positive integer up to 2⋅10^6 and the loop continues until `i` reaches `m-1`, the final value of `i` will be 2*10^6 and `m` will also be 2*10^6. The values of `x` and `y` are calculated based on the final value of `i`, which is 2*10^6. Thus, `x` becomes `n - ((2*10^6)^2 - 2*10^6)` and `y` becomes `(2*10^6)^2`.
    if (cnt == 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: `cnt` is 2*n - 8, `i` is 2*10^6, `m` is 2*10^6, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^6, `x` is `n - (2*10^6 * 2*10^6 - 2*10^6)`, `y` is (2*10^6)^2, and `cnt` is not equal to 0
    return cnt
    #The program returns cnt which is 2*n - 8
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, where `n` is a positive integer and `m` is a positive integer up to 2⋅10^6. It calculates the value of `cnt` using a loop and returns either 1 or `2*n - 8` based on the value of `cnt`. If `cnt` equals 0, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns `2*n - 8`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\).
   - The pair \((a, b)\) must satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Provided Functions:**
   - `func_1(a, b)`: This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - `func_2(n, m)`: This function attempts to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) but seems to be implementing an incorrect logic.

3. **Analysis of `func_2` Implementation:**
   - The function iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m-1\).
   - It calculates \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\).
   - It then increments the count `cnt` by `x // y` and adds 1 if \(i > 1\).

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic in `func_2` does not correctly implement the required condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The expressions \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\) do not relate to the problem statement at all.
   - The increment operations do not account for the GCD or the multiple condition.

### Conclusion

Given that `func_2` does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem, the provided program is incorrect.
