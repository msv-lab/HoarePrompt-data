### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b`.
   - The GCD is used in the main logic of the second function `func_2`, so it is correctly implemented.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` is supposed to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.
   - However, the current implementation of `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
   - Specifically, the loop and the calculations inside the loop do not match the problem statement. The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `m-1` and uses `i * i` and `n - (i * i - i)` in a way that does not align with the conditions \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Problem Description**:
   - The problem requires counting pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The correct approach would involve iterating over possible values of `a` and `b`, calculating the GCD, and checking the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).

4. **Current Implementation**:
   - The current implementation of `func_2` does not correctly check the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).
   - Instead, it uses a loop that does not reflect the necessary logic to solve the problem as described.

Given the above analysis, the provided implementation of `func_2` does not correctly solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
