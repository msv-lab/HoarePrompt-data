Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(", ")", `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is an empty string, `d` is a dictionary with one key-value pair {1: 0}, `i` is 3**

Explanation: Initially, the dictionary `d` has the key-value pair `{1: 1}` if `s[1]` is "(", otherwise `{1: -1}`. After executing `d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1`, since `i` is 2, `d[i + 1]` refers to `d[3]`. The value of `d[3]` is set to `d[2] - 1`. However, `d[2]` does not exist yet, so it defaults to 0 (as per the rule of dictionaries where non-existent keys default to 0). Therefore, `d[3]` is set to `0 - 1`, which is `-1`. The values of `s`, `n`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.
