Output State: The dictionary `d` is empty; `i` is `n-1`; `ans` is the original string `s`.

Explanation: Since the loop continues as long as there are items in the dictionary `d`, and we know from the output state after 3 iterations that `d` must have at least one item initially, after all iterations, the dictionary `d` will be empty because the loop has processed all its items. The variable `i` starts at `n-1` and gets decremented with each iteration but does not go below 0 (since it's an index), so after all iterations, `i` remains `n-1`. The variable `ans` accumulates the string `s` character by character during each iteration, so by the end of all iterations, `ans` will be the entire string `s`.
