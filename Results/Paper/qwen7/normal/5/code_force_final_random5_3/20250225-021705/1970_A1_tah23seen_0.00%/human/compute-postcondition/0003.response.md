Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", representing a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary with one key-value pair `{0: 0}`.**

Explanation: The code `d[0] = 0` assigns the value `0` to the key `0` in the dictionary `d`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
