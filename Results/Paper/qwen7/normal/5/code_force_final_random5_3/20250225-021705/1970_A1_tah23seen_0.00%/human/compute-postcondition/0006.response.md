Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(", ")", `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is an empty string, `d` is a dictionary with one key-value pair {1: 1}, `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1` updates the dictionary `d` by setting the key `i + 1` (which is 1) to the value `d[i] + 1` (which is 0 + 1 = 1). All other variables remain unchanged.
