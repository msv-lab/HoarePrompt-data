Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   ```python
   n = input()
   print(func_1(n))
   ```
   - The program reads a string `s` from the input.
   - It calls the function `func_1` with the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   ```python
   def func_1(s):
       n = len(s)
       ans = ''
       d = {}
       d[0] = 0
       for i in range(len(s)):
           if s[i] == '(':
               d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
           else:
               d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
       d.pop(n)
       d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
       for (i, j) in d:
           ans += s[i]
       return ans
   ```

   - **Initialization:**
     - `n` is the length of the string `s`.
     - `ans` is initialized as an empty string.
     - `d` is a dictionary where keys are positions (from 1 to `n`) and values are the prefix balances.

   - **Building the Prefix Balance Dictionary:**
     - A loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
     - If the character is '(', the balance increases by 1.
     - If the character is ')', the balance decreases by 1.
     - The dictionary `d` is updated with these balances.

   - **Removing the Last Key:**
     - `d.pop(n)` removes the last key-value pair from the dictionary, which corresponds to the full length of the string.

   - **Sorting the Dictionary:**
     - The dictionary items are sorted based on their values (prefix balances).
     - Ties are broken by the keys (positions), but since `d.pop(n)` removes the last entry, there should be no ties.

   - **Constructing the Result String:**
     - A loop iterates over the sorted dictionary items.
     - Characters corresponding to the sorted positions are appended to `ans`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Handling of Ties in Sorting:**
   - The problem statement specifies that in case of a tie in prefix balance, the positions should be sorted in decreasing order.
   - However, the current implementation sorts only by prefix balance without considering the position.

2. **Missing Position Sorting:**
   - To handle ties correctly, the sorting key should be a tuple `(balance, -position)` instead of just `balance`.

### Corrected Program

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans
```

### Conclusion

The original program does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation due to the missing consideration of position in case of ties. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
