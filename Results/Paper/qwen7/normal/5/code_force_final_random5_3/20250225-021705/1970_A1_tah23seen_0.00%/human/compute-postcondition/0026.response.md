Output State: **`d` must have at least one item; `i` is `n-2`; `ans` is the value of `ans` before the addition plus `s[n-1]`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += s[i]` increments `ans` by the value of `s[i]`. Given that `i` is `n-1` initially, after executing the line, `i` becomes `n-2`. The value of `ans` is updated to its previous value plus `s[n-1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
