Output State: The dictionary `d` is empty, `i` is `-1`, `ans` is the concatenation of all characters in the string `s`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the dictionary `d` will be empty because each key-value pair has been processed once. The variable `i` starts at `n-1` and decreases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `-1`. During each iteration, the character at index `i` in the string `s` is appended to `ans`. Therefore, `ans` will contain the entire string `s` concatenated together.
