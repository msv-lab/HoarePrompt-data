Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `len(s)`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0.
   - `len(s)` is the length of the string `s`, which is stored in the variable `n`.

Given this information, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(s)`. Since `len(s)` is equal to `n`, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` should be set to 0 (the initial value).
   - `n` should be set to the length of the string `s`.

The other variables (`s`, `ans`, and `d`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the length of `s`**.
