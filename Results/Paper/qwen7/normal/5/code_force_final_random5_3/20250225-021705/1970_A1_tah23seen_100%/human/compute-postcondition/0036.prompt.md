You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")". The string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is the length of `s`, and `d[n]` is the final depth value calculated based on the parentheses in `s`.
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `d` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple, and then by the negative first element of each tuple, `i` is the first element of the last tuple in `d`, `j` is the second element of the last tuple in `d`, and `ans` is the sum of all elements `s[i]` for every `i` corresponding to the first element of each tuple in `d`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `d` remains sorted as initially described, `i` and `j` will refer to the last tuple in `d`, and `ans` will hold the cumulative sum of `s[i]` for all tuples `(i, j)` in `d`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the sum of all elements `s[i]` for every `i` corresponding to the first element of each tuple in `d`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")". It returns the sum of all elements `s[i]` for every `i` corresponding to the first element of each tuple in `d`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the sum of all elements `s[i]` for every `i` corresponding to the first element of each tuple in `d`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
