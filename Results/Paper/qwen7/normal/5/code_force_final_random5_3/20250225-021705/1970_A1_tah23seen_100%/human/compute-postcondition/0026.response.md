Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `(i, j)` and the list `d`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `d`**: The list `d` is described as being sorted by the second element of each tuple, and then by the negative first element of each tuple.

3. **Understand the Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, the list `d` must contain at least one tuple. The loop will iterate over each tuple in `d`, assigning the first element of the tuple to `i` and the second element to `j`.

4. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop depends on the existence of at least one tuple in `d`, the state needs to ensure that `d` is non-empty.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is the state of the list `d`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`d` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple, and then by the negative first element of each tuple, and `d` must have at least one tuple**
