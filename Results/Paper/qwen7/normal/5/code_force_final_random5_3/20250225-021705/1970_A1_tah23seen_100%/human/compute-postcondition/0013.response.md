Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is the length of `s`, `d[2]` is `d[1] + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1` updates the value of `d[i + 1]` (which is `d[2]` since `i` is 1) to be `d[1] + 1`. The value of `d[1]` is either `d[0] + 1` or `d[0] - 1` depending on whether `s[1]` is `(` or not, but this does not affect the calculation of `d[2]` directly. The other variables remain unchanged.
