Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is the length of `s`
   - `d[2]` is either `d[1] + 1` or `d[1] - 1` depending on whether `s[1]` is `(` or not.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n`.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i`**: Since `i` starts at 1, the next iteration will increment `i` by 1, making `i` equal to 2.

5. **Determine the new value of `n`**: `n` remains unchanged as it is the length of `s`, which does not change within the loop.

6. **Adjust the state of `d[2]`**: The value of `d[2]` depends on the value of `s[1]`. Since `i` is now 2, we need to check the value of `s[1]` to determine if `d[2]` should be `d[1] + 1` or `d[1] - 1`.

Given these steps, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is the length of `s`, and `d[2]` is either `d[1] + 1` or `d[1] - 1` depending on whether `s[1]` is `(` or not.**
