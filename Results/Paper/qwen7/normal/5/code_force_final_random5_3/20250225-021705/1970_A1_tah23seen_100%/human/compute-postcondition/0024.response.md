Output State: **`d` is a list of tuples sorted by the second element of each tuple, and then by the negative first element of each tuple.**

Explanation: The code sorts the list `d`, which is assumed to be a list of tuples (`d.items()`), using the `sorted` function. The sorting is done based on the second element of each tuple (`x[1]`) and then by the negative first element of each tuple (`-x[0]`). This means that the list `d` is now ordered primarily by the second element of the tuples in ascending order, and secondarily by the first element in descending order. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
