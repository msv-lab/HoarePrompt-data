You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program:
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of characters "(" and ")`. It calculates the depth of each parenthesis in the string and stores these depths in a dictionary `d`. The dictionary is then sorted based on the depth values, and the function constructs a new string `ans` by concatenating the characters from `s` corresponding to the keys in the sorted dictionary. Finally, the function returns the sum of all elements `s[i]` for every `i` corresponding to the first element of each tuple in the sorted dictionary `d`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input string contains both opening and closing parentheses in a way that requires sorting based on the balance and position. Specifically, the program does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described. 

For example, consider the input `(()(()))`. According to the problem description, the steps should be:

1. Compute the prefix balances:
   ```
   Prefix balance | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7
   Position       | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8
   Character      | ( | ( | ) | ( | ( | ) | ) | )
   ```

2. Sort the columns by prefix balance and break ties by position:
   ```
   Prefix balance | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 3
   Position       | 1 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 7 | 5 | 3 | 6
   Character      | ( | ) | ( | ( | ) | ( | ) | )
   ```

3. Form the resulting sequence:
   ```
   Result: ()(()())
   ```

However, the program does not correctly compute the prefix balances and sort them as required. It only computes the balance up to the current index but does not store the positions correctly. Instead, it directly sorts the keys of the dictionary without considering the positions, leading to an incorrect result. 

For instance, the output for the input `(()(()))` would be `()((()))`, which is incorrect according to the problem description.
