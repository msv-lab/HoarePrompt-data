Output State: **`s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `h` is the hour part of the time input as a string, `m` is the minute part of the time input as a string, `h1` is '10', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is 'AM', and `h` is equal to '10'.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the string 'AM' to the variable `time`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
