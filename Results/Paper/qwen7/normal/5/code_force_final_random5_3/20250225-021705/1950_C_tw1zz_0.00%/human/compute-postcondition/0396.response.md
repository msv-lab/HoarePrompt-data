Output State: The loop will continue to run until all test cases provided by the user have been processed. After all iterations of the loop have finished, the following conditions will hold:

- `s` will be a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm".
- `t` will be an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, representing the total number of test cases processed.
- `h1` will be a string representing the hour in the 12-hour format with AM/PM suffix determined by the original hour `h`.
- `m1` will be the minute part of the time input as a string.
- `time` will be either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the original hour `h`.

In summary, after all the loop iterations, the program will have processed all the input times and converted them to the 12-hour format with the correct AM/PM suffix, storing the final hour (`h1`), minute (`m1`), and time format (`time`) for each input.
