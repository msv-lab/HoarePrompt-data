To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm".
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440.
   - `h` is one of the following strings: '01', '02', '03', ..., '22', or '00'.
   - `m` is the minute part of the time input as a string.
   - `h1` is derived from `h` according to specific rules:
     - If `h` is '01', then `h1` is '01'.
     - If `h` is '02', then `h1` is '02'.
     - ...
     - If `h` is '13', then `h1` is '01'.
     - If `h` is '14', then `h1` is '02'.
     - ...
     - If `h` is '22', then `h1` is '11'.
     - If `h` is '00', then `h1` is '12'.
     - If `h` is '21', then `h1` is '09'.
     - If `h` is '20', then `h1` is '08'.
     - If `h` is '19', then `h1` is '07'.
     - If `h` is '18', then `h1` is '06'.
     - If `h` is '17', then `h1` is '05'.
     - If `h` is '16', then `h1` is '04'.
     - If `h` is '15', then `h1` is '03'.
     - If `h` is '12', then `h1` is '12'.
   - `m1` is equal to `m`.
   - `time` is 'AM' if `h` is not '12' and 'PM' if `h` is '12'.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')
   ```

Given the above, the print statement will concatenate `h1`, `:`, `m`, and `time` with no separator (`sep=''`). Let's consider a few examples to illustrate:

- If `h` is '01', then `h1` is '01'.
- If `h` is '12', then `h1` is '12' and `time` is 'PM'.
- If `h` is '22', then `h1` is '11'.

In all cases, the print statement will output the hour in 12-hour format followed by a colon, the minute, and the AM/PM indicator.

Output: **h1 : m1 PM (if h is '12') or h1 : m1 AM (if h is not '12')**
