Output State: **`s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `h1` is "02", `m1` is equal to the new `m`, `time` is 'PM', `h1` is "02", `m1` is equal to the last minute of the time represented by `s`.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the string `'PM'` to the variable `time`. The values of `s`, `t`, `h1`, and `m1` remain unchanged from their initial state. Since `s` is in the format "hh:mm", `h1` remains "02" and `m1` is derived from the last part of `s`, which represents the minutes.
