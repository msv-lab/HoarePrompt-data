Postcondition: `h1` is either '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '12', '15', or '16', `m1` is equal to the string `m` from the user's input split by `:`, and `time` is 'PM' or 'AM'. If `h` is '12', then `time` is 'PM'. If `h` is '13', then `h1` is set to '01' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '14', then `h1` remains '02' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '15', then `h1` is '03' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '16', then `h1` is '04' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '17' to '23' or '00', then `h1` is updated to '05' to '12' accordingly, and `time` is 'AM'.
