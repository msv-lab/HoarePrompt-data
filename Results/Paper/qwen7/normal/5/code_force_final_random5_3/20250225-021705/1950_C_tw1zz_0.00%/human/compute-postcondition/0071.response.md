Output State: **`s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `h` is the hour part of the time input as a string, `m` is the minute part of the time input as a string, `h1` is '12', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is an empty string, and `h` is equal to '12'.**

The code `h1 = '12'` assigns the string `'12'` to the variable `h1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
