Output State: **`h1` is an empty string, `m1` is equal to the string `m` from the user's input split by ':', `time` is an empty string**.

The variable `time` is assigned an empty string, which does not affect the values of `h1` and `m1`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial state of `h1` being an empty string and `m1` being the string `m` from the user's input split by `:`.
