The function processes multiple time inputs in the format "hh:mm" and converts them to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. After processing all inputs, it prints each time in the format "h1:mm  time", where `h1` is the converted hour, `mm` is the minute, and `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM'. The function does not return any value; its primary action is to print the converted times.
