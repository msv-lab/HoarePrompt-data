Postcondition: `h1` is a string representing the hour in 12-hour format, `m1` is a list of strings representing the minutes from the user's input split by `:`, and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '07', then `h1` is '07' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is any other value from '08' to '23' or '00', `h1` is updated to the corresponding 12-hour format value, and `time` is 'AM' unless `h` is '13', in which case `h1` becomes '01', or `h` is '14', in which case `h1` remains '02', or `h` is '15', in which case `h1` becomes '03', or `h` is '16', in which case `h1` becomes '04', or `h` is '17' to '23' or '00', in which case `h1` is updated to '05' to '12' accordingly.
