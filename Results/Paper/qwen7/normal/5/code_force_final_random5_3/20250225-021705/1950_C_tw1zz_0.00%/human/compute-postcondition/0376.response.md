Postcondition: `h1` is either '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '12', '15', or '16', `m1` is equal to the string `m` from the user's input split by `:`, and `time` is 'AM' if `h` is '10' or '11'. If `h` is '12', `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '13', `h1` is set to '01'. If `h` is '14', `h1` remains '02'. If `h` is '15', `h1` is '03'. If `h` is '16', `h1` is '04'. If `h` is '17' to '23' or '00', then `h1` is updated to '05' to '12' accordingly.
