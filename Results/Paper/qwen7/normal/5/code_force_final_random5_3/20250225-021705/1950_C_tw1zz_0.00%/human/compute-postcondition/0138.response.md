Output State: **`s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `h` is '23', `m` is the minute part of the time input as a string, `h1` is '11', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is 'PM', and the condition `h != '22'` is true.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the string `'PM'` to the variable `time`. No other variables are affected. The initial conditions and values of the variables remain unchanged except for the assignment to `time`.
