Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm".
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440.
- `h1` is one of the following strings: "01", "02", "03", "04", "05", "06", "07", "08", "09", "10", "11", "12", "01", "02", "03", "04", "05", or "06".
- `m1` is equal to the new `m`.
- `time` is either 'AM'.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `h1` is explicitly defined as one of the specified strings.
2. `m` is not directly defined but is referred to as `m1` which is equal to the new `m`. Since `m` is part of the time format "hh:mm", it must be an integer between 0 and 59.
3. `time` is explicitly defined as 'AM'.

Given these details, the `print` statement will output `h1` followed by `:`, then `m`, and finally `' AM'` (since `time` is 'AM').

Output: **h1 : m AM**
