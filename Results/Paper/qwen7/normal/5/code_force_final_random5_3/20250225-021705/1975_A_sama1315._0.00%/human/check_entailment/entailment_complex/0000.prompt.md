Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

# Annotated Functions:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of positive integers with length n, where 2 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^6 for all 0 <= i < n.
def func_1(arr):
    if all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)) :
        return 'Yes'
        #The program returns 'Yes'
    #State: arr is a list of positive integers with length n, where 2 <= n <= 50 and there exists at least one index i such that 0 <= i < n-1 and arr[i] > arr[i + 1], and 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^6 for all 0 <= i < n
    return 'No' if any(arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)) else 'Yes'
    #The program returns 'No' if the list 'arr' does not contain any element that is greater than its next element, otherwise it returns 'Yes'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of positive integers `arr` and returns 'Yes' if there is at least one element in the list that is greater than its next element. Otherwise, it returns 'No'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and arr is a list of n integers where each element is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(arr)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: Output State: `index` is 10 + 2*n, `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(arr)` for each iteration, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the specified slices of `data` as per the loop's logic, `result` is the last return value of `func_1(arr)` added to the `results` list.
    #
    #In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have been executed:
    #- The variable `index` will be at the position right after the last processed array, specifically 10 plus twice the value of `n`.
    #- The variable `t` will be 0, indicating that there are no more iterations left to perform.
    #- The `results` list will contain the outputs from `func_1(arr)` for each iteration of the loop.
    #- The variable `arr` and `result` will hold the values from the last iteration of the loop, but since the loop has finished, these variables are no longer being updated and can be considered as part of the final state.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: the return values of func_1(arr) for each iteration, each on a new line
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from stdin, processes it according to specified rules, calls another function `func_1` for each set of input, collects the results, and prints them out. Specifically, it first reads an integer `t`, then for each of the next `t` sets, it reads an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers. For each set, it calls `func_1` with the list of integers, collects the result, and stores it in a list. Finally, it prints each result from the collected list on a new line.
