Output State: **`index` is 9 + `n` + `n`, `t` is 0, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the value of `result`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from `data[8 + `n` + `n` : 8 + `2*n`], `n` is an integer obtained from `data[8 + `n` + `n`]**

Explanation: The value of `index` is incremented by 1, changing its value from `8 + n + n` to `9 + n + n`. The values of `t`, `results`, `arr`, and `n` remain unchanged.
