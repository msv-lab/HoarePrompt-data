Output State: **`index` is 8 + n + n, `t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(arr)`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`**

Explanation: The code `result = func_1(arr)` assigns the return value of the function `func_1` called with the argument `arr` to the variable `result`. However, since the exact value returned by `func_1` is not specified, we only know that `results` now has one additional element, which is the return value of `func_1(arr)`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state.
