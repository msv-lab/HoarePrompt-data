Output State: **`index` is 8 + n + n, `t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `results` is a list with one additional element which is the value of `result`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`**.

Explanation: The line `results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. The other variables (`index`, `t`, and `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
