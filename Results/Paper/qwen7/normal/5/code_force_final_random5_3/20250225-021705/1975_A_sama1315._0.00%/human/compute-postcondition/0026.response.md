Output State: **`index` is 10 + `n`, `t` is 0, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the value of `result` + the original element, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from `data[9 + `n` + `n` : 9 + 2*`n`], `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`**.

Explanation: The code `results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. Since `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`, it remains unchanged. The other variables (`index`, `t`, `arr`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, their values remain the same as the initial state.
