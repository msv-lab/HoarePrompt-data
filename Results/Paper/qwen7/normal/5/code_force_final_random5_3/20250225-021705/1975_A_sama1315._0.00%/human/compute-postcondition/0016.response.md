Output State: **`index` is 8 + n, `t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(arr)`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from `data[4:7]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `arr` is updated to a list of integers obtained from `data[index:index + n]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the `arr` variable by converting the slice of `data` from `index` to `index + n` into a list of integers using the `map` function and `int`. The other variables (`index`, `t`, `results`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
