### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the problem requirements step-by-step.

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - We need to determine if an array can be made non-decreasing by splitting it into two parts (prefix and suffix) and swapping them.
   - The function `func_1` should check if the array can be made non-decreasing through such operations.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the entire array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the condition `all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`.
   - If the array is sorted, it returns `'Yes'`.
   - If the array is not sorted, it uses an additional check `any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))` to determine if there is any pair of consecutive elements where the first element is greater than the second.
     - If there is no such pair, it returns `'Yes'`.
     - Otherwise, it returns `'No'`.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes it, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the results.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The original assessment is correct in pointing out that `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted or if there are no consecutive elements where the first is greater than the second.
   - However, this is not sufficient to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts.
   - The key issue is that `func_1` does not check the condition mentioned in the problem statement: whether the maximum value in the prefix is less than or equal to the minimum value in the suffix for all possible splits.

5. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the array `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`.
     - The array is not sorted.
     - There are pairs like `(4, 1)` and `(5, 1)` where the first element is greater than the second.
     - However, this array cannot be made non-decreasing by any number of splits and swaps.
   - The function `func_1` would incorrectly return `'Yes'` because it only checks if the array is sorted or has no consecutive elements where the first is greater than the second.

Given the above analysis, the provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
