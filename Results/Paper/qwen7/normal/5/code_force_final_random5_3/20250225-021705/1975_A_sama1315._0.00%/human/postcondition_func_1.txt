The function reads input from stdin, processes it according to specified rules, calls another function `func_1` for each set of input, collects the results, and prints them out. Specifically, it first reads an integer `t`, then for each of the next `t` sets, it reads an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers. For each set, it calls `func_1` with the list of integers, collects the result, and stores it in a list. Finally, it prints each result from the collected list on a new line.
