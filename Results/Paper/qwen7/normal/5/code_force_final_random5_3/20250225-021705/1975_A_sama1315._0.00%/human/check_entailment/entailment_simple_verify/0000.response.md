### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated code to understand its behavior and correctness.

#### Function 1 (`func_1`):

```python
def func_1(arr):
    if all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)):
        return 'Yes'
    return 'No' if any(arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)) else 'Yes'
```

- **Initial State**: `arr` is a list of positive integers with length `n`, where `2 <= n <= 50` and `1 <= arr[i] <= 10^6` for all `0 <= i < n`.

- **Behavior**:
  - The function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using `all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))`.
  - If the array is already sorted, it returns `'Yes'`.
  - Otherwise, it checks if there is at least one pair `(arr[i], arr[i + 1])` where `arr[i] > arr[i + 1]` using `any(arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))`.
  - If there is such a pair, it returns `'No'`.
  - If there is no such pair, it returns `'Yes'`.

- **Issue**:
  - The function only checks if the array is already sorted or not. It does not check if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts.
  - For example, consider the array `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`. This array cannot be made non-decreasing by any number of splits and swaps, but `func_1` would incorrectly return `'Yes'` because the array is not entirely out of order.

#### Function 2 (`func_2`):

```python
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(arr)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))
```

- **Initial State**: `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`, `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 50`, and `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is an integer such that `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6`.

- **Behavior**:
  - The function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
  - It collects the results and prints them.

- **Issue**:
  - As mentioned earlier, `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts. It only checks if the array is already sorted.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts. Therefore, the final evaluation should be:

**Final: False**
