Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining if an array can be made non-decreasing by splitting it into two parts and swapping them. The given solution uses a function `func_1` to check if the array is already non-decreasing or can be made non-decreasing by the described operation.

2. **Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - If the array is already non-decreasing (`all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))`), `func_1` returns 'Yes'.
   - Otherwise, it checks if there is at least one pair of consecutive elements where the first is greater than the second (`any(arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))`). If such a pair exists, it returns 'No', otherwise 'Yes'.

3. **Analysis of `func_2`**:
   - Reads input from stdin and processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the array and calls `func_1` to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing.
   - Collects the results and prints them.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies if an array can be made non-decreasing by the described operation.
   - `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results.

Given the analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
