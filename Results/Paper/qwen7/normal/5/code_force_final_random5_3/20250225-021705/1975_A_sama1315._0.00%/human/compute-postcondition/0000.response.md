Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `arr` is a list of n integers where each element is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. The function `input` is reassigned to `sys.stdin.read`.**

Explanation: The line `input = sys.stdin.read` simply reassigns the built-in `input` function to the method `sys.stdin.read`. This does not change the values of the variables `t`, `n`, or `arr`. It only changes how the `input` function is referenced in the program.
