Based on the initial state provided:

- `index` is calculated as `10 + 2*n`.
- `t` is `0`, indicating that there are no more iterations left to perform.
- `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(arr)` for each iteration.
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the specified slices of `data` as per the loop's logic.
- `result` holds the value from the last iteration of the loop, but since the loop has finished, it is no longer being updated and can be considered as part of the final state.

The code snippet `print('\n'.join(results))` will join all elements of the `results` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`). Therefore, the output will be a string where each line corresponds to one of the return values from `func_1(arr)` during the iterations of the loop.

Output: **the return values of func_1(arr) for each iteration, each on a new line**
