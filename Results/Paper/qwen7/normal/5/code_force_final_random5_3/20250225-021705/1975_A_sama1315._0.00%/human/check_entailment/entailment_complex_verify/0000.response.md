### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated code step-by-step to evaluate the correctness of the program.

#### Function `func_1`:
- The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the `all` function. If the array is sorted, it returns `'Yes'`.
- If the array is not sorted, it uses the `any` function to check if there is at least one element that is greater than its next element. If such an element is found, it returns `'No'`. Otherwise, it returns `'Yes'`.

However, the function `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted or not. It does not check if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts as described in the problem statement.

#### Function `func_2`:
- The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes it, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
- It correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the results.

#### Annotated Code:
- The annotated code provides a detailed breakdown of the states of the program at different points, which helps in understanding the flow and behavior of the functions.

#### Example Analysis:
- Consider the array `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`.
  - `func_1` will return `'Yes'` because the array is not entirely out of order, but it is not sorted.
  - According to the problem statement, this array cannot be made non-decreasing by any number of splits and swaps.
  - Therefore, `func_1` is incorrect for this case.

- Consider the array `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`.
  - `func_1` will return `'No'` because the array is not sorted.
  - The array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts as shown in the problem statement.
  - Therefore, `func_1` is incorrect for this case as well.

- Consider the array `[1, 2, 3]`.
  - `func_1` will return `'Yes'` because the array is already sorted.
  - The array is already non-decreasing, so this is correct.

Based on the analysis, the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts. It only checks if the array is already sorted, which is insufficient.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts.
