Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The variables involved here are `t`.

2. **Understand the current state**: 
   - `index` is `7 + n`.
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(arr)`.
   - `arr` is a list of integers obtained from `data[4:7]`.
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `t` must still be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `t` is the only variable in the loop head, it is the only one that needs to be adjusted.
   - After each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1 (since it is iterating over `range(t)`).

5. **Calculate the new state**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `t` was greater than 0.
   - For the loop to execute again, `t` must be decremented by 1 but still remain greater than 0.

Therefore, the new state should reflect that `t` is now `t - 1` and still greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`index` is 7 + n, `t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(arr)`, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from `data[4:7]`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`**
