Output State: `index` is 10 + 2*n, `t` is 0, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(arr)` for each iteration, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the specified slices of `data` for each iteration, `result` is the last return value of `func_1(arr)` added to the `results` list.

This means after the loop has executed all its iterations, `index` will be at the position right after the last `arr` slice was processed, `t` will be 0 as it gets decremented until it reaches 0, `results` will contain the results of `func_1(arr)` for each iteration, and `arr` will be the last list of integers processed by `func_1`.
