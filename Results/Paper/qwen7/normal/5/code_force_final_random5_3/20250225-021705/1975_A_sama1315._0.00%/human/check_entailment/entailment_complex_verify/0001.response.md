### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that both `func_1` and `func_2` are implemented correctly according to the problem statement. However, the original assessment makes an assumption that the function `func_1` correctly determines whether an array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts of the array. This assumption needs to be validated.

Let's re-evaluate the core logic of `func_1` to ensure it accurately addresses the problem requirements:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is already sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the array is not sorted, it returns 'No'.

However, the problem requires checking if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts of the array. The function `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted, which is a sufficient condition but not a necessary one for the problem.

To correctly solve the problem, the function should consider the possibility of rearranging the array through the described operations. Here's a more detailed analysis:

- **Correct Approach**:
  - The array can be made non-decreasing if it can be split into two parts such that the first part is non-increasing and the second part is non-decreasing.
  - Additionally, the last element of the first part must be less than or equal to the first element of the second part.

Given this, the function `func_1` should be modified to check these conditions instead of just checking if the array is sorted.

### Corrected `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if arr[i] > arr[i + 1]:
            # Check if the array can be split into two parts as required
            for j in range(i, n - 1):
                if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                    return 'No'
            if i == 0 or arr[i - 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
                return 'Yes'
            else:
                return 'No'
    return 'Yes'
```

### Corrected `func_2`:
The function `func_2` remains the same as it correctly processes the input and calls the corrected `func_1`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly assumed that `func_1` was sufficient to solve the problem. The corrected approach ensures that the function checks the necessary conditions for the array to be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts.

**Final: False**
