Output State: **`index` is 7 + `n`, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from `data[4:7]`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`**.

Explanation: The code `result = func_1(arr)` calls the function `func_1` with the argument `arr`. The function `func_1` processes the list `arr` and returns a value, which is assigned to `result`. The values of `index`, `t`, and `results` remain unchanged from their initial state. The list `arr` is still defined as `data[4:7]`, and `results` remains an empty list until the function `func_1` populates it.
