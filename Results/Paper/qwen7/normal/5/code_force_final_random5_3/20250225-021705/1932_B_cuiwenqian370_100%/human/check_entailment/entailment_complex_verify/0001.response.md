### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the steps and logic of the program. Let's break down the program and verify each part:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the entire input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It initializes an index variable to keep track of the current position in the data list.

2. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - For each test case, it extracts the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `a`.
   - It calculates the year when the last sign occurs by iterating through the periodicities and updating the `last_year` accordingly.

3. **Calculating the Year**:
   - The formula used to calculate the next year is:
     \[
     \text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{\text{last\_year} + 1 + a[i] - 1}{a[i]} \right) \times a[i]
     \]
     Simplifying the formula:
     \[
     \text{next\_year} = \left\lceil \frac{\text{last\_year} + 1}{a[i]} \right\rceil \times a[i]
     \]
     This formula ensures that `next_year` is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`.

4. **Storing Results**:
   - It stores the final year for each test case in the `results` list.

5. **Output**:
   - It writes the results to the standard output, joining them with newlines.

### Detailed Verification

1. **Formula Verification**:
   - The formula used in the program is correct. It ensures that the next year is a multiple of `a[i]` and strictly greater than `last_year`.

2. **Logic Flow**:
   - The logic flow is correct. It correctly updates `last_year` for each sign and calculates the correct year when the last sign occurs.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles multiple test cases efficiently by reading all input at once and processing each one sequentially.
   - It correctly handles the periodicities and ensures that the years are calculated correctly.

### Conclusion

After re-evaluating the program and its logic, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year when the nth sign occurs, ensuring that the years are calculated accurately according to the problem description.

### Final Answer

Final: **True**
