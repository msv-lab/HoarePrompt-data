Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `last_year` is equal to `next_year`, `next_year` is equal to ((`last_year` + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2] * a[2])**.

Explanation: The code updates `last_year` to be equal to `next_year`. Since `next_year` was already defined as ((`last_year` + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2] * a[2]), after the assignment, `last_year` now holds the same value as `next_year`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `last_year`, and `next_year`) remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
