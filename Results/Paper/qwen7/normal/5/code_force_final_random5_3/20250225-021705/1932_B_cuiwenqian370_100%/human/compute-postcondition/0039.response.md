Output State: `i` is `n`, `last_year` is `(last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]`, `next_year` is undefined, `last_year` is updated to the value of `next_year`, `results` is a list of integers.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`. The `last_year` variable will be updated to the value of `next_year` after the last iteration, which is calculated as `(last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]`. The `next_year` variable will be undefined outside the loop since it is only used within the loop body. The `results` list remains unchanged as it was not modified within the loop.
