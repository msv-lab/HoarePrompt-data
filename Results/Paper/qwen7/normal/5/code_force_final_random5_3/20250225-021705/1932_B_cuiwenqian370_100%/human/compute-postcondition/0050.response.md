Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `last_year` is equal to `next_year`**

Explanation: The code `last_year = next_year` assigns the current value of `next_year` to `last_year`. Since `next_year` is defined as `(last_year + 1 + a[1] - 1) // a[1] * a[1]`, and `last_year` is updated to this value, `last_year` now holds the same value as `next_year`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
