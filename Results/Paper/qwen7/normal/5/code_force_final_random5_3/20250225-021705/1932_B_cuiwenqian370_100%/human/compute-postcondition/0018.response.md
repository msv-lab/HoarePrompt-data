Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` and the range `1, n`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be 4 if the loop continues.

4. **Adjust the state of `i`**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be 4.

5. **Determine the state of `n`**: Since the problem does not specify any change to `n` within the loop body and the loop condition depends on `i < n`, `n` remains unchanged from its previous value.

6. **Adjust the state of `last_year` and `next_year`**: The problem states that `last_year` is updated based on `a[2]` but `next_year` is not affected. These values are not part of the loop head, so they remain unchanged.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 4, `last_year` is equal to (last_year + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2] * a[2], and `next_year` is not affected**
