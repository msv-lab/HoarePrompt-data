Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is initialized to 1 and incremented by 1 in each iteration. The loop runs from `1` to `n-1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i` being 1, we need to ensure that `i` is set to 1 at the beginning of the loop.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that `i` is initially set to 1 and that `i` remains less than `n` throughout the loop execution.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be 1.
- `i` should be less than `n`.

Since the other variables (`T`, `index`, `a`, and `last_year`) are not directly involved in the loop head and their values do not affect the loop's execution condition, they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `i` must be less than `n`**
