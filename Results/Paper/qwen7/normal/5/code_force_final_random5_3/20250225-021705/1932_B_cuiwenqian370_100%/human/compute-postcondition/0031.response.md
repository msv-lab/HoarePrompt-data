Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `last_year` is `a[0]`, `results` is a list of integers, `next_year` is `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `next_year` using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`. Here, `last_year` is the first element of the list `a`, and `i` is incremented by 1. The value of `next_year` is computed based on the current `last_year` and the value of `a[i]` at the updated index `i`. The other variables remain unchanged.
