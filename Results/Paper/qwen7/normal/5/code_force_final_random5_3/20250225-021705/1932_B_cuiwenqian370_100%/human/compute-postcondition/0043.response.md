Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `last_year` is `(last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]`, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `(last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[index]` to `n`, which is an integer. The other variables (`T`, `i`, `last_year`, `results`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[index]`.
