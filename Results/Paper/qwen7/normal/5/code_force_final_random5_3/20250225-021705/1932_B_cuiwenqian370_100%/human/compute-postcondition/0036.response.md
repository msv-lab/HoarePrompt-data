Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is `i + 2`
- `last_year` is `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`
- `results` is a list of integers
- `next_year` is `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`
- `last_year` is now equal to `next_year`

### Loop Head
```
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts from `i = 1` and increments by 1 each iteration.
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, if `i` was `i + 2` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `i + 3` at the start of the next iteration.

2. **Variables `last_year` and `next_year`:**
   - Both `last_year` and `next_year` are updated based on the same formula: `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`.
   - Since `last_year` is now equal to `next_year` at the end of the previous iteration, they both hold the same value.

3. **List `results`:**
   - The list `results` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.

### Adjusting the States
- `i` needs to be adjusted to `i + 3`.
- `last_year` and `next_year` need to be adjusted to their new values based on the updated `i`.

### Calculation for New Values
- Given `i` is `i + 2` at the end of the previous iteration, the new `i` will be `i + 3`.
- The new `last_year` and `next_year` will be calculated using the formula: `(last_year + 1 + a[i+3] - 1) // a[i+3] * a[i+3]`.

### Final State
- `i` is `i + 3`
- `last_year` and `next_year` are both updated to the new value based on the formula.

### Answer
State: **`i` is `i + 3`, `last_year` and `next_year` are both updated to the new value based on the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i+3] - 1) // a[i+3] * a[i+3]`**
