Output State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `last_year` is `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`, `results` is a list of integers, `next_year` is `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`, `last_year` is now equal to `next_year`**.

Explanation: The line `last_year = next_year` simply assigns the current value of `next_year` to `last_year`. The values of `i`, `last_year`, `results`, and `next_year` remain unchanged from their previous states. The only change is that `last_year` is now equal to `next_year`.
