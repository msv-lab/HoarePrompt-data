You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        last_year = a[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
            last_year = next_year
        results.append(str(last_year))
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it takes an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. It then applies a specific update rule to each element in the list `a` for `n-1` iterations, storing the final computed value in a list. Finally, it outputs the computed values for each test case, one per line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read()`.
   - It splits the input into a list of strings.
   - It initializes an index variable to keep track of the current position in the data list.

2. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - For each test case, it extracts the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `a`.
   - It calculates the year when the last sign occurs by iterating through the periodicities and updating the `last_year` accordingly.

3. **Calculating the Year**:
   - For each periodicity `a[i]`, it calculates the next year when the sign will occur after the previous sign has occurred.
   - This calculation uses the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` to find the next multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`.

4. **Storing Results**:
   - It stores the final year for each test case in the `results` list.

5. **Output**:
   - It writes the results to the standard output, joining them with newlines.

### Correctness Check

1. **Formula Verification**:
   - The formula used to calculate the next year is correct. It ensures that the next year is a multiple of `a[i]` and strictly greater than `last_year`.

2. **Logic Flow**:
   - The logic flow is correct. It correctly updates `last_year` for each sign and calculates the correct year when the last sign occurs.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles multiple test cases efficiently by reading all input at once and processing each one sequentially.
   - It correctly handles the periodicities and ensures that the years are calculated correctly.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic and calculations are correct according to the problem description. The program processes the input correctly and computes the required years accurately.
