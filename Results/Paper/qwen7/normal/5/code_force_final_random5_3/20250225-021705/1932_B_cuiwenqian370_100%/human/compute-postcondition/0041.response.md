Output State: **`i` is `n`, `last_year` is `(last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]`, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `(last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]`, `next_year` is undefined.**

Explanation: The code appends the string representation of `last_year` to the `results` list. Given the initial state, `last_year` is updated to the value of `(last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1] * a[n-1]` after the loop. Since the `results` list was not modified within the loop, it remains unchanged except for the new element added. The `i` variable is set to `n` after the loop completes, and `next_year` is undefined as it was not defined or modified outside the loop.
