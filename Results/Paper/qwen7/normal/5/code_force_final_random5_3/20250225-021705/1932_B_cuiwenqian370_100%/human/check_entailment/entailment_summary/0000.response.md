Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by reading input from standard input, processing each test case, and calculating the year when the nth sign will occur. Let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read`, splits the input into tokens, and processes them.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `a`.
   - It initializes `last_year` with the first periodicity `a[0]`.
   - For each subsequent sign (from the second to the nth), it calculates the next year when the sign will occur. This calculation is done correctly by finding the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`.
3. **Output**: The program stores the final computed year for each test case and outputs these values.

Given the execution summary, the program follows the correct logic to compute the year when the nth sign will occur for each test case. The logic for updating `last_year` to find the next occurrence of the sign is accurate.

Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
