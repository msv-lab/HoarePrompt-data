Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the operation described in the problem statement. According to the problem, in one operation, Rudolf can choose an index \(i\) (where \(2 \le i \le n-1\)) and perform the following assignments:

- \(a_{i-1} = a_{i-1} - 1\)
- \(a_i = a_i - 2\)
- \(a_{i+1} = a_{i+1} - 1\)

However, the program incorrectly implements this operation. Specifically, the program subtracts \(b[i]\) from \(b[i+1]\) and \(b[i+2]\), which does not match the required operation. This leads to incorrect results for many test cases.

For example, consider the input:

```
5
1 3 5 5 2
```

The correct approach would involve repeatedly applying the operation until all elements are zero or determining that it's impossible. However, the current implementation does not correctly simulate these operations and may produce incorrect results.
