Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is greater than 2, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, and the value of `b[i + 2]` is reduced by the value of `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `b[i + 2] -= b[i]` reduces the value of `b[i + 2]` by the value of `b[i]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
