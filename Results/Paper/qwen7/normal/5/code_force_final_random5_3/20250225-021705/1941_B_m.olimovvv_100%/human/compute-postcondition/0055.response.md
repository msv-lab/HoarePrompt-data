Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is greater than 2, `b` is a list of integers where each element `b[i+1]` is equal to `b[i+1] - 2 * b[i]` for all `i`, `i` is `a - 1`, and `b[i]` is 0. If `b[i]` is less than 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
