Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is greater than 2, `b` is a list of integers where each element `b[i]` is 0 for all `i`, and `i` is \(a - 3\); `b[i + 2]` is decreased by `b[i]` which results in 0 since `b[i]` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `b[i + 2] -= b[i]` decreases the value of `b[i + 2]` by the value of `b[i]`. Since `b[i]` is 0, subtracting 0 from `b[i + 2]` does not change the value of `b[i + 2]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
