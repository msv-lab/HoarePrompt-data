Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer such that \(a \geq 3\) (since the loop runs for `a - 2` times, meaning it needs at least 3 elements in the list `b` to complete its iterations), `b` is a list of integers where each element is equal to the integer input split by spaces, and after all iterations, `b[-1]` and `b[-2]` are both 0.

This final state is derived from the fact that the loop continues to modify the list `b` according to the given rules until either a negative number is encountered (which breaks the loop and prints 'NO'), or the loop completes its iterations and checks if the last two elements of `b` are zero (which would result in printing 'YES'). Since we know the loop executed fully up to 3 iterations, and assuming no negative numbers were encountered, the only possible outcome is that the conditions inside the `else` block are met, leading to `b[-1]` and `b[-2]` becoming 0.
