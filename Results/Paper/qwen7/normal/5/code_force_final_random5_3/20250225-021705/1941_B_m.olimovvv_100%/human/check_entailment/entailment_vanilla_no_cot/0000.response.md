Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The main issues are:

1. **Incorrect Operation Application**: The solution attempts to apply the operation in a way that doesn't match the problem's requirements. Specifically, it tries to directly subtract values without properly handling the conditions under which the operation can be applied.

2. **Logic Flaw**: The solution checks if `b[i] < 0` for each `i` and prints 'NO' immediately if any element becomes negative. However, this approach does not guarantee that the array can be made zero. It only checks a condition but does not ensure that the array can be reduced to all zeros through the allowed operations.

3. **Final Check**: The final check `if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:` is also flawed because it does not account for the possibility that intermediate values might still need to be adjusted to zero after applying the operation multiple times.

### Correct Solution:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that the sum of the array elements is even and that no element is greater than twice the sum of the subsequent elements. Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate the prefix sums
        prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(n):
            prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + b[i]
        
        # Check if the total sum is even
        if prefix_sum[-1] % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        # Check if it's possible to make all elements zero
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if b[i] > prefix_sum[i + 1]:
                print('NO')
                break
        else:
            print('YES')

func()
```

This solution works by first calculating the prefix sums of the array. Then, it checks if the total sum is even and whether each element is less than or equal to the sum of the subsequent elements. If these conditions are met, it is possible to make all elements zero.
