Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains `_` (which is a placeholder indicating that the loop variable is not used) and `int(input())`. The only variable that changes within the loop is the number of iterations, which is determined by `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `a` is greater than 2
   - `b` is a list of integers where each element `b[i]` is 0 for all `i`
   - `i` is \(a - 2\)

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for a number of times equal to `int(input())`. After each iteration, the number of remaining iterations decreases by 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - The number of iterations left to run is now one less than it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - The value of `i` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the loop itself.
   - The list `b` and the value of `a` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- The number of iterations left is `int(input()) - 1`.
- `t` remains within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` remains greater than 2.
- `b` remains a list of integers where each element `b[i]` is 0 for all `i`.
- `i` remains \(a - 2\).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is greater than 2, `b` is a list of integers where each element `b[i]` is 0 for all `i`, and `i` is \(a - 2\)**.
