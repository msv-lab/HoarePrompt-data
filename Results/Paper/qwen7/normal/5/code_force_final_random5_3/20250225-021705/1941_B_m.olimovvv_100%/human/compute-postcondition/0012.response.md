Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is greater than 2, `b` is a list of integers where each element b[i] is reduced by itself, resulting in b[i] being 0 for all i.**

Explanation: The code snippet `b[i] -= b[i]` subtracts the value of `b[i]` from itself, which results in `b[i]` becoming 0. This operation is applied to the element at index `i` in the list `b`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact indices or values of `b`, we only know that every element in `b` will be set to 0 after executing this line of code. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged.
