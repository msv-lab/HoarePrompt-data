Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `a`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `0` to `a - 2`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i < a - 2`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `a` must be at least 2.
   - `b` is a list of integers where each element is equal to the integer input split by spaces.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `b[i]` is decreased by `b[i]`, resulting in `b[i]` being 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 2.
   - The value of `a` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop head.

5. **Check if the loop condition is satisfied**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `a - 2`.
   - Given `i` is now 2, the loop will execute again if `2 < a - 2`, which simplifies to `a > 4`.

6. **Update the state**:
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `a` must still be at least 2, but to satisfy the loop condition, `a` must be greater than 4.
   - `b` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is now 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` must be greater than 4, `b` is a list of integers where each element is equal to the integer input split by spaces, `i` is 2.**
