Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` must be at least 2, `b` is a list of integers where each element is equal to the integer input split by spaces, `i` is 1, `b[i + 2]` is decreased by `2 * b[i]`**.

Explanation: The code `b[i + 2] -= b[i]` decreases the value of `b[i + 2]` by `2 * b[i]`. Given that `i` is 1, this means `b[3]` (since indexing starts at 0) is decreased by `2 * b[1]`. The values of `t`, `a`, and `b[1]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `b[3]` which is `b[3] - 2 * b[1]`.
