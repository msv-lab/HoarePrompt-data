Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is greater than 2, `b` is a list of integers where each element `b[i+1]` is decreased by twice the value of the current element `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2` modifies the value of `b[i + 1]` by subtracting twice the value of `b[i]` from it. The other variables `t` and `a` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. The condition to break out of the loop or if statement based on the value of elements in `b` is not specified in the given code snippet, so it is assumed that the modification continues unless explicitly stated otherwise.
