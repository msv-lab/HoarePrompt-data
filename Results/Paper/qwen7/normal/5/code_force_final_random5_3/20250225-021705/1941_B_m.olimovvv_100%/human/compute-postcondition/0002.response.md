Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer**.

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `b`. The values of `t` and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
