Based on the initial state provided, `out` is a list that must have at least one element. However, the variables `t` and `p` are not defined in the initial state. Since their values are not specified, we cannot determine their exact values.

Therefore, the output will include placeholders for `t` and `p`, along with the string 'ELIMINATED'.

Output: **t, p, 'ELIMINATED'**
