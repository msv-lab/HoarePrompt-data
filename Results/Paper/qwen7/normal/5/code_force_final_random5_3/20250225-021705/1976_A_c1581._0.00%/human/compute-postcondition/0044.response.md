Output State: The loop has executed all iterations, and `last_digit_index` is either 9 (if any digit was found in the password) or remains -1 (if no digit was found in the password). The function will have returned 'NO' if a digit was found and `last_digit_index` was not -1 before the current iteration, causing the loop to terminate early.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `last_digit_index` will be set to the index of the last digit found in the `password` string, or it will remain -1 if no digits were found. If the function returned 'NO' during any iteration, the final value of `last_digit_index` does not matter as the function would have stopped executing further iterations.
