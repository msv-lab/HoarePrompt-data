The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `password`. `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where `1 <= n <= 20`, and each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit. The function does not provide specific conditions for returning 'YES', only 'NO' in all cases mentioned. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a password string and always return 'NO'.
