Reasoning:
- The program reads multiple test cases from standard input and processes each one individually.
- For each password, the program correctly separates the characters into two lists: `digits` and `letters`.
- It checks if there is a digit immediately followed by a letter and returns "NO" if such a sequence is found.
- It then checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns "NO".
- Finally, it checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns "NO".
- If all checks pass, it returns "YES".

However, there are a few issues with the logic in the provided program:
1. The function `func_1` does not handle the case where there are no digits in the password. In this case, the check for `digits` being sorted is unnecessary and could lead to incorrect results.
2. The check for digits coming after letters is done correctly, but the logic can be simplified.
3. The final checks for sorting `digits` and `letters` are redundant because the initial separation ensures that `digits` and `letters` are only populated with the respective types of characters.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    
    # Check if there is a digit immediately followed by a letter
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isdigit() and password[i + 1].isalpha():
            return 'NO'
    
    # Check if digits are sorted
    if digits and digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    
    # Check if letters are sorted
    if letters and letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    
    return 'YES'
```

Given the above corrections, the original program logic is flawed, but the essence of the checks is correct. Therefore, the provided program is **incorrect** due to the unnecessary checks and the lack of handling the case where there are no digits.

Correctness: **False**
