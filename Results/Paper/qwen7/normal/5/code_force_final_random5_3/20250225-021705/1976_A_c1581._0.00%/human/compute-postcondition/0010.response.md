Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `password` is a non-empty string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where `1 <= n <= 20`.
- Each character in `password` is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.
- `digits` is a list containing at least one digit from `password` if `char` is a digit, otherwise it remains an empty list.
- `letters` is a list containing all the characters from the `password` string that are not digits, with one additional character appended to it if `char` is a letter.

### Loop Head
The loop iterates over each character in the `password` string. The loop head involves the variable `char`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Determine the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `char`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in `password` to iterate over.
3. **State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `password` is a non-empty string.
   - `digits` contains at least one digit (if `char` was a digit).
   - `letters` contains all non-digit characters plus one additional character (if `char` was a letter).

### Adjusting the States
- Since `char` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to adjust its value for the next iteration.
- For the loop to continue, `char` must be the next character in the `password` string.
- After processing the current character, `password` will have one less character.

### New State
- `password` will now be the original `password` minus the first character.
- `digits` will remain the same unless the first character of `password` was a digit, in which case `digits` will still contain at least one digit.
- `letters` will remain the same unless the first character of `password` was a letter, in which case `letters` will still contain all non-digit characters plus one additional character.

### Final Answer
State: **`password` is a non-empty string consisting of exactly n-1 characters, where `1 <= n-1 <= 19`, and each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit; `digits` is a list containing at least one digit from `password` if the first character was a digit, otherwise it remains the same; `letters` is a list containing all the characters from the `password` string that are not digits, with one additional character appended to it if the first character was a letter.**
