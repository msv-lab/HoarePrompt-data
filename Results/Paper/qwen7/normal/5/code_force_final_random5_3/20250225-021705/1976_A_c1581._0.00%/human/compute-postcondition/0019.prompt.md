Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `password` is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where 1 <= n <= 20, and each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit; `digits` is an empty list; `letters` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for char in password:
    if char.isdigit():
        digits.append(char)
    else:
        letters.append(char)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `password` is a non-empty string consisting of exactly n characters, where 1 <= n <= 20, and each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit; `digits` is a list containing at least one digit from `password` if `char` is a digit, otherwise it remains an empty list; `letters` is a list containing all the characters from the `password` string that are not digits, with one additional character appended to it if `char` is a letter.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `password` is a non-empty string consisting of exactly n-1 characters, `digits` is a list containing at least one digit from `password` if the first character was a digit, otherwise it remains the same; `letters` is a list containing all the characters from the `password` string that are not digits, with one additional character appended to it if the first character was a letter, and in both cases (`char` is appended to `digits` or the new character is appended to `letters`), the final state of `digits` and `letters` reflects the original conditions specified in the if and else parts.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `password` is a non-empty string consisting of exactly \( n-2 \) characters, `char` is the current character from `password`, `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password`, and `letters` is a list containing all the characters from the `password` string that are not digits, with one additional character appended to it if the first character was a letter.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
