Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where both letters and digits are present in the password and the digits are not sorted in non-decreasing order. For example, consider the password `123abc`. According to the problem description, this password should be classified as "NO" because the digits `1`, `2`, and `3` are not sorted in non-decreasing order. However, the current implementation will incorrectly classify this password as "YES".

To fix this, the program needs to check the sorted order of digits after ensuring that there are no digits coming after letters. Here is a modified version of the `func_1` function that addresses this issue:

```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    
    # Check if there is a digit after a letter
    last_digit_index = -1
    for i, char in enumerate(password):
        if char.isdigit():
            last_digit_index = i
        elif last_digit_index != -1:
            return 'NO'
    
    # Check if digits are sorted in non-decreasing order
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    
    # Check if letters are sorted in non-decreasing order
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    
    return 'YES'
```

This modification ensures that the program correctly identifies passwords that do not meet the criteria for having digits sorted in non-decreasing order.
