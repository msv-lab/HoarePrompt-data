Output State: **All characters from the original `password` string have been processed, and `digits` contains every digit from the `password`, while `letters` contains every character from `password` that is not a digit.**

In this final state, the variable `password` will be an empty string because all its characters have been iterated over and moved into either the `digits` or `letters` lists. The `digits` list will contain every digit that was originally in the `password` string, and the `letters` list will contain every character from the `password` string that was not a digit.
