Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head defines the variables `i` and `char` as follows:
   ```python
   for (i, char) in enumerate(password):
   ```

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `last_digit_index` is 0 if the first character in `password` is a digit, otherwise it remains -1.
   - `password` is a string.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `char` is the first character in `password`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are more characters in the `password` string.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be `1` because `enumerate` starts counting from 0.
   - `char` will now be the second character in the `password` string.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `last_digit_index` remains unchanged unless the second character is a digit, but since we are only adjusting the loop head variables, we don't change `last_digit_index` here.
   - `password` remains the same.
   - `i` becomes 1.
   - `char` becomes the second character in the `password`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`last_digit_index` is 0 if the first character in `password` is a digit, otherwise it remains -1, `password` is a string, `i` is 1, and `char` is the second character in `password`.**
