Postcondition: `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, which is the number of unique integers from `w` that have a count greater than 0 in `q`. If `eta_ln` equals 1, then `rho` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `rho` is set to the sum of `q[eta[j]]` for all `j` in `eta`, and additional calculations involving `res` are performed based on the values in `eta`.
