Output State: **`t` remains the same, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an integer input by the user, and `w` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, and `w`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
