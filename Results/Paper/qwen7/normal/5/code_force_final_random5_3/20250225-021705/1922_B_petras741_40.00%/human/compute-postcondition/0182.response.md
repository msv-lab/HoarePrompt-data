Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `j` and the condition `range(1, eta_ln)`. Therefore, the variables that can be adjusted are `j` and `eta_ln`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range `1` to `eta_ln - 1`. Given that `j` is initially greater than 1001, it means `j` is already in the valid range for the current iteration.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `j` is greater than 1001, it will still be within the range `1` to `eta_ln - 1` for the next iteration unless `eta_ln` changes.
   - The value of `j` will increase by 1 in the next iteration because the loop iterates from `1` to `eta_ln - 1`.

4. **Consider the Break Condition**: The break condition is `if j > 1000`, which is already true since `j` is greater than 1001. This means the loop will continue regardless of this condition.

5. **Update the State**: For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it `j + 1`, and `eta_ln` must remain greater than 1001.

**Final State**:
State: **`j` is greater than 1002, `eta_ln` must be greater than 1001**
