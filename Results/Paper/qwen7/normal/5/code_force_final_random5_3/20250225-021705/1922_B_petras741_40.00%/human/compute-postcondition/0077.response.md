Output State: `t` remains the same, `i` remains the same, `n` must be greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `q` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is 0 except for the elements at indices `w[j]` which are incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `q` will have been updated such that for each unique value in the list `w`, the corresponding index in `q` will have its count incremented according to how many times that value appears in `w`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged, as well as the state of `w` and `q` outside the specific indices that were incremented.
