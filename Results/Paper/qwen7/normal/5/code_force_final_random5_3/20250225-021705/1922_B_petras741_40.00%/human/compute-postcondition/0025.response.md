Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `eta` is an empty list.
   - `j` is `n`.
   - `n` must be at least 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `j` in `range(n + 1)`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - `j` is equal to `n`.
   - `n` is at least 1.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` will become `n + 1`.

5. **Check Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will check if `j` is less than `n + 1`.
   - Since `j` is now `n + 1`, the condition `j < n + 1` will be false, and the loop will terminate.

6. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we need to adjust `j` to `n + 1`.
   - The value of `n` does not change within the loop head, so it remains the same.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

State: **`eta` is an empty list, `j` is `n + 1`, and `n` must be at least 1**.
