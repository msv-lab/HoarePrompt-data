Postcondition: **`j` is greater than 1000, `eta_ln` must be greater than `j`, `res` is increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, and `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]]`. If `j` is not greater than 1000, the conditions for `eta_ln` and `res` remain as they were before the if-else block.**
