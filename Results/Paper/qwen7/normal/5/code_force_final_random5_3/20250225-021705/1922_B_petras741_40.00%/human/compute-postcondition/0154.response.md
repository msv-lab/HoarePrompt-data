Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `eta` is a list.
   - `j` is `n`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - Each element in the list `q` has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of the corresponding index in the list `w`.
   - If `q[n]` is greater than 0, then `eta` contains `j`. Otherwise, `eta` remains an empty list.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for j in range(n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The loop variable `j` starts from 0 and goes up to `n`.
   - After the previous iteration, `j` is equal to `n`.
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it `n + 1`.

4. **Conditions to Check:**
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1, the new value of `j` will be `n + 1`.
   - We need to check if `n + 1` is within the range of `range(n + 1)`. This means `n + 1` should be less than or equal to `n + 1` (which is always true).

5. **Modifying the States:**
   - `j` will be updated to `n + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified inside the loop.
   - The list `eta` remains unchanged as well since the condition for adding `j` to `eta` is based on the value of `q[n]`, which is not affected by the loop incrementing `j`.

6. **Final States:**
   - `j` is now `n + 1`.
   - `n` remains greater than 0.
   - The list `eta` remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`eta` is a list, `j` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, and each element in the list `q` has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of the corresponding index in the list `w`. If `q[n]` is greater than 0, then `eta` contains `j`. Otherwise, `eta` remains an empty list.**
