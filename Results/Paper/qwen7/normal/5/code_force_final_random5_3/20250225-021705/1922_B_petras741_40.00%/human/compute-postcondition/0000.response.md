Output State: **t is an input integer, and the value of t is within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**

The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, the output state reflects that `t` now holds the value of the input integer, which is within the specified range. All other preconditions remain unchanged.
