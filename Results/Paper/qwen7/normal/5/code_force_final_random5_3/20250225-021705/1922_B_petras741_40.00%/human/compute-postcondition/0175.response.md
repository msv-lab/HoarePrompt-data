Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `eta_ln`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `eta_ln`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is greater than 1000.
   - `eta_ln` must be greater than `j`.
   - `res` is increased by a specific value based on `q[eta[j]]` and `rho`.
   - `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]]`.

4. **Check if the loop can continue**:
   - Since `j` is greater than 1000, we need to check if `eta_ln` is still greater than `j` for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - If `eta_ln` is still greater than `j`, the loop can continue.
   - `j` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.
   - `eta_ln` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise in the loop body, but since no such change is mentioned, it stays the same.
   - `res` and `rho` will be updated based on the new value of `j` in the next iteration.

Given that `j` is greater than 1000 and `eta_ln` must be greater than `j`, for the loop to continue, `eta_ln` must be greater than `j + 1` (since `j` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` becomes `j + 1`.
- `eta_ln` must be greater than `j + 1`.

So, the final state is:
State: **`j` is greater than 1001, `eta_ln` must be greater than 1001**
