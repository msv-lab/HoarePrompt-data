Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head includes the variable `j` and the condition `range(n + 1)`.
2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n + 1`.
3. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `q` is a list of integers, `eta` is a list containing the value `j`, and if `q[j]` is greater than 0, then `q[j]` remains unchanged and `eta` contains the value `j`. If `q[j]` is not greater than 0, then all variables retain their values from the precondition.

Given this information, let's analyze the state adjustments needed for the next iteration:

- **Variable `j`**: The loop increments `j` by 1 at each iteration. Therefore, if `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `k + 1` at the start of the next iteration.
- **List `q`**: The list `q` remains unchanged unless `q[j]` is greater than 0, but since we are considering the state before the condition check, we assume `q` retains its previous state.
- **List `eta`**: The list `eta` will contain the value of `j` from the previous iteration. For the next iteration, `eta` will contain the new value of `j`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `k + 1` (where `k` was the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration), and `eta` will contain the value of `j` from the previous iteration, which is `k`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize the state as follows:

**State:**
- `q` is a list of integers.
- `eta` is a list containing the value of `j` from the previous iteration.
- `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration can be described as:

State: **`q` is a list of integers, `eta` is a list containing the value of `j` from the previous iteration, and `j` is incremented by 1**.
