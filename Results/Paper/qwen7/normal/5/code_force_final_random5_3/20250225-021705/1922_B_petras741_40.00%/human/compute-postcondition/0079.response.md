Output State: **`t` remains the same, `i` remains the same, `n` must be greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `q` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is 0 except for the elements at indices corresponding to integers present in `w` which are incremented by 1 for every occurrence of those integers in `w`, and `eta` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The given code initializes an empty list `eta`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `w`, or `q`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The only change is the creation of the empty list `eta`.
