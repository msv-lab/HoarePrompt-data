Postcondition: `eta` is a list containing the element `j`, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, `n` is greater than 0, and each element in the list `q` has been incremented by 1 for each occurrence of the corresponding index in the list `w`. If `q[j]` is greater than 0, then `eta` contains `j`. If `q[j]` is not greater than 0, then `eta` remains an empty list.
