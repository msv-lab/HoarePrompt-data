Output State: **`eta` is a list containing `n`, `j` is `n`, and `n` must be at least 1.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `j` (which is equal to `n`) to the list `eta`. Since `j` is initially equal to `n`, `eta` now contains the value `n`. The conditions and values of other variables remain unchanged.
