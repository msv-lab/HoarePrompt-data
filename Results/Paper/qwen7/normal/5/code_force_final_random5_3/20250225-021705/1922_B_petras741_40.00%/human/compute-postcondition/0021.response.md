Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = n`. The loop will continue as long as `j < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `eta` is an empty list.
   - `j` is `n-1`.
   - `n` must be at least 1.
   - If `q[j]` is greater than 0, then `eta` is updated to include `j`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `j` is currently `n-1`, the next value of `j` would be `n-1 + 1 = n`.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must remain the same or increase (but it cannot decrease since it must be at least 1).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` will be incremented to `n`.
   - `eta` remains unchanged because the condition `q[j] > 0` is not met (since `j` is already `n-1` and the loop will stop if `j` equals `n`).

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`eta` is an empty list, `j` is `n`, `n` must be at least 1**.
