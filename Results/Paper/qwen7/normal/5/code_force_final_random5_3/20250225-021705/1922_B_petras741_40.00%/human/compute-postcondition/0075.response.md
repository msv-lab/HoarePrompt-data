Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `j < n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` remains the same
   - `i` remains the same
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `w` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces
   - `q` is a list of `n+1` elements where each element is 0 except for the element at index `w[j]` which is incremented by 1
   - `j` is `j_end + 1`

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` is `j_end + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1 to become `j_end + 2`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Final State for the Next Iteration**:
   - `t` remains the same
   - `i` remains the same
   - `n` must be greater than 0 (unchanged)
   - `w` remains the same
   - `q` remains the same (since the increment happens inside the loop, it will be updated during the execution of the loop body)
   - `j` becomes `j_end + 2`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`t` remains the same, `i` remains the same, `n` must be greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers from the input split by spaces, `q` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is 0 except for the element at index `w[j]` which is incremented by 1, `j` is `j_end + 2`**.
