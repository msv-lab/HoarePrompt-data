Output State: `eta` contains at least three elements, `eta_ln` is equal to the length of `eta`, `rho` is the sum of all elements in `eta`, and `res` is the sum of the following terms for each element `q[eta[j]]` in `eta` where `j` ranges from 0 to `eta_ln-1`:

1. `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6`
2. `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`

The loop breaks when `j` exceeds 1000, so the exact number of iterations is limited to 1000, and `res` is updated accordingly for each element in `eta` up to the 1000th iteration.
