You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

    #State: All iterations of the loop have been executed. The variable `i` will have a value of `t-1` since it increments by 1 in each iteration of the loop. For each `i` from 0 to `t-1`, the following conditions hold: `n` is an integer input by the user, `w` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `eta` is a list of unique integers from `w` that have a count greater than 0 in `q`, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, `rho` is the sum of `q[eta[j]]` for all `j` in `eta`, and `res` accumulates the contributions from each iteration of the loop as described. If `n` is less than 3, `res` is simply 0.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Specifically, it does not account for the condition that the chosen sticks must be able to form a non-degenerate triangle. The program simply calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks without checking if they can form a triangle.

To illustrate this, consider the following input:

```
3
3
1 1 1
3
2 2 2
3
1 2 3
```

- For the first test case, the program will output `3` because it calculates the combinations of choosing 3 sticks out of 3, which is `3 * 2 * 1 / 6 = 1`, but it should output `3` since any combination of the three sticks can form a triangle.
- For the second test case, the program will output `3` because it calculates the combinations of choosing 3 sticks out of 3, which is `3 * 2 * 1 / 6 = 1`, but it should output `3` since any combination of the three sticks can form a triangle.
- For the third test case, the program will output `0` because it does not check the triangle inequality condition, but it should output `0` since no combination of the sticks can form a triangle.

The program needs to check if the chosen sticks satisfy the triangle inequality conditions (i.e., the sum of the lengths of any two sticks must be greater than the length of the third stick).
