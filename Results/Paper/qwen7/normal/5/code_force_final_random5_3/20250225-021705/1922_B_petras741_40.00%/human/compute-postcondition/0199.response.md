Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` representing the number of sub-cases, followed by an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, it calculates a specific combinatorial result based on the frequency of unique integers in the list `a`. If `n` is less than 3, it returns 0. The function prints the calculated result for each valid sub-case and does not return any value explicitly.**
