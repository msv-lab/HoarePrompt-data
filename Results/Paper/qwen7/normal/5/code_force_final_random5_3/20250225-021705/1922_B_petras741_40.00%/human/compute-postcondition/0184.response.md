Output State: **`j` is greater than 1002, `eta_ln` must be greater than 1001, `res` is increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`**.

Explanation: The initial state includes `j` being greater than 1002, `eta_ln` being greater than 1001, and `res` being increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6`. The code then adds `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` to `res`. Since the values of `q`, `eta`, and `rho` are not specified, they remain as expressions involving these variables. The conditions on `j` and `eta_ln` remain unchanged.
