Output State: **`t` remains the same, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an integer input by the user, `w` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code takes an input from the user, splits it into a list of strings based on spaces, and then converts each string in the list to an integer. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged, `n` is still an integer input by the user, and `w` is updated to be a list of integers derived from the input.
