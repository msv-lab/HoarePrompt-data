Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `list2` contains the integer value of the element at index 4 from `list1`.**

Explanation: The code appends to `list2` the integer value of the element at index `2 * i` from `list1`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `2 * i` equals 2. After executing the code, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, `list2` now contains the integer value of the element at index 4 from `list1`.
