Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `numbers` is 0, `int(a)` is the value of `a`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `list2` is an empty list, `list1` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code `a = input()` reads a string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `a`. The initial values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `out` remains an empty list, `numbers` remains 0, `int(a)` is the integer value of the input string `a`, `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 5000, `list2` remains an empty list, and `list1` remains an empty list.
