Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `numbers` is 0, `int(num)` is the value of `num`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `list2` is an empty list, `list1` is an empty list.**

The code initializes `list1` as an empty list. This does not affect the values of the other variables (`out`, `numbers`, `int(num)`, `t`, and `list2`). Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
