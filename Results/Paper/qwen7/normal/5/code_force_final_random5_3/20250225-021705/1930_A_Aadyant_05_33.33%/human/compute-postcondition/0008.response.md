Output State: **`out` is an empty list, `numbers` is 0, `a` is `int(a)`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `list2` is an empty list, `list1` is equal to the list of strings obtained by splitting the input string `b`.**

Explanation: The code `list1 = b.split()` splits the input string `b` into a list of substrings based on whitespace and assigns it to `list1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
