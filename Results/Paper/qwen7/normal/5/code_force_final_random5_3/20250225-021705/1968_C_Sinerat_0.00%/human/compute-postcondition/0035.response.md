Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1, `a[i]` is equal to `a[0] + x[0]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `a[i]` to be the sum of `a[i - 1]` and `x[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `a[i - 1]` refers to `a[0]` and `x[i - 1]` refers to `x[0]`. Since no specific values for `a[0]` and `x[0]` are provided, the updated value of `a[i]` (which is `a[1]`) is the sum of `a[0]` and `x[0]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
