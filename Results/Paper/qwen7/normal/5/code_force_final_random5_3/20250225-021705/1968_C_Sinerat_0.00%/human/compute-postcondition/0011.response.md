Output State: `n` must be greater than 1; `a[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1` will be the cumulative sum of `x` from index 0 to `i-1`, starting with `a[0]` as 500.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` will contain `n` elements where each element `a[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`) will hold the sum of the first `i` elements of the list `x`, plus the initial value of 500 for `a[0]`. The variable `n` must remain greater than 1, and `x` will retain its original values as it was not modified within the loop.
