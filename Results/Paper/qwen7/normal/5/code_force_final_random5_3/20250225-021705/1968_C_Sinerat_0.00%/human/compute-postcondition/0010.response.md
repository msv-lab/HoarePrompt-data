Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `i` is `a[i] + x[i] + 1`; `a[i]` is now `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`**

Explanation: The code `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]` updates the value of `a[i]` to be equal to the previous value of `a[i - 1]` plus the previous value of `x[i - 1]`. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
