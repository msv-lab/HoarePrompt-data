Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n`, where `n` is an integer greater than 2.
- `a[i]` is equal to `a[n-2] + x[n-2]`.
- All elements in `a` from index 0 to `n-1` are computed as follows:
  - `a[0] = 500`
  - Each subsequent element `a[i]` is the sum of the previous element `a[i-1]` and the corresponding element `x[i-1]` from the user-input list `x`.

Let's break down the computation of the list `a`:

1. Initialize `a[0] = 500`.
2. For each subsequent element `a[i]` (where `i` ranges from 1 to `n-1`):
   - `a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.

Given that `i` is equal to `n`, the loop has completed all its iterations, and the list `a` will contain the cumulative sums starting from 500 up to the sum of the first `n` elements of the list `x`.

Therefore, the list `a` will look like this:
- `a[0] = 500`
- `a[1] = 500 + x[0]`
- `a[2] = 500 + x[0] + x[1]`
- ...
- `a[n-1] = 500 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-2]`

Since `a[i]` is `a[n-2] + x[n-2]`, it confirms that the last element `a[n-1]` is indeed the sum of the initial value 500 and the first `n-1` elements of the list `x`.

The print statement `print(*a)` will print the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

Output: **500 500+x[0] 500+x[0]+x[1] ... 500+x[0]+x[1]+...+x[n-2]**
