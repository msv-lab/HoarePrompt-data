Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially equal to `n`.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 1 minus 1 (which means `n` is at least 1).

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop `for i in range(1, n)` will execute as long as `1 <= i < n`. 

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initially equal to `n`, the loop will not execute because `i` is not within the range `1 <= i < n` when it starts.
   - To make the loop execute, `i` needs to be set to 1 (the starting point of the range) and `n` should remain as it is (at least 1).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` to 1 and `n` remains as it is (at least 1).

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 1**
