Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the condition `range(1, n)`. Therefore, the variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range `1` to `n-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was updated to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`.

3. **Determine the New Value of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, if `i` was previously `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`, then for the next iteration, `i` will be `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1] + 1`.

4. **Ensure the Loop Condition is Met**: For the loop to continue executing, `i` must still be less than `n`. Given that `n` must be greater than 1, the new value of `i` should still satisfy this condition.

5. **Update the State**: Based on the above points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `i` and the unchanged condition for `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `i` is `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1] + 1`**
