Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `x` of `n-1` integers. It then computes a list `a` of length `n` where `a[0]` is initialized to 500, and each subsequent element `a[i]` is the cumulative sum of 500 and the first `i+1` elements of `x`. Finally, it prints the list `a` for each test case.**
