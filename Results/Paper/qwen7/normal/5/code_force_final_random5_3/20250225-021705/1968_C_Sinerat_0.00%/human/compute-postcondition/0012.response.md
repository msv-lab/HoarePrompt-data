Output State: `n` must be greater than 1; `a[i]` for each index `i` from 0 to `n-1` is the sum of the first `i+1` elements of the list `x`, starting with `a[0] = 500`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` will contain `n` elements where each element `a[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is the cumulative sum of the first `i+1` elements of the list `x`. The first element `a[0]` is initialized to 500, and each subsequent element `a[i]` is calculated as `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.
