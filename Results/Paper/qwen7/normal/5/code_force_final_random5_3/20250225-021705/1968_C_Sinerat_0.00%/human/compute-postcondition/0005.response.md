Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range function arguments `1` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` equal to 1.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Adjust the state of `n`**: Since the loop requires `i` to be less than `n`, `n` must be greater than 1.

5. **Consider the other variables**: The variables `x` and `a` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` must be greater than 1**
