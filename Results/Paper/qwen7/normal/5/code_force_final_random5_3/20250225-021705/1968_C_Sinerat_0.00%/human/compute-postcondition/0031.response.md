Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1 minus 1, `a[1]` is `a[0] + x[0]`, `a[2]` is `a[1] + x[1]`, ..., `a[n-1]` is the sum of `a[n-2] + x[n-2]`, and `x` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `x`. The value of `n` is reduced by 1 because the new input integer is one less than before. All other variables and their relationships remain unchanged.
