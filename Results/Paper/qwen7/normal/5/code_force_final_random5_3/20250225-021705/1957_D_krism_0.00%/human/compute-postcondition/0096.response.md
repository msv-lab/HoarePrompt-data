Output State: **`i` is 1; `y` is `arr[0]`**

Explanation: The code `y = arr[i - 1]` assigns the value of `arr[i - 1]` to `y`. Given that `i` is 1, `i - 1` equals 0, so `y` is assigned the value of `arr[0]`. The initial value of `i` remains unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 is still valid.
