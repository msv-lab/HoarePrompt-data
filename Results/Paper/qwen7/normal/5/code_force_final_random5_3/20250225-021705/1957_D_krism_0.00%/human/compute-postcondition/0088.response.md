Output State: `i` is 30, `j` is 0, `cur` is the value of `prefix[30]`, for each `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` contains the total count of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `cur`, and `suf[j][0]` contains the total count of bits set to 0 in the same binary representation.

Explanation: After the loop completes all 32 iterations, `j` will be 0. The loop iterates over each bit position from 31 down to 0, incrementing the count of 1s (`suf[j][1]`) or 0s (`suf[j][0]`) in the binary representation of `cur` for the corresponding bit positions. Since it processes all 32 bits, `j` ends up being 0, and both `suf[j][1]` and `suf[j][0]` contain the total counts of 1s and 0s in the binary representation of `cur`.
