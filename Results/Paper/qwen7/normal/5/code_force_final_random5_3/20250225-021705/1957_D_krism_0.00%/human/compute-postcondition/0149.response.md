Output State: **`j` is 2, `c` is an integer, `pre[0][1]` is 2, `pre[2][0]` is 1, `suf[0][1]` is -1, `suf[j][0]` is -1**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][0] -= 1` decrements the value of `suf[j][0]` by 1. Given that `j` is 2, `suf[2][0]` is decremented by 1. Since `suf[0][1]` was -1 if `(c >> 1 & 1)` is true, and `suf[0][0]` is -1, these values remain unchanged. The value of `c` and `pre[0][1]` and `pre[2][0]` also remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `suf[2][0]` being -1.
