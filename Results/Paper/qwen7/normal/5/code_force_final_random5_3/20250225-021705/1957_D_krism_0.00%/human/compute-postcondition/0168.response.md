Postcondition: `ans` is increased by either `pre[4][0] * suf[4][0] + pre[4][1] * suf[4][1]` or `pre[4][0] * suf[4][1] + pre[4][1] * suf[4][0]`, depending on whether the `j`-th bit of `c` is set to 1. Specifically, if the `j`-th bit of `c` is 1, then `ans` is increased by `pre[4][0] * suf[4][0] + pre[4][1] * suf[4][1]` with `j` being 30, `pre[31][1]` being 32, and `suf[31][1]` being -32. If the `j`-th bit of `c` is 0, then `ans` is increased by `pre[4][0] * suf[4][1] + pre[4][1] * suf[4][0]` with `j` being 30, `pre[31][0]` being 2, `pre[31][1]` being 32, `suf[31][1]` being -32, and `k` being 4. `j` remains 31, `c` is `prefix[i]`, and `y` is `arr[i - 1]`.
