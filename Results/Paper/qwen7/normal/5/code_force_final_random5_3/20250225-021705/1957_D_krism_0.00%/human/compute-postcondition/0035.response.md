Output State: **`i` is 32, `j` is 0, `suf[j][1]` is 1**.

Explanation: The code `suf[j][1] += 1` increments the value at `suf[j][1]` by 1. Given the initial state where `j` is 0, and if the bit at position `j` in `i` is 1, then `suf[j][1]` is increased by 1. Since `i` is 32 (which in binary is `100000`), the bit at position 0 is 0. However, the condition for incrementing `suf[j][1]` is not met because the bit at position `j` (which is 0) is 0. Nevertheless, the code still executes and increments `suf[j][1]` by 1, making its value 1. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.
