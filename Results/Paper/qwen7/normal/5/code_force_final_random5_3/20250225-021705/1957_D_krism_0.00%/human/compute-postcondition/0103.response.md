Output State: **`j` is 0; `c` is an integer where shifting `c` right by `j` bits and performing bitwise AND with 1 results in a non-zero value; `pre[0][1]` is incremented by 1; `suf[0][1]` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet decrements the value of `suf[j][1]` by 1. Since `j` is 0, it specifically decrements `suf[0][1]` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
