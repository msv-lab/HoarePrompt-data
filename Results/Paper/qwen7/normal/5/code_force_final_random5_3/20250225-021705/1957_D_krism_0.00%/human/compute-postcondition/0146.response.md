Output State: **`j` is 2, `c` is an integer, `pre[0][1]` is 2, `pre[2][1]` is 1, `suf[0][1]` is -1 if `(c >> 1 & 1)` is true; otherwise, `suf[0][0]` is -1**

Explanation: The code `pre[j][1] += 1` increments the value of `pre[j][1]` by 1. Given that `j` is 2, the value of `pre[2][1]` is updated to 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
