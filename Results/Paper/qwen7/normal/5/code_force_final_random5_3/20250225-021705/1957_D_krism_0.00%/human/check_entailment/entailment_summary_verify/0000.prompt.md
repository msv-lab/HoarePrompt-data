You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the number of tuples (x,
y, z ) such that:

  * 1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n , and 
  * f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) . 

We define f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r} , where
\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the number of
described tuples.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    6 2 4
    
    1
    
    3
    
    5
    
    7 3 7 2 1

Output

    4
    0
    16
    
Note

In the first case, there are 4 such tuples in the array [6, 2, 4] :

  * (1 , 2 , 2 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2) = 4 \oplus 2 > (a_1 \oplus a_2) = 4 
  * (1 , 1 , 3 ): (a_1) \oplus (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 6 \oplus 0 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 2 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2 \oplus a_3) = 4 \oplus 6 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 3 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) \oplus (a_3) = 0 \oplus 4 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 

In the second test case, there are no such tuples.

- Program:
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    print('-----------------')
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix = [0]
    for v in arr:
        prefix.append(v ^ prefix[-1])
    print(arr, prefix)
    pre = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    suf = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    for i in range(32):
        pre[i][0] += 1
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        cur = prefix[i]
        for j in range(32):
            if cur >> j & 1:
                suf[j][1] += 1
            else:
                suf[j][0] += 1
    print(pre)
    print(suf)
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        y = arr[i - 1]
        k = y.bit_length() - 1
        ans += pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]
        c = prefix[i]
        for j in range(32):
            if c >> j & 1:
                pre[j][1] += 1
                suf[j][1] -= 1
            else:
                pre[j][0] += 1
                suf[j][0] -= 1
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( n \) and a list of integers \( a \). It computes the cumulative XOR of elements in the list \( a \) and then calculates a specific value based on the counts of 0s and 1s in certain bit positions. The function ultimately returns the computed value \( ans \).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, the program does not handle the XOR operation and the counting of valid tuples as described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect XOR Calculation**: The program calculates the prefix XOR values correctly but does not use them effectively to count the valid tuples. The `pre` and `suf` arrays are initialized incorrectly and are not used to count the valid tuples as required.

2. **Incorrect Tuple Counting Logic**: The logic to count the valid tuples `(x, y, z)` such that `f(x, y) ⊕ f(y, z) > f(x, z)` is not implemented. The current implementation does not check this condition and instead seems to be counting something else.

3. **Missing Key Steps**: The program lacks the necessary steps to compute the XOR values for different ranges and compare them according to the problem statement. It does not maintain a dynamic count of valid tuples as the indices change.

To fix this, the program needs to:
- Compute the prefix XOR values correctly.
- Use these prefix XOR values to efficiently count the valid tuples `(x, y, z)` that satisfy the given condition.

Since the provided code does not meet the requirements and does not handle the XOR operation and tuple counting as specified, the correctness is **False**.
