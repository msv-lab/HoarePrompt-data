Output State: **`i` is 32; `y` is `arr[31]`; `k` is 5; `ans` is `ans` + `pre[5][0] * suf[5][0] + pre[5][1] * suf[5][1]`**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is updated by adding the value of `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]` where `k` is 5. The values of `i`, `y`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
