Output State: **`j` is 31, `c` remains as an integer, `pre[31][1]` is 32, and `suf[31][1]` is -32, `y` is `arr[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `y = arr[i - 1]` assigns the value of `arr[i - 1]` to the variable `y`. However, since `arr` is not defined in the initial state and no specific value for `arr[i - 1]` is given, `y` simply holds the value of `arr[i - 1]`. All other variables (`j`, `c`, `pre[31][1]`, and `suf[31][1]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
