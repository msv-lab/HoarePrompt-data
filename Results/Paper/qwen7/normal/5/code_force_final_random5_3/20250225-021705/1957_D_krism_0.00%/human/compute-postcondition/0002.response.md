Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, the list a is updated to a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, and arr is a list of integers obtained from the input.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the standard input using `input().split()`, which splits the input into a list of strings. The `map(int, ...)` function then converts each string in the list to an integer. The resulting list of integers is assigned to the variable `arr`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state. The list `a` is updated to reflect the new list of integers obtained from the input.
