Output State: **`prefix` is [0, v ^ 0, v ^ (v ^ 0), v ^ (v ^ (v ^ 0))], `arr` must contain at least two elements, `v` is the second element in the list**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `v` XORed with the last element of `prefix` to `prefix`. Initially, `prefix` is `[0, v ^ 0, v ^ (v ^ 0)]`. Since `v ^ 0` is `v`, and `v ^ (v ^ 0)` simplifies to `v`, the last element of `prefix` before appending is `v`. Therefore, `prefix` becomes `[0, v ^ 0, v ^ (v ^ 0), v ^ (v ^ (v ^ 0))]`, which simplifies to `[0, v, v, v]`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
