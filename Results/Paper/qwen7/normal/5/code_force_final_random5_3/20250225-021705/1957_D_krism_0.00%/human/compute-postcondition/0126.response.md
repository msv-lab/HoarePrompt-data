Output State: **`i` is 32; `y` is `arr[31]`; `k` is 5**

Explanation: The code calculates the bit length of `y` using the `bit_length()` method and subtracts 1 from it. Since `y` is `arr[31]` and assuming `arr[31]` is a positive integer (as negative integers do not have a defined bit length in this context), the bit length of `arr[31]` would be the number of bits needed to represent `arr[31]` in binary form. If `arr[31]` is a value like 32, its binary representation is `100000`, which has 6 bits. Subtracting 1 from the bit length gives 5. Therefore, `k` is 5. The values of `i` and `y` remain unchanged.
