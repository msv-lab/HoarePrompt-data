Output State: The `prefix` list will contain the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr`. Specifically, if `arr` has `n` elements, `prefix` will be `[0, v_1 ^ 0, v_2 ^ (v_1 ^ 0), ..., v_n ^ (v_{n-1} ^ ... ^ v_1 ^ 0)]`, where `v_i` represents the i-th element in `arr`.

This means that each element in the `prefix` list (except the first one) is the result of XORing the current element in `arr` with all previous elements in `prefix` up to that point. The `prefix` list starts with 0 and continues to build upon itself based on the XOR operation with each new element from `arr`.
