Postcondition: **`i` is 30, `j` is 32, `cur` is the value of `prefix[30]`, for each `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` contains the count of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `cur` from position `j` to 31 plus 1, and `suf[j][0]` contains the count of bits set to 0 in the same range.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition `cur >> j & 1` is true or false, the values of `suf[j][1]` and `suf[j][0]` remain unchanged as they both contain the count of bits set to 1 and 0, respectively, in the specified range of `cur`'s binary representation from position `j` to 31.
