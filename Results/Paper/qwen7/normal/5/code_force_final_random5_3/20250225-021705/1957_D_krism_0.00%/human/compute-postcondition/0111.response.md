Output State: **`j` is 1, `c` is an integer, `pre[0][1]` is unchanged, `suf[0][1]` is unchanged, `pre[1][0]` is 1, and `suf[1][0]` is 0; `suf[1][1]` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `suf[j][1]` is updated by decrementing its value by 1. Given that `j` is 1, the affected element is `suf[1][1]`. Initially, `suf[1][1]` was incremented by 1 in the previous state, making it 1 (assuming it was 0 before). After executing `suf[j][1] -= 1`, the value of `suf[1][1]` becomes 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
