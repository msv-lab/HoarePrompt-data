Postcondition: **`ans` is increased by either `pre[4][0] * suf[4][0] + pre[4][1] * suf[4][1]` or `pre[4][0] * suf[4][1] + pre[4][1] * suf[4][0]`, depending on whether the `j`-th bit of `c` is set to 1 (with `j` being 31, `c` is `prefix[i]`, and `y` is `arr[i - 1]`); `pre[4][1]` is increased by 1, `suf[31][1]` is decreased by 1, and `k` remains 4 if the `j`-th bit is 1. If the `j`-th bit is 0, `ans` is increased by either `2 * suf[4][0] + pre[4][1] * suf[4][1]` or `2 * suf[4][1] + pre[4][1] * suf[4][0]`, `suf[4][0]` is decreased by 1, `pre[4][0]` is set to 2, and `suf[4][1]` remains unchanged, while `k` remains 4. `j` is 30, `c` is `prefix[i]`, and `y` is `arr[i - 1]` in both cases.**
