Output State: **`i` is 1; `y` is `arr[0]`; `k` is `y.bit_length() - 1`**

Explanation: The code calculates the bit length of `y` (which is `arr[0]`), subtracts 1 from it, and assigns the result to `k`. Since the exact value of `arr[0]` is not provided, `k` is expressed in terms of `y.bit_length() - 1`. The values of `i` and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
