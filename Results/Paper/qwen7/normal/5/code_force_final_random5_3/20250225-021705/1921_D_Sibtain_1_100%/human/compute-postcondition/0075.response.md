The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` was 1, so now `i` is 2. The other variables (`j`, `ans`, `t1`, `t2`, and `k`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `ans` is `ans + max(abs(a[1] - c[1]), t2)`, `t1` is `abs(a[1] - c[1])`, `t2` is `abs(a[-1] - c[-1])`, `k` is 2.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 2, `ans` is `ans + max(abs(a[1] - c[1]), t2)`, `t1` is `abs(a[1] - c[1])`, `t2` is `abs(a[-1] - c[-1])`, `k` is 2**
