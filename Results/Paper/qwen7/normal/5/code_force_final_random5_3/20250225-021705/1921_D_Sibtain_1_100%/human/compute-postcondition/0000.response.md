Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input value that determines the number of iterations of the loop.

2. **Determine the initial state**: We know that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\). This means that the input value (which we'll call `num_tests`) should be within this range for the loop to execute.

3. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop depends on the input value, we need to ensure that the input value is within the specified range. The initial state before the loop starts is that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. Therefore, the input value (`num_tests`) must be one of these values.

4. **Formulate the final state**: The state before the loop starts is that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\). For the loop to execute, the input value must be within this range.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value, which will determine the number of iterations of the loop.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and the input value must be one of these values**
