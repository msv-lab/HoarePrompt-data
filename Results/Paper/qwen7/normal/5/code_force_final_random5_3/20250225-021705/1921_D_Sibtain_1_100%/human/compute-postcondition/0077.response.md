Postcondition: `i`, `j`, `ans`, `t1`, `t2`, and `k` retain their original values (i.e., `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `ans` is `ans + max(abs(a[1] - c[1]), t2)`, `t1` is `abs(a[1] - c[1])`, `t2` is `abs(a[-1] - c[-1])`, `k` is 2). If `t2 > t1`, then `i` becomes 1 and `j` becomes 3. Otherwise, `i` remains 2 and `j` remains 2.
