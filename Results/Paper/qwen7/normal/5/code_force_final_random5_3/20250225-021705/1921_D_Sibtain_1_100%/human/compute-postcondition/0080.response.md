Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 2, `ans` is `ans + max(abs(a[1] - c[1]), t2) + max(t1, t2)`, `t1` is `abs(a[1] - c[1])`, `t2` is `abs(a[-1] - c[-1])`, `k` is 3, `t1` is updated to `abs(a[1] - c[1])`**.

Explanation: The code updates `t1` to the value of `abs(a[i] - c[i])`. Given that `i` is 1, `t1` is now `abs(a[1] - c[1])`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
