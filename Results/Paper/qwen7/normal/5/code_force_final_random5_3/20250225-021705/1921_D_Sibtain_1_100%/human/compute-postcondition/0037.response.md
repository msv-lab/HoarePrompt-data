Output State: **`k` is 1, `len(a)` is 1, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `c[0]`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `t2` as the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`. Given that `len(a)` is 1, both `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]` simplify to `a[0]` and `c[0]` respectively, assuming `j` is 0 (which is typical when no value for `j` is specified). Therefore, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `c[0]`. The values of `k`, `len(a)`, and `t1` remain unchanged from their initial states.
