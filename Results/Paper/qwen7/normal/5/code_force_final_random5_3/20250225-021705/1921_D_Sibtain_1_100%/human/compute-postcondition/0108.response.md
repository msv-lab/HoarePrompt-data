Output State: **`k` is 0, `t1` is abs(a[i] - c[i]), `t2` is abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j]) - 1, `j` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `j` is incremented by 1. Since `t2` was initially greater than `t1`, and `t2` is defined as `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])`, after incrementing `j` by 1, the new value of `t2` will be `abs(a[len(a) - (j+1)] - c[len(c) - (j+1)])`, which is `abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j]) - 1` assuming `a` and `c` are lists and the absolute difference decreases by 1 due to the decrement in indices. All other variables remain unchanged.
