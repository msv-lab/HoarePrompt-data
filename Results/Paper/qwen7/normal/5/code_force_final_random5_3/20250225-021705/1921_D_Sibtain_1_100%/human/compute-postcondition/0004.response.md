Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. All elements in `a` and `c` are the same, and there is only one unique element in both lists.**
