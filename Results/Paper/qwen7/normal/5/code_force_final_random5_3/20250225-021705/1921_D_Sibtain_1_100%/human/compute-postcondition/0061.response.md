Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 1, `ans` is 0, `t1` is abs(`a[0]` - `c[0]`).**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between the elements at index `i` of lists `a` and `c`. Since `i` is 0, `t1` is set to `abs(a[0] - c[0])`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
