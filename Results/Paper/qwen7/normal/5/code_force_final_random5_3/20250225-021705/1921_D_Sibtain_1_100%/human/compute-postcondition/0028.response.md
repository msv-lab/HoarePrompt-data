Output State: **`k` is 1, `len(a)` is 1, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, `ans` is `max(abs(a[i] - c[i]), t2)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `t1` to `abs(a[i] - c[i])`. The initial values of `k`, `len(a)`, and `t1` are preserved. The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum of the new `t1` and `t2`. Since `t2` was not updated, it remains unchanged.
