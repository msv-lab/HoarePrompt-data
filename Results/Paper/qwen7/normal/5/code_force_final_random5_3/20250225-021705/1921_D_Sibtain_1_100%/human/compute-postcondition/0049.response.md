Output State: **`n` is decremented by 1, `m` is an input integer, `k` is equal to the length of list `a`, `len(a)` is the number of integers entered, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `c[0]`, `ans` is the sum of all `max(t1, t2)` values calculated during each iteration of the loop, `i` and `j` are both equal to the length of list `a`, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `c` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `c = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and converts them into a list of integers. This list is assigned to the variable `c`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `n` is decremented by 1, and `c` now holds the list of integers entered.
