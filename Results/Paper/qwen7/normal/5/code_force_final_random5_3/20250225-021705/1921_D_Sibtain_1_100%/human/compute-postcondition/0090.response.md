Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - We know that the loop has executed up to the third iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `ans` is the sum of `max(t1, t2)` for each iteration from 1 to the length of list `a`.

2. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop head does not explicitly show the variables `i`, `j`, or `ans`. However, we can infer that these variables are part of the loop context since they are mentioned in the problem description.

3. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is based on the input value, which is read using `int(input())`.
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more iterations left to process.

4. **Current Iteration State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `ans` is the sum of `max(t1, t2)` for each iteration from 1 to the length of list `a`.

5. **Next Iteration State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the loop must still have iterations left to process.
   - Since `i` is 1 and `j` is 2, the loop will continue to increment `j` until `j` equals the length of `a`.
   - `i` will remain 1 because it has already reached its initial value and cannot be incremented further without exceeding the length of `a`.

6. **Updating States:**
   - `i` will remain 1.
   - `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will become 3.
   - `ans` will be updated with the sum of `max(t1, t2)` for the current iteration (which is the fourth iteration).

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 3, `ans` is the sum of `max(t1, t2)` for each iteration from 1 to the length of list `a` plus the max value for the current iteration (which is the fourth iteration).**
