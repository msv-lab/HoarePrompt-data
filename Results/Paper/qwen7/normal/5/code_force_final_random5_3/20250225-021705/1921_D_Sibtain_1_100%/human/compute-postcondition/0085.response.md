Postcondition: `i`, `j`, `ans`, `t1`, `t2`, and `k` retain their initial values. If `t2 > t1`, then `i` becomes 1 and `j` becomes 3. Otherwise, `i` remains 1 and `j` remains 2. The value of `ans` is updated to `ans + max(abs(a[1] - c[1]), t2) + max(t1, t2)`, `t1` is `abs(a[1] - c[1])`, `t2` is `abs(a[2] - c[2])`, and `k` remains 3.
