Output State: **`k` is 1, `len(a)` is 1, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `c[0]`, `j` is increased by 1.**

The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Since `j` was not previously defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be 0 before this operation. After the operation, `j` becomes 1. All other variables (`k`, `len(a)`, `t1`, `t2`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
