Reasoning:

1. The function correctly handles the input format and initializes variables.
2. It checks if both lists `a` and `c` contain the same value across all elements. If they do, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case, which is correct according to the problem statement.
3. The sorting of `a` in ascending order and `c` in descending order ensures that the largest possible differences are considered first.
4. The logic for calculating the cumulative sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of the sorted lists `a` and `c` is correct. By starting with the smallest element of `a` and the largest element of `c`, and vice versa, the algorithm maximizes the differences.
5. The loop iterates through the elements of `a` and `c`, updating the indices `i` and `j` appropriately to ensure the maximum difference is always considered.
6. The final result is printed correctly after processing each test case.

Given the above points, the function appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
