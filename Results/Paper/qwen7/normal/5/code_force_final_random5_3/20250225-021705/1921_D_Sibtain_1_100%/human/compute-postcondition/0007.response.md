Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `c` is a list of integers obtained from the input using `map(int, input().split())`, and if the condition `len(set(a)) == 1 and len(set(c)) == 1 and (a[0] == c[0])` is true, we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
