Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with only one element, `c` is a list of integers sorted in descending order. The length of `a` is 1, and we continue the loop or statement we were inside.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it merely moves the control flow to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement after the current block. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `c` remain unchanged, and the program continues with the next iteration of the loop or the next statement.
