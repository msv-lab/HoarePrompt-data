Output State: **`P` is 0, `M` is the total number of '-' or any other character in the string `e`, `i` is equal to the input value `N`, `N` is replaced by the integer input, `s` is an integer input, and `e` is the string input.**

Explanation: The line `P = 0` initializes the variable `P` to 0. This does not affect the values of `M`, `i`, `N`, `s`, or `e`. Therefore, the updated state includes `P` being set to 0 while the other variables retain their initial conditions.
