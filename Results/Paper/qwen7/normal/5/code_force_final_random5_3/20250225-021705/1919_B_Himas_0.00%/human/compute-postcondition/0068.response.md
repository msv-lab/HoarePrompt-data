Output State: **`e` is a string with at least two characters, `q` is the second character in the string, `P` is 2 if `q` is '+', and `M` is 3 if `q` is not '+'**.

Explanation: The value of `M` is incremented by 1, so if `q` was not '+', making `M` equal to 2 before the increment, now `M` is 3. If `q` was '+', making `M` equal to 2 before the increment, `M` remains 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
