Output State: **`e` is a non-empty string, `q` is the next character in the string `e`, `P` is 2, `M` is 2**

Explanation: Initially, `P` is set to 2 if `q` equals '+', and `M` is set to 1 if `q` equals '+', otherwise `M` is incremented by 1. After executing `P += 1`, `P` is incremented by 1, making it 2 (since it was initially 2). Since `M` was already 1 if `q` equals '+', it remains unchanged, but if `q` did not equal '+', it would have been incremented to 2. In both cases, `M` ends up being 2. The values of `e` and `q` remain unchanged.
