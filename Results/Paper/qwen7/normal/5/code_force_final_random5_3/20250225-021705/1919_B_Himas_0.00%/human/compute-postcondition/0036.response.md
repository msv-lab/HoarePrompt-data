Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `q` which iterates over each character in the string `e`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the string `e` to iterate over.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `e` is a non-empty string.
   - If `q` was '+' in the previous iteration, then `P` is 1.
   - If `q` was not '+' in the previous iteration, then `M` is 1.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each character in `e`, at the start of the next iteration, `q` will be the next character in the string `e`.
   - Therefore, `e` will be the same string, but it will be one character shorter because the previous iteration has already processed one character.
   - The condition for `P` or `M` being set (based on the previous value of `q`) remains unchanged unless the current `q` changes.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `e` will remain the same string but will be one character shorter.
   - `q` will be the next character in the string `e`.
   - `P` will remain 1 if the previous `q` was '+'.
   - `M` will remain 1 if the previous `q` was not '+'.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`e` is a non-empty string (one character shorter than before), `q` is the next character in the string `e`, `P` is 1 if the previous `q` was '+', otherwise `M` is 1.**
