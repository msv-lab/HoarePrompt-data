Output State: **`P` is the total number of '+' characters in the string `e`, `M` is the total number of '-' or any other character in the string `e`, `i` is equal to the input value `N`, and `N` is replaced by the integer input, `s` is an integer input.**

The code `s = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it into an integer, assigning it to the variable `s`. The values of `P`, `M`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. The variable `N` is also updated to the value of `s`.
