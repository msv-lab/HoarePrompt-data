Output State: **`i` is 3, `sum_value_digits` is 6, `values[1]` is equal to `values[0] + 6`**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `i` is 3, `sum_value_digits` is 6, and `values[1]` is equal to `values[0] + 0`.
- The code updates `values[i]` to `values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits`. Since `i` is 3, `i - 1` is 2, and `sum_value_digits` is 6. Therefore, `values[3]` is updated to `values[2] + 6`.
- Since `values[1]` was initially equal to `values[0] + 0`, and no other changes were made to `values[0]` or `values[2]`, the only thing that changes is the relationship for `values[3]`. Thus, `values[3]` is now equal to `values[2] + 6`, which simplifies to `values[1] + 6` given the initial condition.
