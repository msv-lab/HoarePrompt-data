Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The final state of the `values` list will be such that each index `i` from 1 to 200000 will hold the sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i`. In other words, `values[i]` will store the cumulative sum of the digit sums of all integers from 1 to `i`.

To explain further, for each integer `i` from 1 to 200000, the loop calculates the sum of its digits (`sum_value_digits`) and updates `values[i]` to be the previous value of `values[i-1]` plus `sum_value_digits`. This process continues until the loop has iterated through all possible values up to 200000. Thus, `values[i]` accumulates the total sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i` for every `i` in the range from 1 to 200000.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    value = int(input())
    print(values[value])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 200000, `values` is an empty list or initialized to a list of zeros, `value` is an input integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is 199999, `values` is an empty list or initialized to a list of zeros, `value` is an input integer

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 199998, `values` is an empty list or initialized to a list of zeros, `value` is an input integer




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
