Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly solve the problem as described. The issue lies in the way the prefix sums (`values`) are being calculated and used. Specifically, the `values` array is initialized with a size of `2 * 10^5 + 1`, but it should only cover up to `n` since `n` is the largest number provided in the test cases. Additionally, the logic for calculating the prefix sums is flawed because it starts from 1 and goes up to `inf`, which is unnecessary and incorrect.

To fix this, the program should dynamically calculate the sum of the digits for each number up to `n` for each test case instead of precomputing and storing all possible sums up to `2 * 10^5`. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    queries = int(data[0])
    n_values = []
    for i in range(1, queries * 2 + 1, 2):
        n_values.append(int(data[i]))
    
    results = []
    for n in n_values:
        total_sum = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            digit_sum = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(i))
            total_sum += digit_sum
        results.append(total_sum)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

func_1()
```

This corrected version reads the input properly, processes each test case individually, and calculates the required sum of the digits for each number up to `n` without the need for precomputed values.
