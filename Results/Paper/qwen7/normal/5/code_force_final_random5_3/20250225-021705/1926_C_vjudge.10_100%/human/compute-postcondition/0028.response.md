Output State: **`i` is 1, `sum_value_digits` is 0, `values[1]` is equal to `values[0] + 0`, `sum_value_digits` is 0**

Explanation: The code `sum_value_digits += int(x)` increments `sum_value_digits` by the integer value of `x`. However, since the value of `x` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact new value of `sum_value_digits`. Given the initial state, `sum_value_digits` was 0, and it remains unchanged without a specific value for `x`. The other variables (`i` and `values[1]`) remain unaffected by this line of code.
