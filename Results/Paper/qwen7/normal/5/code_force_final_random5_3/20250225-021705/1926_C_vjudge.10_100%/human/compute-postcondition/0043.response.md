Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is set to 199999.
- `values` is an empty list or initialized to a list of zeros.
- `value` is an input integer.

The print statement is `print(values[value])`.

Since `values` is either an empty list or a list of zeros, and `value` is an input integer, the value of `values[value]` depends on the value of `value` itself.

If `value` is out of the bounds of the `values` list (which would be the case if `value` is negative or greater than or equal to the length of `values`), accessing `values[value]` would result in an `IndexError`. However, since `values` is either empty or contains zeros, `value` must be within the bounds of the list for the print statement to execute without error.

Given that `values` is either an empty list or a list of zeros, `values[value]` will be `0` if `value` is within the bounds of the list (i.e., `0 <= value < len(values)`).

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **0**
