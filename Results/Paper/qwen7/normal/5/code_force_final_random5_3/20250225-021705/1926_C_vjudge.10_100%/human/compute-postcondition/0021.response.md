Output State: **`i` must be a non-empty string with one less character; `sum_value_digits` is the sum of digits of `i` (converted to integers) plus the integer value of `x` + 1.**

Explanation: The code `sum_value_digits += int(x)` increments `sum_value_digits` by the integer value of `x`. Since the initial state of `sum_value_digits` is the sum of digits of `i` (converted to integers) plus the integer value of `x`, after executing the code, `sum_value_digits` becomes the sum of digits of `i` (converted to integers) plus the integer value of `x` plus 1. The variable `i` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
