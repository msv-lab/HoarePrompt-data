Output State: **`t` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 * 10^5; `inf` is 200001**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. The value of `n` and `inf` remain unchanged from their initial state.
