Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `qi` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `ans` is `m // a + m // b + 2`**.

This means that the variable `ans` is calculated as the integer division of `m` by `a`, plus the integer division of `m` by `b`, plus 2. The values of `t`, `qi`, `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
