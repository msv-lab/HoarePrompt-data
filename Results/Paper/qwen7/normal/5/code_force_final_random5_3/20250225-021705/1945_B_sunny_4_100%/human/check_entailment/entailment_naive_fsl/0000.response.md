Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. According to the problem description, the formula used in the program `ans = m // a + m // b + 2` is incorrect. This formula assumes that each installation will launch fireworks at the exact moment they become visible, which is not necessarily true.

To illustrate, consider the following example:

- Input: `a = 6`, `b = 7`, `m = 4`
- Expected Output: `2`

However, using the provided formula:
- `A = m // a + 1 = 4 // 6 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`
- `B = m // b + 1 = 4 // 7 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`
- `ans = A + B = 1 + 1 = 2`

This seems correct, but let's consider the timing more carefully:
- First installation launches at 6, 12, 18, etc.
- Second installation launches at 7, 14, 21, etc.
- Both installations will launch fireworks at 42 (LCM of 6 and 7), making them visible from 42 to 46.

At 42 minutes, both installations will launch fireworks simultaneously, making it possible to see 2 fireworks at the same time. However, the program does not account for the fact that the first installation might launch a firework just before the second installation, or vice versa, leading to a higher number of simultaneous visible fireworks.

For instance, if we consider the case where `a = 3`, `b = 4`, and `m = 10`:
- Expected Output: `7`
- Using the provided formula:
  - `A = m // a + 1 = 10 // 3 + 1 = 4`
  - `B = m // b + 1 = 10 // 4 + 1 = 3`
  - `ans = A + B = 4 + 3 = 7`

But the actual calculation should consider the overlap:
- First installation launches at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, etc.
- Second installation launches at 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, etc.
- Overlapping launches at 12, 24, etc., can result in up to 7 fireworks being visible simultaneously.

Thus, the provided program does not correctly handle all edge cases and should be considered incorrect.
