Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `qi` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code splits the input into three integers and assigns them to `a`, `b`, and `m`. The initial state of `t` and `qi` remains unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, and `qi` is still 0. The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are the integers obtained from the input.
