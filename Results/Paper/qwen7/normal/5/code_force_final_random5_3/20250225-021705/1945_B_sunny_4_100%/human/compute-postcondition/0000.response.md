Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each test case, a, b, and m are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^{18}; A is calculated as int(m/a)+1, B is calculated as int(m/b)+1, and A+B is printed for each test case.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`. It then calculates `A` as `int(m/a)+1` and `B` as `int(m/b)+1`, and prints the sum `A+B`. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` are updated for each test case, and `A` and `B` are recalculated accordingly. However, the initial conditions for `t` and the ranges for `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged after the code execution.
