Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer, and `a`, a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < `n`. It returns a string consisting of repeated sequences of the alphabet followed by the first three characters of the list `a` converted to their corresponding ASCII characters.**
