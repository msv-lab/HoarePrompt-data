Output State: **`i` is 26, `j` is 2, `n` is 26, `s` is 'bab...zAbbCdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzaaaabbbbccccdddd....zzzzbzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `char_count[2]` is 27, `char_count[3]` is 32**

Explanation: The value of `char_count[j]` is incremented by 1. Initially, `j` is 1 and `char_count[1]` is 27. After executing `char_count[j] += 1`, `j` is updated to 2, and `char_count[2]` becomes 27 + 1, which is 28. However, since the index in `char_count` starts from 0, `char_count[3]` is actually the one that gets incremented, making it 31 + 1, which is 32. All other variables remain unchanged.
