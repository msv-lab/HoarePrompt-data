The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer, and `a`, a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` < `n`. It returns a string consisting of repeated sequences of the alphabet, where each character in the alphabet appears a number of times specified by the corresponding integer in the list `a`. If the integer in `a` is `0`, the corresponding character in the alphabet is not included in the output string. The function also includes the first three characters of the list `a` converted to their corresponding ASCII characters at the end of the string.
