Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 1, `n` is 26, `s` is 'bab...zA', `char_count[2]` is equal to 27, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified in the given code, the `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply indicates that the execution would exit the current loop or conditional block if one existed. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
