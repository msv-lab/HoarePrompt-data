Output State: **`i` is 0; `j` is 2; `n` is a positive integer; `s` is 'ba'; `char_count[1]` is equal to 1**

Explanation: The code `s += chr(j + ord('a'))` appends a character to the string `s`. Here, `j` is 2, and `ord('a')` returns the ASCII value of 'a', which is 97. Adding 2 to 97 gives 99, which is the ASCII value of 'c'. Therefore, `chr(99)` results in the character 'c'. So, `s` changes from 'b' to 'ba'. The values of `i`, `j`, `n`, and `char_count[1]` remain unchanged.
