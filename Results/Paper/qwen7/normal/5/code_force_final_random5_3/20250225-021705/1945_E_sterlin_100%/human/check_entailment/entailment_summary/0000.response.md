Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires rearranging a permutation using at most 2 swaps to ensure that the number `x` is at the position `l` after performing a binary search. The provided code attempts to achieve this by identifying the correct positions for `x` and making necessary swaps.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1()**: Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - **func_2()**: Reads and returns the values of `n` and `x` for a single test case.
   - **func_3()**: Reads and returns the permutation `p` for a single test case.
   - **func_4()**: Reads input from the user (not used in the provided code).
   - **func_5()**: Reads input from the user and splits it into a list of strings (not used in the provided code).

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic is implemented within the loop that iterates over each test case.
   - It calculates the middle index `mid` and checks if `p[mid]` is less than or equal to `x`.
   - If `p[left]` equals `x`, it prints `0` indicating no swaps are needed.
   - If `x` is not found at `left`, it checks if `x` is not already in the seen positions.
   - If `x` is not in the seen positions, it performs one swap to bring `x` to the correct position.
   - If `x` is still not found, it performs two swaps to ensure `x` is at the correct position.

4. **Verification**:
   - The logic correctly identifies the positions of `x` and makes the necessary swaps.
   - The code handles all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement.
   - The constraints and conditions are properly checked and handled.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
