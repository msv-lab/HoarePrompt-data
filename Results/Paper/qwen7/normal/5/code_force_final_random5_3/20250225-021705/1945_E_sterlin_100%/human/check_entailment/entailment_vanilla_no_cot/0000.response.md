Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, it does not contain any function that performs the necessary operations to rearrange the permutation so that `p_l` equals `x` using at most 2 swaps. Instead, it defines placeholder functions for reading input, which are not used to solve the problem.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should include logic to find the correct positions for the elements and perform at most 2 swaps to ensure that the element `x` is at the start of the permutation when the binary search is applied. The current program does not contain this logic, hence it is incorrect.
