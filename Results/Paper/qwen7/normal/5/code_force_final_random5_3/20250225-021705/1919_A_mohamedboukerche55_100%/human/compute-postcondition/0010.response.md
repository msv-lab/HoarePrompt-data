Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is an input string, `a` is the first integer from the split string `s`, `b` is the second integer from the split string `s`. The overall postcondition states that either the sum of `a` and `b` is even, or the sum of `a` and `b` is odd, depending on the outcome of the if condition.
