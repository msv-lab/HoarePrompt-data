Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is equal to t-1, `s` is the last input string provided, `a` is the first integer from the split string `s`, and `b` is the second integer from the split string `s`. The loop has printed 'Bob' for every pair `(a, b)` where `(a + b) % 2 == 0` and 'Alice' otherwise.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `t` will still hold the initial value entered by the user, `i` will be one less than `t` because the loop runs from `0` to `t-1`, and `s`, `a`, and `b` will reflect the last input processed during the loop. The console will have printed 'Bob' for each pair where the sum of `a` and `b` is even, and 'Alice' for each pair where the sum is odd.
