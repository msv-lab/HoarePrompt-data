Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `i` is equal to `t - 1`, `s` is the last input string provided, `a` is the first integer from the split string `s`, and `b` is the integer value of the second element in the split string `s`. For each iteration of the loop, based on whether the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd, either "Bob" or "Alice" is printed, but the variables `a` and `b` themselves do not change throughout the loop's execution.
