Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `i` is \(i + 2\), `s` is the input string, `a` is the first integer from the split string `s`, `b` is the second integer from the split string `s`.**

Explanation: The code `s = input()` takes an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. The values of `t`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their previous states. The variable `i` is updated to `i + 2` due to the initial state given, but since no value for `i` was provided, it remains as `i + 2`. The variable `s` now holds the input string provided by the user, and `a` and `b` are the first and second integers from the split string `s`, respectively.
