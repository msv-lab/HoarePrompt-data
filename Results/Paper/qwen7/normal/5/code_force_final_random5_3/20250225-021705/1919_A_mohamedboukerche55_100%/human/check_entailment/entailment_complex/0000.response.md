Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the winner based on whether the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even or odd.
2. The annotated program correctly implements the logic:
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b` from the input.
   - It checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
   - It prints "Bob" if the sum is even and "Alice" if the sum is odd.
3. This logic aligns with the optimal strategy for the game as described in the problem statement:
   - If the sum of the coins is even, Bob wins because he can always force the sum to be even after Alice's turn.
   - If the sum of the coins is odd, Alice wins because she can always force the sum to be odd after Bob's turn.
4. The program handles the constraints correctly, reading up to 1000 test cases and values of `a` and `b` up to \(10^9\).

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
