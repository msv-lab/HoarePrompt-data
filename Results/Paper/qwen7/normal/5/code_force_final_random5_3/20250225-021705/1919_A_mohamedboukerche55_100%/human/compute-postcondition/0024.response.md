Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `i` is defined as \(i + 2\), but since `i` is not explicitly defined before this expression, it implies that `i` is being incremented by 2, but the exact value of `i` is not specified.
- `s` is an input string.
- `a` is the first integer from the split string `s`.
- `b` is the integer value of the second element in the split string `s`.

The `print('Bob')` statement simply prints the string "Bob" regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **Bob**
