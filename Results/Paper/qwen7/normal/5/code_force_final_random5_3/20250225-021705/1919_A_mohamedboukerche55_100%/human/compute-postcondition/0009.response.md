Output: **Alice**

Explanation: The initial state provides that `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `s` is an input string, `a` is the first integer from the split string `s`, and `b` is the second integer from the split string `s`. Additionally, it is mentioned that the sum of `a` and `b` is odd. However, the `print` statement simply outputs the string 'Alice', regardless of the values of `a` and `b`. Therefore, the output will be 'Alice'.
