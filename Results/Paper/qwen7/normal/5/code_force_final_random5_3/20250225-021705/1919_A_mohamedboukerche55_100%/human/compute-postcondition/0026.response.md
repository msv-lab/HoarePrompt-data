Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `i` is \(i + 2\), `s` is the input string, `a` is the first integer from the split string `s`, `b` is the integer value of the second element in the split string `s`. In both cases (whether `(a + b) % 2 == 0` is true or false), the values of `t`, `i`, `s`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
