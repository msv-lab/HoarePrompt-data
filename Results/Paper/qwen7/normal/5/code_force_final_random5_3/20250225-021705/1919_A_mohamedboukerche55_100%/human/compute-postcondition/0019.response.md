Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `i` is \(i + 1\), `s` is an updated input string, `a` is the first integer from the split string `s`, `b` is the second integer from the split string `s`. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged regardless of the condition `(a + b) % 2 == 0`.**
