Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is a non-negative integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, and `j` is 0, indicating that the condition `l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1` was never met during the loop's execution.
