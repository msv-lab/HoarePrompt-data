Output State: **`i` is 3, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` must be greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, and `j`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.
