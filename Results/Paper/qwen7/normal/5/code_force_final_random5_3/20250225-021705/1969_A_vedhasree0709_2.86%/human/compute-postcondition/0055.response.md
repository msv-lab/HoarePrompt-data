Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `j` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `n`, or `j`. It only indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since there is no loop or conditional block specified in the code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged.
