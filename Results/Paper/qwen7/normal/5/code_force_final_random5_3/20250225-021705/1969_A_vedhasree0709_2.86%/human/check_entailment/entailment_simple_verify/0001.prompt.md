You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and p is a list of n integers where each p_i satisfies 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct.

    #State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `t` will be an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` will be a non-negative integer, `l` will be a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, and `j` will be 0.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp needs to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party. A friend will come to the party if both the friend and their best friend receive an invitation.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program**:
   - The function `func()` takes input for the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `l`.
   - It then uses a while loop to check pairs of friends `(i, i+1)` to see if they can form a pair where both friends' best friends are themselves (i.e., `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`).
   - If such a pair is found, it prints `2` because inviting these two friends will ensure both come to the party.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`.

3. **Identifying Issues**:
   - The program assumes that the friends are indexed from `0` to `n-1`, but the problem states that indices start from `1` (e.g., `p_i != i`). This mismatch in indexing could lead to incorrect results.
   - The logic to check for pairs `(i, i+1)` is flawed. The condition `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1` does not correctly represent the problem constraints.
   - The program does not handle cases where there are cycles or more complex relationships among friends.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - The program should identify cycles in the friendship graph.
   - It should find the smallest cycle that includes at least two friends.
   - The minimum number of invitations needed would be the size of this cycle.

### Conclusion:

The provided program is incorrect due to the flawed logic and incorrect handling of indices. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
