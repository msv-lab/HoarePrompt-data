Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the new input string and converting each element to an integer where the current value of `l[i]` is 2, the current value of `l[i + 1]` is 1, `j` is 0**
