Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a list of integers where the current value of `l[0]` is 2, the current value of `l[1]` is 1, `j` is 1.**

The code `j = 1` updates the value of `j` to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
