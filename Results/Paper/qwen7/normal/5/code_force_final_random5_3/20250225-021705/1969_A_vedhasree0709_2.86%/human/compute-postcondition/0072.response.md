Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `l` is a list of integers converted from space-separated integers input by the user, `j` is 1.**

The value of `j` is explicitly set to 1, while the values of `i`, `t`, `n`, `l`, and the conditions on these variables remain unchanged.
