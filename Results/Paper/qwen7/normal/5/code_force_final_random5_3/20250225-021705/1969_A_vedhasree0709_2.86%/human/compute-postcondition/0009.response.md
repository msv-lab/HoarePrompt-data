Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` must be at least 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `j` is 1, and the current value of `l[i]` is 2, the current value of `l[i + 1]` is 1.**

The value of `j` is updated to 1, while all other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
