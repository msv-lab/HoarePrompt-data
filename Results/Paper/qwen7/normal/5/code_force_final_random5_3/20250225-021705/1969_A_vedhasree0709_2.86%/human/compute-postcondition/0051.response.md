Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 2**.

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The condition `n` is greater than or equal to 2 remains unchanged. The other conditions related to `l[i]` and `l[i + 1]` are not specified to be checked again, so they remain as the initial precondition.
