Output State: **`a` is a list with at least one element, `c` is a list containing elements from `a`, `x` is an integer equal to the last digit of `a[i]`, `n` is incremented by 1 or `n + 2` depending on the conditions inside the loop.**

Explanation: The code snippet assigns `x` the value of the last digit of `a[i]`, which is obtained using `a[i] % 10`. The values of `a` and `c` remain unchanged. The value of `n` is incremented by 1 or `n + 2` depending on the conditions inside the loop, but since those conditions are not specified, we keep it in the general form.
