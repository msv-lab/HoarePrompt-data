Postcondition: `a` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is either 1 or 2, `x` is the integer remainder of `a[1]` divided by 10, `y` is an integer equal to `a[1]` divided by 10, `c` is a list with either two or three elements depending on the condition (either `y` and `x` or `y`, `x`, and `a[1]`), and `n` is `n + 1` or `n + 2`.
