Postcondition: `a` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is either 1 or 2, `x` is the integer remainder of `a[1]` divided by 10, `y` is an integer equal to `a[1]` divided by 10, `c` is a list containing either two or three elements (depending on the condition `y <= x`), and `n` is either `n + 1` or `n + 2`. If `i` is 2, then `c` contains the element `a[1]`.
