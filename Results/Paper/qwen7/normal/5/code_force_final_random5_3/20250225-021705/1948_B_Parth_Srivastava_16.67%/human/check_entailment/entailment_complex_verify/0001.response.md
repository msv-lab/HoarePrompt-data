### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `m` and initializes an empty list `b` to store results.
2. **Loop Structure**:
   - The first loop (`for i in range(m): func_1()`) correctly calls the function `func_1()` for each test case.
   - The second loop (`for i in range(m):`) is indeed redundant and does not serve any purpose. It reprocesses the entire list `b` without any meaningful logic after the first loop.
3. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - The function correctly reads the size of the array `k` and the array elements.
   - It processes each element to check if it is greater than 10 and splits it into its constituent digits if necessary.
   - It maintains a list `c` to store the processed digits and checks if the final list `c` is sorted.
   - If the list `c` is sorted, it appends `1` to the list `b`; otherwise, it appends `0`.
4. **Output Handling**: The program prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the values in `b`, but the second loop is unnecessary and can be removed.

### Issues:
- The second loop (`for i in range(m):`) is redundant and does not serve any purpose. It can be removed.

### Conclusion:
The program is almost correct, but the second loop is unnecessary and can be removed. Removing this loop will make the code more efficient and clear.

### Corrected Program:
```python
m = int(input())
b = []
for i in range(m):
    func_1()
for i in range(m):
    if b[i] == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

def func_1():
    k = int(input())
    a = input().strip()
    a = list(map(int, a.split()))
    x = 0
    y = 0
    n = 0
    c = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] / 10)
            if y >= c[n - 1]:
                if y <= x:
                    c.append(y)
                    c.append(x)
                    n = n + 2
                else:
                    c.append(a[i])
                    n = n + 1
        elif i == 0 and a[i] > 10:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] / 10)
            if y <= x:
                c.append(y)
                c.append(x)
                n = n + 2
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
                n = n + 1
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
            n = n + 1
    d = sorted(c)
    if c == d:
        b.append(1)
    else:
        b.append(0)
```

### Final Answer:
The original assessment correctly identified that the second loop is redundant and can be removed. Therefore, the program is correct with the second loop removed.

**Final: True**
