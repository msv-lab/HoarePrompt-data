Output State: **`a` is a list with at least one element, `c` is a list containing elements from `a`, `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[i] / 10`, and `c` now contains an additional element `y`.**

Explanation: The code `c.append(y)` appends the value of `y` (which is the integer part of `a[i] / 10`) to the list `c`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `c` now includes the new element `y`.
