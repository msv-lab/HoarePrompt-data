Postcondition: **`n` is incremented by 1, `c` contains the value of `a[i]`, and either `c` contains `[x]` with `n` being `n + 2` (if `i` is 0, `a[i]` is greater than 10, `x` is the last digit of `a[0]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[0]` divided by 10, and `y` is less than or equal to `x`), or `c` contains `[a[0]]` with `n` being 1 (if `i` is 0, `a[i]` is greater than 10, `x` is the last digit of `a[0]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[0]` divided by 10, and `y` is greater than `x`), or `c` contains the value of `a[i]` with `n` being `n + 1` (if `n` is not incremented by 2 in the if part).**
