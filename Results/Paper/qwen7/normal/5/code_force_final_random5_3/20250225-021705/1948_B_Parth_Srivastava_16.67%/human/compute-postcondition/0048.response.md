Output State: **`a` is a list with at least one element, `c` is a list containing elements from `a`, `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`, `y` is the integer part of `a[i] / 10`**.

Explanation: The code `y = int(a[i] / 10)` calculates the integer division of `a[i]` by 10 and assigns the result to `y`. Since `a[i]` is an element of the list `a`, and `x` is defined as the last digit of `a[i]`, which is `a[i] % 10`, the value of `y` will be `a[i] // 10`. The other variables remain unchanged.
