Output State: **`a` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, `x` is the integer remainder of `a[1]` divided by 10, `y` is an integer equal to `a[1]` divided by 10.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a[i]` divided by 10 to `y`, where `i` is 1. So, `y` becomes the integer division result of `a[1]` by 10. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
