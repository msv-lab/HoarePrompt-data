Postcondition: `a` is a list with at least one element, `c` is a list containing elements from `a`. If `y <= x`, then `c` has an additional element `x`, where `x` is the last digit of `a[i]` and `y` is the integer part of `a[i] / 10`. Otherwise, `c` has an additional element `a[i]`, with `x` being the last digit of `a[i]` and `y` being the integer part of `a[i] / 10`. Additionally, `n` is either `n + 2` or `n + 1`.
