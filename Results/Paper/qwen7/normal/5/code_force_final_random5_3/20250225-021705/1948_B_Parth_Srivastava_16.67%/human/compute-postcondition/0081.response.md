Postcondition: `a` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is either 1 or 2, `x` is the integer remainder of `a[1]` divided by 10, `y` is an integer equal to `a[1]` divided by 10. If `y <= x`, then `c` is a list containing the values of `y` and `x`, and `n` is `n + 2`. Otherwise, `c` is a list with one element which is `a[1]`, and `n` is increased by 1.
