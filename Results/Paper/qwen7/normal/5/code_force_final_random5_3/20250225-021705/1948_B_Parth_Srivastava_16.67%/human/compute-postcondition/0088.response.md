Output State: **`a` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, `x` is the integer remainder of `a[1]` divided by 10, `y` is an integer equal to `a[1]` divided by 10, `c` is a list with two elements: `y` and `x`, `n` is `n + 2`.**

In this case, the code `n = n + 2` increments the value of `n` by 2. Since the initial state did not specify a particular value for `n`, the only change is that `n` is now `n + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
