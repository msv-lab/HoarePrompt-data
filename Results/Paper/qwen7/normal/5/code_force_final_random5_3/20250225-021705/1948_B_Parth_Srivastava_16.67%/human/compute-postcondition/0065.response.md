Postcondition: `a` is a list with at least one element, `c` is a list containing elements from `a` with an additional element either `x` or another element from `a`, `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`, `y` is the integer value of `a[i]` divided by 10, and `n` is incremented by either 1 or 2 based on the condition `y <= x`.
