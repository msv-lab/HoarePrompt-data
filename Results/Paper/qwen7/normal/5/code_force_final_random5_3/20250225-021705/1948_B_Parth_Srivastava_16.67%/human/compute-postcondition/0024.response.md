Postcondition: `len(a)` is at least 1, the first element of `a` is not 0, there exists an index `i` greater than 0 such that the element at index `i` in `a` is greater than 10 and the current value of `i` is greater than 0; `x` is the last digit of the element at index `i` in `a`; `y` is the integer part of the division of the element at index `i` in `a` by 10; `c` either contains the value of `x` or has an additional element which is the same as the element at index `i` in `a`; `y` is greater than or equal to `c[n - 1]`; `n` is either incremented by 1 or `n + 2` depending on whether `y` is less than or equal to `x`.
