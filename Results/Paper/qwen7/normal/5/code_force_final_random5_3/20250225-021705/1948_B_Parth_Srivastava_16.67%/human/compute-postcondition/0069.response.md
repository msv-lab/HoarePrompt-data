Postcondition: `a` is a list with at least one element, `c` is a list containing elements from `a`, `n` is incremented by either 1 or 2 depending on the following conditions: if `i == 0` and `a[i] > 10`, then `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`, `y` is the integer value of `a[i]` divided by 10, and `n` is incremented by either 1 or 2 depending on whether `y` is less than or equal to `x`. If the above condition is not met, `n` is incremented by 1.
