Output State: **`good_subarrays` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `k`, `m`, and `n` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n, and 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `b_freq` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in list `b`.**

The code `b_freq = Counter(b)` creates a `Counter` object named `b_freq` which counts the frequency of each element in the list `b`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
