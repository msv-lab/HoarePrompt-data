Postcondition: `count` is either 1 or 2, `i` is `x - 1`, `T` must be greater than or equal to 0, `num` is `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are input integers, `list0` is a list of integers created from user input, and `list0` is sorted. If `num` equals 1, then `count` is incremented to 2. Otherwise, `count` remains 1.
