Output State: **`T` is an integer obtained from `int(input())`, and it represents the number of test cases. All other variables are not yet defined.**

This means that the variable `T` has been updated to hold the integer value entered by the user, which represents the number of test cases. The other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of vertices) are not yet defined and will be initialized later within the context of each test case.
