Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the maximum difference in the x-coordinates will give one side length, and the maximum difference in the y-coordinates will give the other side length. However, since the square's sides are equal, the area is simply the square of the maximum difference in either the x or y coordinates.

The program iterates through the four given points to extract their x and y coordinates, finds the maximum and minimum values for both x and y, and then calculates the area as the square of the difference between the maximum and minimum values. This approach ensures that the program works correctly for any set of four points that form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes.

Given the constraints and the guarantees in the problem description, this program should handle all valid inputs correctly.
