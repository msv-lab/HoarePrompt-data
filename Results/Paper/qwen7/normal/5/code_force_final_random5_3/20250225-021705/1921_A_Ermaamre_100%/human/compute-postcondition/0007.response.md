Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1; `a` is a list containing 4 lists, each list contains integers inputted by the user.**

Explanation: The code creates a 4xN list `a`, where N is the number of integers inputted per line. Each element in `a` is an integer converted from the input. The initial condition that `t` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged. The exact values of the elements in `a` depend on the input provided by the user, but they are all integers.
