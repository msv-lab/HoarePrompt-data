Reasoning:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Coordinate Extraction**: For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates and stores them in a list of lists (`a`).
3. **Side Length Calculation**: It extracts the x-coordinates from the list of points and calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (`dx`), which represents the side length of the square.
4. **Area Calculation**: It then squares `dx` to get the area of the square and prints the result.

Given that the problem guarantees that the points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area, the logic implemented in the function is sound. The function correctly identifies the side length of the square and computes the area accurately.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
