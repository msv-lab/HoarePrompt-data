Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the area of the square. Given the constraints and the fact that the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the maximum difference between the x-coordinates (or y-coordinates) will give the side length of the square. Squaring this difference gives the area of the square. The program iterates over each test case, reads the coordinates of the four corners, extracts the x-coordinates, finds the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates, and then squares this difference to get the area. This approach is valid and will work for all the given test cases.
