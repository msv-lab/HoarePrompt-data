Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be equal to the number of test cases entered by the user. `a` will be a list containing 4 lists for each test case, where each of these 4 lists contains integers entered by the user. For each test case, `x` will be a list containing the first element from each of the 4 lists in `a`. The variable `dx` will be the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x` for each test case. Finally, the loop will print the square of `dx` for each test case.**

This output state describes the final conditions after the loop has completed all its iterations. The value of `t` reflects the total number of test cases, and for each test case, the calculations involving `a`, `x`, and `dx` are performed as specified in the loop body.
