Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by counting the number of segments needed to ensure the balance of '+' and '-' does not go negative. However, the logic in the function `func_1` is flawed. Specifically, the function does not correctly compute the minimum penalty as required by the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Segments**: The function `func_1` counts the number of times the balance goes negative but does not consider the optimal way to partition the array to minimize the penalty. For example, in the third test case (`--+++++++`), the function would incorrectly return 1 instead of 0 because it only counts the transitions from positive to negative balance.

2. **Penalty Calculation**: The function does not calculate the actual penalty as defined in the problem. The penalty is the sum of the absolute values of the sums of the segments multiplied by their lengths. The current implementation does not account for this calculation.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns the count of segments plus one if the balance is greater than zero, which is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
