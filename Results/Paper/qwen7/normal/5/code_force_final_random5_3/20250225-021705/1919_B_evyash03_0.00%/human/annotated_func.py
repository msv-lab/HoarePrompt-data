#State of the program right berfore the function call: expression is a string of length n consisting of characters "+" and "-", and length is an integer such that 1 <= length <= 5000.
def func_1(expression, length):
    count = 0
    balance = 0
    for char in expression:
        if char == '+':
            balance += 1
        elif char == '-':
            balance -= 1
        
        if balance < 0:
            count += 1
            balance = 0
        
    #State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `expression` is a non-empty string, `balance` is less than or equal to 0, and `count` is equal to the total number of iterations the loop has executed.
    return count + (balance > 0)
    #The program returns the total number of iterations the loop has executed plus 1 if the balance is greater than 0, otherwise it returns just the total number of iterations the loop has executed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `expression` consisting of '+' and '-' characters and an integer `length`. It counts the number of iterations the loop runs until the balance (difference between the number of '+' and '-') is greater than 0. If the balance becomes greater than 0, it returns the count plus 1; otherwise, it returns the count.
