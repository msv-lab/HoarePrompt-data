### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the provided code does not correctly implement the solution. Let's break down the issues and verify the program's behavior step-by-step using the annotated code.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to minimize the penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s`.
   - The penalty for a segment of the array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `expression`.
   - It splits the string `expression` at each `'-'` character, which means it considers segments between `'-'` characters as separate parts.
   - It then calls `func_1(expression, result_length)` with the `result_length` being the sum of lengths of these parts.
   - The function `func_1` counts the number of segments that need to be considered for the penalty calculation. It does this by iterating through the string and counting changes in the balance (from positive to negative), which indicates the start of a new segment.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - `count` is initialized to 0.
   - `balance` is initialized to 0.
   - It iterates through each character in the string:
     - If the character is `'+'`, it increments the `balance`.
     - If the character is `'-'`, it decrements the `balance`.
     - If the `balance` becomes negative, it increments `count` and resets `balance` to 0.
   - Finally, it returns `count` plus 1 if `balance` is greater than 0, indicating an incomplete segment at the end.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies the number of segments needed to split the array to minimize the penalty.
   - However, the main issue is that the function does not actually compute the penalty; it only counts the number of segments.
   - The main function does not handle the actual penalty calculation based on the segments identified.

Given the analysis, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution because it only counts the number of segments but does not calculate the actual penalty as per the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly compute the penalty as required by the problem statement.

**Final: False**
