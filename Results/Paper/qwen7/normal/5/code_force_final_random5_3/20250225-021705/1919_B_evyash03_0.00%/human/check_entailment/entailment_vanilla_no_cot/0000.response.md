Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Penalty**: The function `func_1` does not correctly compute the penalty as per the problem statement. It simply counts the number of segments where the balance goes negative, which is not relevant to the actual penalty calculation.

2. **Splitting Logic**: The program attempts to split the string based on the '-' character but does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty. The logic in `func_1` does not account for the actual penalty calculation as described in the problem.

3. **Penalty Calculation**: The penalty should be calculated based on the absolute value of the sum of each segment multiplied by its length. The current implementation does not perform this calculation.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to implement a dynamic programming approach or a greedy algorithm to find the optimal way to split the array such that the total penalty is minimized.
