Output State: **`p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `idx1` and `idx2` are either `n-1` or `n`, `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`, `m` is equal to 2, `a3` is the first integer input, `l3` is a list containing the rest of the integers input.**

Explanation: The code `val.append((a3, l3))` appends a tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. This means `val` now contains one tuple with `a3` and `l3` as its elements. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
