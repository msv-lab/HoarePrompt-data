Output State: **`p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `idx1` and `idx2` are either `n-1` or `n`, the value of `val` is an empty list, `l1` is a list with an element `a1` inserted at index `idx2`.**

Explanation: The code `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the value `a1` into the list `l1` at the index specified by `idx2`. Since `idx1 > idx2` holds true, `idx2` cannot be `n-1` (because if it were, `idx1` would have to be `n`, making `idx1 <= idx2` false). Therefore, `idx2` must be `n`. The values of `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, and `val` remain unchanged.
