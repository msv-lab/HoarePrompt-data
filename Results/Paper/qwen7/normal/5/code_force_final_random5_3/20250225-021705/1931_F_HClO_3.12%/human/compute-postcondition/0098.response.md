Output State: **`p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `idx1` and `idx2` are either `n-1` or `n`, the value of `val` is an empty list, `l1` is a list with an element `a1` inserted at index `idx2`, `l` is a reference to `l1`.**

Explanation: The line `l = l1` assigns `l1` to `l`, meaning `l` now references the same list object as `l1`. The values of `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `val`, and the content of `l1` remain unchanged.
