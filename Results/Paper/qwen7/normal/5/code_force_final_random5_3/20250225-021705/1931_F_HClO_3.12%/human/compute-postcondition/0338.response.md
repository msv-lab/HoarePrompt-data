Postcondition: `m` must be at least 5, `idx1` is either `i` (if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`) or -1 (otherwise), `idx2` is either -1 (if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`) or `i` (otherwise), `p1` is either 1 (if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`) or 0 (otherwise), `p2` is either 0 (if `l1[i + p1]` equals `a2`) or 1 (otherwise), and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
