Postcondition: **`p1` and `p2` are either 0 and 0, or 1 and 0, or 0 and 1; `idx1` and `idx2` are either `i` and `-1`, `-1` and `i`, or `i` and `i`; `n` is greater than 1; if both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. It states that `p1` and `p2` will be in one of the specified states (either 0 and 0, 1 and 0, or 0 and 1), `idx1` and `idx2` will be in one of the specified pairs (either `i` and `-1`, `-1` and `i`, or `i` and `i`), and `n` will remain greater than 1. Additionally, if both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, the most internal loop or if statement will be broken. Lastly, it specifies that `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`.
