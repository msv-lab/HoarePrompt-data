Output State: **`a3` is the first integer from the input converted to an integer, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input converted to integers, `t` must be greater than `current_index + 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input split and converted to an integer, `m` is the second integer from the input split and converted to an integer, an empty line is read.**

The `input()` function reads a line of input from the user, which is an empty line in this case since no specific input is mentioned. This does not change the values of the existing variables but updates the input buffer.
