Output State: `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, input has been taken `m-2` times but not stored or used.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations (i.e., `m-2` times), the value of `m` must still be greater than or equal to 3, and the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop have been taken but not stored or used in any variable.
