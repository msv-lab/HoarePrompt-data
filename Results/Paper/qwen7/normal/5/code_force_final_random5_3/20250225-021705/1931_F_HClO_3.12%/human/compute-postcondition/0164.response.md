Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(m - 2):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `m`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `m - 2 > 0` must hold true.
   - This simplifies to `m > 2`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `m` must be greater than or equal to 3.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `m` must be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to continue, and for the next iteration, `m` must be greater than 2 (which is already satisfied by the current state where `m >= 3`), we need to ensure that `m` remains greater than or equal to 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`m` must be greater than or equal to 3**
