Postcondition: `m` is at least 5, `a3` is the second integer from the first input converted to int, `l3` is the list of the remaining integers from the first input, excluding those equal to `a4`. If `l3` is not equal to the list of remaining integers from the first input excluding those equal to `a3`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains as described in the if part.
