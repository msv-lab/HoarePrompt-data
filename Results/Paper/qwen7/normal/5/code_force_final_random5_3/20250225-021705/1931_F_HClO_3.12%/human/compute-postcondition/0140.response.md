Output State: **`m` is at least 5, `a3` is the first integer from the first input converted to int, `l3` is the list of the remaining integers from the first input converted to int, and the next pair `(a4, l4)` is valid where `l4` is the list of the remaining integers from the first input, excluding those equal to `a4`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or the innermost if statement. Therefore, the values of `m`, `a3`, `l3`, `a4`, and `l4` remain unchanged, and we simply indicate that we have broken out of the loop or if statement.
