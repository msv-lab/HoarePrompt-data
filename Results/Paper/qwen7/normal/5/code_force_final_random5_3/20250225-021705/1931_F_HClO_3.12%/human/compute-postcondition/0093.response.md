Output State: **`p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `idx1` is less than `idx2`, `idx2` is either `n-1` or `n`, `val` is an empty list, `l2` is a list with an element `a2` inserted at index `idx1`.**

Explanation: The code `l2.insert(idx1, a2)` inserts the value `a2` into the list `l2` at the index `idx1`. Since `idx1` is less than `idx2` and `idx2` is either `n-1` or `n`, `idx1` must be less than `n-1` or `n`. The values of `p1`, `p2`, and `val` remain unchanged.
