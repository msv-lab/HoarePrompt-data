Postcondition: `a3` is the first element of the first tuple in `val`, `l3` is the second element of the first tuple in `val`, `val` is a list containing four tuples, each being a pair consisting of `a3` and `l3`, `m` is equal to 4, and the current value of `l3` is not equal to a list comprehension of all elements in `l` excluding `a3`.
