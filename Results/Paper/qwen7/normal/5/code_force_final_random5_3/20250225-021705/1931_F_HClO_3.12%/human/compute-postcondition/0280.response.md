Based on the initial state provided:

- `a3` is the first integer from the input converted to an integer.
- `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input converted to integers.
- The current value of `l3` is not equal to a list of all integers in `l` excluding `a3`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('no')
```

This print statement simply outputs the string `'no'`. Since no other variables or objects need to be evaluated or described further, the output is straightforward.

Output: **no**
