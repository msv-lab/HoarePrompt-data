Output State: **`idx1` is 2, `idx2` is 2, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `n-2`, `val` is an empty list, `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `l11`, `l22`, `l3`, `m`, `t` retain their original values, and `m` is equal to 2.**

The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop (if there was one) and moves to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the given code snippet, and the `continue` statement does not modify any variable values, the values of all variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
