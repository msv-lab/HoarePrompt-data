The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by positive integers \(n\) and \(m\), and lists of integers. For each test case, it checks if two modified lists can be made identical through specific operations. If possible, it prints 'yes' and constructs a list of additional tuples; otherwise, it prints 'no'. The function ultimately outputs 'yes' only if all constructed tuples maintain the required condition, or 'no' if any fail.
