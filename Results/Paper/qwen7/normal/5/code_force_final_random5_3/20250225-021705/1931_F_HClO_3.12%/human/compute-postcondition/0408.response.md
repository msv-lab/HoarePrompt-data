Postcondition: **`m` is at least 5, `idx1` is either `i`, `i+1`, ..., or `-1`, `idx2` is either `-1`, `i`, ..., or `i+1`, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-2`, `val` is an empty list, `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, `a3` is the first element of the input split and converted to an integer, `l3` is a list of the remaining elements of the input split and converted to integers. If the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, then `a1` is inserted into `l3` at index `idx2` and the resulting list is stored in `l`. Otherwise, `a2` is inserted into `l3` at index `idx1` and the resulting list is stored in `l`.**
