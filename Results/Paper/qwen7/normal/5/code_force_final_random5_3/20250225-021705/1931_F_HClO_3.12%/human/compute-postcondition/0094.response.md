Output State: **`p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `idx1` is less than `idx2`, `idx2` is either `n-1` or `n`, `val` is an empty list, `l2` is a list with an element `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, `l` is a reference to `l2`**.

Explanation: The line `l = l2` assigns `l2` to `l`, meaning `l` now references the same list object as `l2`. All other variables (`p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `val`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
