Output State: **`a3` is the first integer from the input converted to an integer, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input converted to integers, `t` must be greater than `current_index + 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input split and converted to an integer, `m` is the second integer from the input split and converted to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part to an integer. It assigns the first integer to `n` and the second integer to `m`. The initial values of `a3` and `l3` remain unchanged, and the condition for `t` also remains valid.
