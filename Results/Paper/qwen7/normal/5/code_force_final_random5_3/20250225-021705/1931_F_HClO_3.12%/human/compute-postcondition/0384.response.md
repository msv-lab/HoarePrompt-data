Output State: **`m` must be at least 5, `idx1` is either `i`, `i+1`, ..., or `-1`, `idx2` is either `-1`, `i`, ..., or `i+1`, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is `n-2`.**

In this final state after all iterations of the loop have executed, the variable `i` will have reached `n-2` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-2` (inclusive). The values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` will depend on the conditions within the loop. Specifically, `idx1` and `idx2` will be set to some value of `i` or `-1` based on the comparisons between elements of `l1` and `l2`. The values of `p1` and `p2` will be set to `1` if the corresponding conditions are met, otherwise they will remain `0`. The variables `m`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, and `n` will retain their conditions as described after the third iteration, with `n` remaining unchanged and `i` incremented to `n-2`.
