Output State: **`p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is `i`, `n` is greater than 1, the value of `i` plus the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n - 1`, or `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `l2[i + p2]`.**

Explanation: The code `idx2 = i` assigns the value of `i` to `idx2`. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions involving `n`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, and the relationship between elements of `l1` and `l2` remain the same as the initial state.
