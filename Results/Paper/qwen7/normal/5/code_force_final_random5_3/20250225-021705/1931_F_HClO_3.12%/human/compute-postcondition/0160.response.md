Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head uses `_` as the loop variable, which is a common practice when the loop variable is not used within the loop body. The loop runs for `m - 2` times.

2. **Determine the initial state needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop runs for `m - 2` times, meaning `m - 2` must be at least 1 (i.e., `m` must be at least 3).
   - Since `_` is not used in the loop body, no specific value is needed for `_`.

3. **Adjust the states based on the loop condition**:
   - The only state that directly affects the loop execution is `m`. Therefore, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3.

4. **List the necessary adjustments**:
   - `total` and other variables like `a1`, `l11`, `a3`, `l3`, `t`, `a2`, `l2`, and `l22` are not directly related to the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted.

Based on the above analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `m` being greater than or equal to 3.

**State: **`m` must be greater than or equal to 3**
