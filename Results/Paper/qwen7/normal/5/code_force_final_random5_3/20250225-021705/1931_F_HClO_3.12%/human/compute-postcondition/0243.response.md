Output State: **`idx1` is 2, `idx2` is 2, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `n-2`, `val` is an empty list, `a1` is inserted into `l1` at index `idx2`, `l11` retains its original values, `l22` retains its original values, `l3` retains its original values, `m` retains its original values, `t` retains its original values.**

Explanation: The code inserts `a1` into list `l1` at index `idx2`. Given that `idx1` and `idx2` are both 2 initially, `a1` is inserted into `l1` at index 2. The values of `idx1`, `p1`, `p2`, `i`, `val`, `l11`, `l22`, `l3`, `m`, and `t` remain unchanged.
