Output State: **`m` must be at least 5, `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `m`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the code, the values of these variables remain unchanged.
