Postcondition: **`p1` and `p2` are either 0 and 0, or 1 and 0, or 0 and 1; `idx1` and `idx2` are either `n-1` and `n-1`, or `n` and `n-1`, or `n-1` and `n`; `n` is greater than 1; if `i + max(p1, p2)` equals `n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. It indicates that the values of `p1` and `p2`, as well as `idx1` and `idx2`, remain consistent with the initial conditions specified in the precondition. Additionally, it specifies that if the condition `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` is met, the most internal loop or if statement will be broken out of.
