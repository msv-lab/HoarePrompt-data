Postcondition: `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `idx1` and `idx2` are either `n-1` or `n`, `val` is a list. If `idx1` is less than `idx2`, `l` is a list with an element `a2` inserted at index `idx1`, and `val` is an empty list. Otherwise, `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`, where `l3` is a list containing the rest of the integers input, and `l` is a reference to a list `l1` with an element `a1` inserted at index `idx2`, and `m` is equal to 1.
