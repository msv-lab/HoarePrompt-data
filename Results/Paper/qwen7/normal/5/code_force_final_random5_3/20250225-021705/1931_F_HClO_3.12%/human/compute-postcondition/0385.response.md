Output State: **`m` must be at least 5, `idx1` is either `i`, `i+1`, ..., or `-1`, `idx2` is either `-1`, `i`, ..., or `i+1`, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-2`, `val` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `val`. No other changes are made to the existing variables. Therefore, the output state includes the new list `val` along with the unchanged conditions and values of the other variables.
