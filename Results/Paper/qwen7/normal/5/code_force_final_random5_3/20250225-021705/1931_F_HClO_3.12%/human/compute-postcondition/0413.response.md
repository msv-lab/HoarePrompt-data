Postcondition: `m` must be at least 5, `idx1` is either `i`, `i+1`, ..., or `-1`, `idx2` is either `-1`, `i`, ..., or `i+1`, `p1` is either 1 or 0, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-2`, `val` is a list. If `idx1` is less than `idx2`, `a2` is inserted at index `idx1` in list `l2` and `l` is assigned the value of `l2`. Otherwise, if `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, `a1` is inserted at position `idx2` in list `l1` and `l` is assigned the value of `l1`. If `idx1` equals `idx2`, `m` is 4, `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`, where `a3` is the first element of the input split and converted to an integer, and `l3` is a list of the remaining elements of the input split and converted to integers.
