Output State: **`a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list containing the remaining integers from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a3` is the last integer from the first input converted to int, `l3` is an empty list, and `t` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `a1, *l1 = map(int, input().split())` takes the first line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the first element to `a1`. The rest of the elements are assigned to the list `l1`. The values of `m`, `a3`, `l3`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.
