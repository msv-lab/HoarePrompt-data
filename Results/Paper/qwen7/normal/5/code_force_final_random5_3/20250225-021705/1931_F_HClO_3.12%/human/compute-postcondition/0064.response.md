The code `idx2 = i` assigns the value of `i` to `idx2`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the updated values are:

- `p1` and `p2` are either 0 and 0, or 1 and 0, or 0 and 1;
- `idx1` and `idx2` are now `i+1` and `i`;
- `n` is greater than 1;
- if `i + max(p1, p2)` equals `n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement;
- `l1[i + 1 + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + 1 + p2]`.

Output State: **`p1` and `p2` are either 0 and 0, or 1 and 0, or 0 and 1; `idx1` and `idx2` are `i+1` and `i`; `n` is greater than 1; if `i + max(p1, p2)` equals `n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; `l1[i + 1 + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + 1 + p2]`.**
