Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a3` is the first integer from the input converted to an integer, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input converted to integers, `t` must be greater than `current_index + 1`, `n` is the first integer from the input split and converted to an integer (`a1`), `m` is the second integer from the input split and converted to an integer (not included in the list `l1`), `a2` is the third integer from the input split and converted to an integer, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the input split and converted to integers, `l11` is a list comprehension resulting in a list of elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list comprehension resulting in a list of elements from `l2` excluding `a1`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    input()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `m` must be at least 3, input() function waits for user input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `m` must be at least 3, input received but not stored or used

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `m` must be at least 4, input received but not stored or used




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
