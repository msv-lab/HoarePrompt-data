Postcondition: `idx1` and `idx2` are both 2, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `i` is `n-2`, `val` is either an empty list or a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3)`, where `a3` is the first integer entered and `l3` is a list containing the remaining integers entered, `a1` is inserted into `l1` at index `2` if `idx1 < idx2`, `m` is `m - 1` if `idx1 >= idx2`, and `t` retains its original value.
