Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `num` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each `num` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`. This means `num` starts from 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `max_score` is 1
   - `num` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `num` (which is now 2) must be in `count_a`

4. **Determine the next value of `num`**: Since the loop increments `num` by 1 each time, the next value of `num` will be 3.

5. **Check if the loop can continue**: For the loop to continue, `num` must be within the range from 1 to `n + 1`. Given that `num` is currently 2, the loop has already executed once. Therefore, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to continue.

6. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to update the state such that `num` is 3 and `n` is at least 2. Additionally, since `num` (now 3) must be in `count_a`, we need to ensure that `count_a` contains the value 3.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`max_score` is 1, `num` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, and `num` (which is now 3) must be in `count_a`**.
