Output State: **`num` is 2; `count_a[2]` is 1**

Explanation: The code `count_a[num] += 1` increments the value of `count_a[num]` by 1. Given that `num` is 2, `count_a[2]` is incremented by 1. Since `count_a[2]` was initially "yet to be updated" (which means its value was 0), after the increment, `count_a[2]` becomes 1. The value of `num` remains unchanged at 2.
