### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves a game where you and Nene take turns placing cards on a table. Nene always plays optimally to maximize her score while minimizing yours. The goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can get.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list `a` (representing the integers on your cards) and an integer `n` (the number of cards each player has).
   - It uses a dictionary `count_a` to count the occurrences of each number in `a`.
   - It then iterates through numbers from 1 to `n` and checks if any number appears exactly twice in `a`. If it does, it increments `max_score`.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The function correctly identifies numbers that appear exactly twice in the list `a`.
   - However, the function does not account for the strategic nature of Nene's play. Nene's strategy is to maximize her score and minimize yours, which means she will always try to prevent you from scoring points when possible.

4. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - For you to score a point, Nene must have already placed a card with the same number on the table. If Nene has a card with the same number, she will place it before you do to avoid giving you a point.
   - Therefore, the maximum number of points you can get is determined by the number of pairs of cards in your hand, minus the number of pairs Nene can block.

5. **Function Implementation**:
   - The function only counts the number of integers that appear exactly twice in `a`, which is not sufficient to determine the maximum points you can get considering Nene's optimal strategy.
   - The function should instead simulate the game and consider Nene's blocking strategy.

### Conclusion:
The provided function does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the maximum number of points you can get, given Nene's optimal strategy. Therefore, the function is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
