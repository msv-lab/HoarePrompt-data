Output State: **`num` is the next element in the list `a`, and `count_a[num]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `count_a[num] = 1` sets the value of `count_a[num]` to 1. Since `num` is the next element in the list `a` and `count_a[num]` was either incremented by 1 or set to 1 based on whether `num` was previously in `count_a`, after executing the code, `count_a[num]` is explicitly set to 1. The initial conditions for `num` and `count_a[num]` remain valid, just updated to reflect the new assignment.
