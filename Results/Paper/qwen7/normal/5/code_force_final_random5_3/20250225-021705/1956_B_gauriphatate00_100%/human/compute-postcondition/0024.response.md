Output State: **`max_score` is 1, `num` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `num` is in `count_a`, and the current value of `count_a[num]` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `max_score += 1` increments the value of `max_score` by 1. Initially, `max_score` is 0, so after executing the code, `max_score` becomes 1. The other variables (`num`, `n`, and `count_a`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
