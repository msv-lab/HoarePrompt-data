You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the lengths of the sticks a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key's value is incremented by 1 for every occurrence of that key in the original list `a`.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` will be empty since one element is processed in each iteration. The dictionary `cnt` will contain the count of each unique integer present in the original list `a`, with each count incremented by 1 for every occurrence of that integer in the list.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
        
    #State: `ans` is the sum of the floor division of each value in `cnt.values()` by 3, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a dictionary where each value represents the count of each unique integer in the original list `a` (each count incremented by 1 for every occurrence of that integer in the list).
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of the floor division of each value in cnt.values() by 3)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then enters a loop where it processes each test case.
   - Inside the loop, it calls `func_1()` but does not do anything else with `t`. This is incorrect because it should process all `t` test cases.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to process one test case.
   - It reads an integer `n`, which is the number of sticks.
   - It then reads a list of stick lengths `a`.
   - It initializes a dictionary `cnt` to count the occurrences of each stick length.
   - It iterates over the counts in `cnt` and calculates the number of complete triangles (since a triangle is the smallest polygon) that can be formed using the sticks.
   - Finally, it prints the result.

3. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic for counting the number of triangles (or more generally, the number of complete polygons) is correct. For each stick length, the number of complete polygons that can be formed is `x // 3`, where `x` is the count of that stick length.
   - However, the function should be called `t` times to process all test cases, not just once.

### Conclusion

The program is almost correct, but it fails to process all test cases. Therefore, the program needs to be modified to call `func_1` for each test case.

### Corrected Program

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
    print(ans)
```
