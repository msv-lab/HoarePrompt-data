Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`.**

The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged, and now `n` holds the value of the integer input. The precondition that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 is only applicable after the input has been received and converted to an integer. Since the input is not specified in the example, `n` is simply assigned the value of the integer input, which is within the given range.
