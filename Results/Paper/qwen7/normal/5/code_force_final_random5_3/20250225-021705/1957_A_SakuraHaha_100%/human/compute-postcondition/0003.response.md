Output State: **`ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, and `cnt` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary `cnt`. The values of `ans`, `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
