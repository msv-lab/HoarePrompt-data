Output State: **`ans` is 0 + next_x // 3 + x // 3, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a dictionary that must contain at least one non-zero value**

Explanation: The variable `ans` was initially set to `0 + next_x // 3`. After executing `ans += x // 3`, `ans` is updated to include `x // 3`. Therefore, the new value of `ans` is the sum of its original value (`0 + next_x // 3`) and the new addition (`x // 3`). All other variables remain unchanged.
