Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of sticks (`n`) and their lengths, storing these in a list `a`.
3. It then creates a dictionary `cnt` to count the occurrences of each stick length.
4. The logic inside the function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed. This is done by dividing the count of each stick length by 3 (since each polygon must have at least 3 sides) and summing these values.
5. The program correctly prints the result for each test case.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the program appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the solution.

Correctness: **True**
