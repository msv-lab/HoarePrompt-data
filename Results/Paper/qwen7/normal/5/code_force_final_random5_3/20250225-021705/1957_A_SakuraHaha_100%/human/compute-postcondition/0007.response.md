Output State: **`ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (with the first element removed), `cnt` is a dictionary where each key's value is incremented by 1 if the key exists, otherwise initialized to 1, and for every key x in `cnt`, its value is now `cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1`.**

This means that for every key `x` in the dictionary `cnt`, its value is incremented by 1 if the key already exists in the dictionary, or it is set to 1 if the key does not exist. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
