Output State: **`ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `cnt` is a dictionary with each key's value incremented by 1 if the key exists, otherwise initialized to 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the dictionary `cnt` by incrementing the count of the integer `x` (which is an element from the list `a`) by 1. If `x` is not already a key in `cnt`, it initializes the count to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
