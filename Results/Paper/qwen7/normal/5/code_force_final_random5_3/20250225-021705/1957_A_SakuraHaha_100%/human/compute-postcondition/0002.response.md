Output State: **`ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

The code initializes `ans` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or the list `a`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for these variables.
