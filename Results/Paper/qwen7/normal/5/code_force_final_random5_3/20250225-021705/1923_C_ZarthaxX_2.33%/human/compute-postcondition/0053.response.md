Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through predefined constraints: a positive integer t, an integer n, an integer q, an array c of length n containing positive integers not exceeding 10^9, and q queries defined by pairs of integers l_i and r_i representing subarray boundaries. For each query, it returns the sum of elements in the subarray from index l_i to r_i.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with its own set of n, q, array c, and q queries. It calculates and returns the sum of elements within specified subarray boundaries for each query.
