Output: **NO**

Explanation:
- `sumInRange` is calculated as `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.
- `onesInRange` is calculated as `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`.
- `q` is updated to `q - 2`.
- `l` and `r` are updated to new integer values obtained from input.
- `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 1 and the rest are 0.
- `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative sum of `nums` minus 1 up to that index.

Given the initial state, the `print('NO')` statement simply prints the string 'NO'. There are no variables or objects that need to be evaluated further since the statement is a direct print of a string.
