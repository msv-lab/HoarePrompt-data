You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, each test case contains n and q where 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5, an array c of length n where each element is a positive integer not exceeding 10^9, and q queries defined by pairs of integers l_i and r_i representing the subarray boundaries.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split(' '))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ones = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]

    #
    #To explain this output state in natural language:
    #After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `ones` will still have its first element as 1 and all other elements as 0. This is because the loop updates only `ones[i]` to `ones[i - 1] + 1` if `nums[i - 1]` is 1, but it does not change any other elements in `ones`. The variable `sum` will contain the cumulative sum of the elements in `nums` minus 1 up to each index. This means that `sum[i]` will be the sum of `nums[0] - 1, nums[1] - 1, ..., nums[i-1] - 1`. All other variables (`n`, `q`, `t`, `c`, `nums`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
1. **Good Array Definition**: An array `a` of length `m` is considered good if there exists another array `b` of the same length such that:
   - The sums of the elements of `a` and `b` are equal.
   - No element in `a` is equal to the corresponding element in `b`.
   - All elements in `b` are positive.

2. **Subarray Query**: We need to check if a given subarray of `c` is good.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `q`, followed by the array `c`.

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - The program initializes two arrays `ones` and `sum` to store cumulative counts and sums.
   - It iterates through the array `nums` to populate these arrays:
     - `ones[i]` stores the count of `1`s up to index `i-1`.
     - `sum[i]` stores the sum of elements from the start up to index `i-1` minus the count of `1`s.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, it checks if the subarray is good:
     - If the subarray length is 1, it prints `NO` because a single element cannot form a good array with the required properties.
     - It calculates the number of `1`s (`onesInRange`) and the sum of the subarray (`sumInRange`).
     - It uses the condition \(2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} \le \text{sumInRange}\) to determine if the subarray is good.

### Correctness Analysis
1. **Condition for Good Subarray**:
   - The condition \(2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} \le \text{sumInRange}\) simplifies to \(\text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) \le \text{sumInRange}\).
   - This condition ensures that the subarray can be transformed into another array `b` where the sum of `b` equals the sum of the subarray and no element in `b` is equal to the corresponding element in the subarray.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the subarray length is 1 by printing `NO`.

3. **Cumulative Arrays**:
   - The use of cumulative arrays `ones` and `sum` is efficient for calculating the required values for each query.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
