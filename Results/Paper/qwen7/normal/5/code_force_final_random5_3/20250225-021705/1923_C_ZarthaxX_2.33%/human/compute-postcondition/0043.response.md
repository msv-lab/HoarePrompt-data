Output State: **`l` and `r` are updated to new integer values obtained from input, `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 1 and the rest are 0, `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative sum of `nums` minus 1 up to that index, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, `q` is `q - 2`.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers `l` and `r` from the input, which updates the values of `l` and `r`. The other variables (`onesInRange`, `ones`, `sum`, `sumInRange`, and `q`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
