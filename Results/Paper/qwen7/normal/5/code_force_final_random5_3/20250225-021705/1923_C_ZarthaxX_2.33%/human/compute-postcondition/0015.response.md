Output State: `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 1 and the rest are 0, `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative sum of `nums` minus 1 up to that index.

To explain this output state in natural language:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `ones` will still have its first element as 1 and all other elements as 0. This is because the loop updates only `ones[i]` to `ones[i - 1] + 1` if `nums[i - 1]` is 1, but it does not change any other elements in `ones`. The variable `sum` will contain the cumulative sum of the elements in `nums` minus 1 up to each index. This means that `sum[i]` will be the sum of `nums[0] - 1, nums[1] - 1, ..., nums[i-1] - 1`. All other variables (`n`, `q`, `t`, `c`, `nums`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
