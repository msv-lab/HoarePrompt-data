Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated input, `q` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated input, `t` is a positive integer, `c` is an array of integers obtained from the remaining space-separated inputs, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0, `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `sum` with `n + 1` elements, each set to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `q`, `t`, `c`, `nums`, or `ones`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and only the `sum` list is updated.
