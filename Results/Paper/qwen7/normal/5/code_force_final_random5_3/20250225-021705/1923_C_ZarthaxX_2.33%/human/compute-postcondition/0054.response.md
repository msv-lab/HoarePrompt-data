Functionality: **The function processes a series of queries on a given array. It calculates and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether the sum of elements in a specified subarray meets a certain condition involving the count of 1s in that subarray. Specifically, for each query defined by indices \( l \) and \( r \), it checks if \( 2 \times \text{count of 1s in } [l, r] + (r - l + 1) - \text{count of 1s in } [l, r] \leq \text{sum of elements in } [l, r] \). If true, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, 'NO'. The function does not return any value but modifies global variables `ones` and `sum` during its execution.**
