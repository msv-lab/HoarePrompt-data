### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Analysis
1. **Good Array Definition**: An array `a` of length `m` is considered good if there exists another array `b` of the same length such that:
   - The sums of the elements of `a` and `b` are equal.
   - No element in `a` is equal to the corresponding element in `b`.
   - All elements in `b` are positive.

2. **Subarray Query**: We need to check if a given subarray of `c` is good.

#### Program Analysis
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `q`, followed by the array `c`.

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - The program initializes two arrays `ones` and `sum` to store cumulative counts and sums.
   - It iterates through the array `nums` to populate these arrays:
     - `ones[i]` stores the count of `1`s up to index `i-1`.
     - `sum[i]` stores the sum of elements from the start up to index `i-1` minus the count of `1`s.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, it checks if the subarray is good:
     - If the subarray length is 1, it prints `NO` because a single element cannot form a good array with the required properties.
     - It calculates the number of `1`s (`onesInRange`) and the sum of the subarray (`sumInRange`).
     - It uses the condition \(2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} \le \text{sumInRange}\) to determine if the subarray is good.

#### Correctness Analysis
1. **Condition for Good Subarray**:
   - The condition \(2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} \le \text{sumInRange}\) simplifies to \(\text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) \le \text{sumInRange}\).
   - This condition ensures that the subarray can be transformed into another array `b` where the sum of `b` equals the sum of the subarray and no element in `b` is equal to the corresponding element in the subarray.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the subarray length is 1 by printing `NO`.

3. **Cumulative Arrays**:
   - The use of cumulative arrays `ones` and `sum` is efficient for calculating the required values for each query.

#### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotations
- **Initialization**: The program correctly initializes the `ones` and `sum` arrays.
- **Cumulative Calculation**: The `ones` array correctly counts the number of `1`s up to each index, and the `sum` array correctly computes the sum of elements minus the count of `1`s up to each index.
- **Query Handling**: The program correctly processes each query by checking the condition and handling edge cases appropriately.

Given the annotations and the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
