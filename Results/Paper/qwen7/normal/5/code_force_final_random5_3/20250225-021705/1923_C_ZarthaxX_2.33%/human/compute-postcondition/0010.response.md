Output State: **`ones[3]` is 1, `ones[2]` is 0, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `q` is an integer, `t` is a positive integer, `c` is an array of integers, `nums` is a list of integers, `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0 except for the first element which is 1, `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0, `sum[3]` is `sum[2] + nums[2] - 1`, `sum[3]` is `sum[2] + nums[2] - 1`**

Explanation:
- The code updates the `sum` list such that `sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1`. Given that `i` is 3, the code calculates `sum[3]` as `sum[2] + nums[2] - 1`.
- Since `sum[2]` is 0 (as per the initial state), and `nums[2]` is 1 (from the given conditions), `sum[3]` becomes `0 + 1 - 1 = 0`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
