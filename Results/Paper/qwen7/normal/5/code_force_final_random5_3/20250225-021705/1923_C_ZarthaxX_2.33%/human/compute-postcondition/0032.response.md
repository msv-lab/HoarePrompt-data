Output State: **`onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 1 and the rest are 0, `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative sum of `nums` minus 1 up to that index, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, `q` is `q - 1`, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `l` and `r` are updated to the integers input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `l` and `r`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
