Postcondition: **`sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `q` is `q - 2`, `l` and `r` are updated to new integer values obtained from input, `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 1 and the rest are 0, `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative sum of `nums` minus 1 up to that index. If the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is true, no changes are made to `sumInRange`, `onesInRange`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `ones`, or `sum`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `sumInRange`, `onesInRange`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `ones`, or `sum`.**
