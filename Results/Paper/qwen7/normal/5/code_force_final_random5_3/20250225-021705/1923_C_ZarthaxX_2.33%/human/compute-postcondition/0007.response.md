Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is within the range from 1 to `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ones[i]` is 1
   - `ones[i - 1]` is 0
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `q` is an integer
   - `t` is a positive integer
   - `c` is an array of integers
   - `nums` is a list of integers
   - `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0 except for the first element which is 1
   - `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0
   - `sum[2]` is `sum[1] + nums[1] - 1`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` becomes 3.

5. **Check the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop will continue if `i` (which is now 3) is still within the range from 1 to `n + 1`.
   - Since `n` must be greater than 0, the loop will continue as long as `n` is at least 3.

6. **Update the relevant states**:
   - `i` is updated to 3.
   - `ones[i]` (which is `ones[3]`) will be set to 1.
   - `ones[i - 1]` (which is `ones[2]`) will be set to 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `ones[i]` is 0, `ones[i - 1]` is 1, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `q` is an integer, `t` is a positive integer, `c` is an array of integers, `nums` is a list of integers, `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0 except for the first element which is 1, `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0, `sum[3]` is `sum[2] + nums[2] - 1`.**

However, since the exact value of `sum[3]` is not given, we can represent it as `sum[3]` is `sum[2] + nums[2] - 1`.

So, the final state is:

**State: `ones[i]` is 0, `ones[i - 1]` is 1, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `q` is an integer, `t` is a positive integer, `c` is an array of integers, `nums` is a list of integers, `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0 except for the first element which is 1, `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0, `sum[3]` is `sum[2] + nums[2] - 1`.**
