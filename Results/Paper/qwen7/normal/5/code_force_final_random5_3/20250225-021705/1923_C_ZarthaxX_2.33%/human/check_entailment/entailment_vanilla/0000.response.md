### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if a subarray is "good" based on certain conditions.
   - A subarray is "good" if there exists another array `b` of the same length such that:
     1. The sums of the elements in both arrays are equal.
     2. No element in `a` is equal to the corresponding element in `b`.
     3. All elements in `b` are positive.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n`, the number of queries `q`, and the array `c`.
   - It then processes each query to check if the subarray from `l` to `r` is "good".
   - The logic used in `func_1()` is:
     - Calculate the number of 1s in the subarray using `ones` array.
     - Calculate the sum of the subarray excluding the 1s using `sum` array.
     - Check if the condition \(2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} \le \text{sumInRange}\) holds.
     - If the condition holds, the subarray is "good"; otherwise, it is not.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The condition \(2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} \le \text{sumInRange}\) simplifies to:
     \[
     \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) \le \text{sumInRange}
     \]
   - This condition ensures that the number of 1s plus the sum of the rest of the elements in the subarray is sufficient to form a "good" subarray where each element can be replaced with a positive integer different from itself.
   - The logic seems to correctly implement the necessary checks for the subarray to be "good".

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `l == r` by printing "NO", which is correct because a single-element subarray cannot satisfy the conditions for being "good".
   - The program processes each query independently, which is appropriate for the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the provided conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
