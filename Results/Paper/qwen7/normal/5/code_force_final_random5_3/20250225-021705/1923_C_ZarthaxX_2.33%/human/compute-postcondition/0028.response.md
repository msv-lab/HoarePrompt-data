Postcondition: **`onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 1 and the rest are 0, `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative sum of `nums` minus 1 up to that index, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, `q` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, and `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange > sumInRange`**
