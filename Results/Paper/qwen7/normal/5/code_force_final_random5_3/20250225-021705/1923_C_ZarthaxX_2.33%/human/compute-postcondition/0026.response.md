Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 1 and the rest are 0. This means `ones` looks like `[1, 0, 0, ..., 0]`.
   - `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative sum of `nums` minus 1 up to that index. Since no specific `nums` list is provided, we can infer that `sum` is also a list of zeros except for the first element, which might be influenced by the subtraction of 1 from the cumulative sum.
   - `onesInRange` is defined as `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`. Given the structure of `ones`, if `l > 1`, then `ones[l-1]` will be 0 and `ones[r]` will be either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `r`. If `l = 1`, then `ones[l-1]` is 1, so `onesInRange` will be 0 if `r > 0` and 1 if `r = 0`.
   - `sumInRange` is defined as `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`. Since `sum` is a list of zeros, `sumInRange` will be 0 regardless of the values of `l` and `r`.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - The condition `(2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange)` simplifies to `(2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= 0)`, which further simplifies to `(onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= 0)`.
   - Given that `sumInRange` is always 0, this condition must hold true for the print statement to execute.

3. **Print Statement Execution:**
   - The print statement simply outputs `'YES'`.

Based on the above analysis, the print statement will output `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
