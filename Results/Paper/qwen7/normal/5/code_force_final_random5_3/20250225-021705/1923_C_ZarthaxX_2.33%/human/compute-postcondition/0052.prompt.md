Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 1 and the rest are 0, `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative sum of `nums` minus 1 up to that index.

To explain this output state in natural language:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `ones` will still have its first element as 1 and all other elements as 0. This is because the loop updates only `ones[i]` to `ones[i - 1] + 1` if `nums[i - 1]` is 1, but it does not change any other elements in `ones`. The variable `sum` will contain the cumulative sum of the elements in `nums` minus 1 up to each index. This means that `sum[i]` will be the sum of `nums[0] - 1, nums[1] - 1, ..., nums[i-1] - 1`. All other variables (`n`, `q`, `t`, `c`, `nums`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))
    if l == r:
        print('NO')
        continue
    onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
    sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
    if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 1 and the rest are 0, `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative sum of `nums` minus 1 up to that index, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, `q` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, and if the condition `(2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange)` is satisfied, the function does nothing. Otherwise, the function ensures that the condition `(2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange > sumInRange)` holds true.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 1 and the rest are 0, `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative sum of `nums` minus 1 up to that index, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, `q` is `q - 1`, `l` and `r` are updated to the integers input by the user, and the loop continues if `l` equals `r`. If the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is true, then the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, the same condition is checked again in the next iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `q` is `q - 2`, `l` and `r` are updated to new integer values obtained from input, `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 1 and the rest are 0, `sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the cumulative sum of `nums` minus 1 up to that index. If the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is true, no changes are made to `sumInRange`, `onesInRange`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `ones`, or `sum`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `sumInRange`, `onesInRange`, `q`, `l`, `r`, `ones`, or `sum`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
