Reasoning:
1. The annotated program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the list and checking if the list is sorted. However, the main logic for performing the specified operations (splitting elements into their digits) is missing.
2. The function `func_1` correctly checks if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
3. The main loop iterates through the list starting from the second element, but it does not actually perform the digit-splitting operation as described in the problem statement. Instead, it checks if the previous element is greater than the current element and if the previous element is greater than 10, then it splits the previous element into its digits and inserts them back into the list.
4. This approach does not correctly implement the digit-splitting operation because it only checks and potentially modifies one element at a time without ensuring the entire list is processed according to the rules.
5. The program does not guarantee that after performing the digit-splitting operations, the list will be sorted. The logic for applying the operations is incomplete and flawed.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the required operations and cannot reliably determine if the list can be made sorted.

Correctness: **False**
