Output State: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is the input string, `b` is the new input string, `c` is the input from the user, `l` is 'NO'.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations (from `i=0` to `i=n-1`), the variable `i` will be equal to `n`. The loop sets `l` to 'YES' only if both `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]` are true for any index `i` within the range of `n`. If none of the conditions `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]` are met for any `i` from `0` to `n-1`, then `l` remains 'NO'.
