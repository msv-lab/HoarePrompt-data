Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a new input string, `b` is the new input from the user, `c` is the input from the user, `l` is 'YES'. This is because if `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]` are both true, then `l` is set to 'YES'. If either condition is false, `l` remains 'NO', and since there is no else part, `l` stays unchanged.
