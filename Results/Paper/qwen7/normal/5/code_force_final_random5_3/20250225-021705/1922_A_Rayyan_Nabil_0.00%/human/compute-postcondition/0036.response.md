Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - The postcondition about `l` (whether `l` is 'YES' or not) does not affect the loop continuation logic directly.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 2 in the next iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 0 (as it was at the end of the previous iteration).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is 2
- `n` must be greater than 0

Since the postcondition about `l` does not change the loop continuation logic, it remains unchanged for the purpose of determining the next state.

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0**
