Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string, `b` is the new input from the user, `c` is the input from the user, `l` is 'NO', `c` is the new input from the user**.

Explanation: The code `c = input()` assigns the value of the user's new input to the variable `c`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
