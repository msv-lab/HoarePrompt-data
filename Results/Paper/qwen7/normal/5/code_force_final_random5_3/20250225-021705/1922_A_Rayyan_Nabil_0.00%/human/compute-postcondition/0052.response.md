Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a new input string, `b` is the new input from the user, `c` is the input from the user, `l` is 'YES'. This occurs if `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`. If the condition is not met, the value of `l` remains 'NO'**.
