Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n`, where `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a new input string.
- `b` is the new input from the user.
- `c` is the input from the user.
- `l` is 'YES'.

The condition for `l` to remain 'YES' is that for every index `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`, either `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`. If there exists any index where both conditions are false (`a[i] == c[i]` and `b[i] == c[i]`), then `l` becomes 'NO'.

Given that the loop has executed all its iterations and `l` remains 'YES', it means that for every index `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`, the condition `a[i] != c[i] or b[i] != c[i]` holds true.

Therefore, the value of `l` is 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
