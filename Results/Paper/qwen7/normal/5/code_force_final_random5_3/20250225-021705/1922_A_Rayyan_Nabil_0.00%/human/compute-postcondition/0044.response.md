Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string, `b` is the new input string, `c` is the input from the user, `l` is 'NO'**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `l`) remain unchanged.
