Output State: `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` and `c` are lists of integers with the same length, the first element of `a` is not equal to the first element of `c`, the first element of `b` is not equal to the first element of `c`, and `l` is 'YES'. If `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` for all iterations, `l` remains 'YES'. If any iteration does not meet the condition (`a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`), then `l` would be set to 'NO'. Since the loop completes all iterations without breaking, `l` remains 'YES' if the condition holds true for all elements.
