Postcondition: **`tests` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 1; `a` is an input string from the user; `b` is a new input string from the user; `c` is an input string from the user; `no` is False; `counter` equals the length of string `c`; `slength` is an input integer.** 

This postcondition covers both cases of the if-else block. If `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, `no` will be set to False and `counter` will remain as the length of string `c`. If `c` does not match `a` or `b`, `no` will already be False and `counter` will be incremented to equal the length of `c`.
