You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    a
    
    b

    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program: 
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        no = True
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            counter = 0
            for x in c:
                if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
                    no = False
                    print('YES')
                    break
                counter += 1
        if no:
            print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and a, b, and c are strings consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        c = input()
        
        no = True
        
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            counter = 0
            for x in c:
                if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
                    no = False
                    print('YES')
                    break
                counter += 1
        
        if no:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: `tests` must be greater than 0, `i` is equal to `tests` - 1, `slength` is an input integer for each iteration, `a` is an input string for each iteration, `b` is an input string for each iteration, `c` is an input string for each iteration, `no` is False for each iteration, and `counter` equals the length of the corresponding string `c` for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two input strings \(a\) and \(b\), and one string \(c\). For each test case, it checks if \(c\) contains any character that does not appear in either \(a\) or \(b\). If \(c\) matches either \(a\) or \(b\), or if every character in \(c\) is found in both \(a\) and \(b\), the function prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function reads the number of test cases, the length of the strings, and the strings themselves for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Handling**: The function correctly handles multiple test cases by using `tests = int(input())` and iterating over each test case with `for i in range(tests)`.

2. **String Length Handling**: It correctly reads the length of the strings `slength = int(input())`.

3. **Reading Strings**: The function reads the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` as expected.

4. **Initial No Match Check**: The logic checks if `c` is exactly equal to `a` or `b`. If this is true, it immediately prints "NO" because `c` would match the template if it were equal to either `a` or `b`.

5. **Template Validation Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over each character in `c` and checks if the character is not present in both `a` and `b` at the corresponding index.
   - If the character in `c` is not found in both `a` and `b` at the same index, it means that a valid template can exist where `a` and `b` match but `c` does not. In this case, it prints "YES" and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without finding such a character, it means that no valid template exists, and it prints "NO".

6. **Final Output**: The function correctly prints "NO" if no valid template exists after checking all characters.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template such that `a` and `b` match it while `c` does not. The logic is sound and handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
