Output State: **`tests` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `tests` ≤ 1000.**

The code `tests = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `tests`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `tests` is now assigned the value of the input integer, the output state reflects that `tests` is an integer within the same range. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
