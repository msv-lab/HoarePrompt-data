Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tests` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `tests` ≤ 1000.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(tests):
    slength = int(input())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    c = input()
    no = True
    if c == a or c == b:
        no = False
        print('NO')
    else:
        counter = 0
        for x in c:
            if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
                no = False
                print('YES')
                break
            counter += 1
    if no:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`tests` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be 0; `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string from user, `c` is an empty input string; `no` is True. `counter` equals the length of string `c`, indicating that every character in `c` was checked against `a` and `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tests` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 1; `a` is an input string from the user; `b` is a new input string from the user; `c` is an input string from the user; `no` is True; `counter` equals the length of string `c`; `slength` is an input integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`tests` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string from the user, `c` is an empty string, `counter` is equal to the length of the original `c`, and `no` remains False.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
