Output State: **`counter` is incremented by 1, `c` is a non-empty string that is one character shorter than it was at the end of the previous iteration, `no` is False**

Explanation: The line `no = False` does not change the value of `counter` or `c`. It only assigns the value `False` to the variable `no`, which was already `False` in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `counter` and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states.
