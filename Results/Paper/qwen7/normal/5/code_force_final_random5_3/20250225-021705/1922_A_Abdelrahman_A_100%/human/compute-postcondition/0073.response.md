Output State: **All elements in `c` have been checked against `a` and `b`. The value of `no` is False. The variable `counter` has been incremented to equal the length of `c`.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, it means every character in `c` has been compared with the corresponding elements in `a` and `b`. Since the loop breaks when it finds a character in `c` that is not in either `a[counter]` or `b[counter]`, setting `no` to `False`, and incrementing `counter` for each iteration, by the end of the loop, `counter` will be equal to the length of `c`, and `no` will still be `False` because the loop would have broken on the first mismatch.
