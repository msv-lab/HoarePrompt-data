Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts of substrings.
2. The provided code has two functions:
   - `func_1()`: This function processes a single binary string and calculates the cost based on the transitions from '1' to '0'. However, this approach does not account for the actual minimum cost required to sort the string through cyclic shifts.
   - `func_2()`: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1()` for each test case. However, `func_1()` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for sorting the string via cyclic shifts.

3. The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost for sorting the string using cyclic shifts. Instead, it incorrectly sums the positions of transitions from '1' to '0', which does not reflect the actual cost of cyclic shifts needed to sort the string.

4. The problem requires a different approach to solve, such as identifying the longest sorted suffix and calculating the cost based on the length of the string minus the length of this suffix.

Given these points, the provided functions do not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
