### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order. The logic in `func_1` indeed assumes that every occurrence of '0' followed by '1's should be treated as a separate operation, which is not always the case. This approach fails to capture the optimal strategy for performing cyclic shifts.

To illustrate, let's consider the input string "101011":

1. The program would treat the first '0' and all '1's after it as one operation, resulting in a cost of 4 (since there are 3 '1's plus the '0').
2. It would then treat the second '0' and all '1's after it as another operation, resulting in a cost of 4 (again, 3 '1's plus the '0').

However, the optimal strategy involves:
1. Choosing the substring [1, 3]: "101011" -> "010111". Cost: 3.
2. Choosing the substring [2, 5]: "010111" -> "001111". Cost: 4.
3. Choosing the substring [3, 6]: "001111" -> "000111". Cost: 4.
The total cost is 3 + 4 + 4 = 11.

The program's logic does not account for the possibility of combining these operations to achieve the minimum cost. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order.
