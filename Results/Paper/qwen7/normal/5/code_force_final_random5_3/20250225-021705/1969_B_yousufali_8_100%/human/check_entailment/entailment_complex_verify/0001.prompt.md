You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    s = input()
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            n += 1
        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a binary string (consisting only of '0's and '1's), and n is an integer representing the count of '1's encountered up to the current index during iteration.
def func_1():
    s = input()
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            n += 1
        
        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of `s`, `n` will be the count of '1's in the string `s`, and `ans` will be the sum of `n + 1` for each occurrence of '0' followed by a '1'.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of n + 1 for each occurrence of '0' followed by a '1' in the string s)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a binary string `s` and calculates the sum of `n + 1` for each occurrence of '0' followed by a '1' in the string. It then prints this sum.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, the input is a binary string s (2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2⋅10^5) consisting of only '0's and '1's.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0.
    #
    #In natural language: The value of `t` must remain greater than 0 after all the iterations of the loop have finished. This is because the loop continues to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0, and there are no operations within the loop that change the value of `t`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it processes a binary string `s` (2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2⋅10^5) consisting of only '0's and '1's by calling `func_1()`. After processing all test cases, the value of `t` remains greater than 0.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to transform a binary string into a sorted (non-decreasing) order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings.
   - The cost of each operation is the length of the substring being shifted.
   - We need to find the minimum total cost to achieve this.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes a binary string `s` as input.
   - It iterates through the string and counts the number of '1's (`n`).
   - If it encounters a '0' after seeing at least one '1', it adds `n + 1` to the answer (`ans`).

3. **Behavior of `func_1`:**
   - This function does not actually perform any cyclic shifts.
   - Instead, it calculates a value that seems to be related to the positions of '0's and '1's in the string.
   - Specifically, it counts the cost of moving all '0's to the beginning of the string, treating each group of '1's as a separate operation.

4. **Correctness of `func_1`:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed because it does not account for the actual cyclic shifts needed to sort the string.
   - For example, consider the string "101011":
     - The function would count the cost as `3 + 3 + 3 = 9`, but the actual minimum cost is 5 (explained in the problem note).

5. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - Since `func_1` is incorrect, `func_2` will also produce incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts.

**Correctness: **False**
