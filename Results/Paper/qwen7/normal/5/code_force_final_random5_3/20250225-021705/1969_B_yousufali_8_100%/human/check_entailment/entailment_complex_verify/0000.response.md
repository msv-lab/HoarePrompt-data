### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why the provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to find the minimum total cost to sort a binary string by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. Each operation has a cost equal to the length of the chosen substring.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- The function iterates through the string `s` and counts the number of '1's (`n`) until it encounters a '0'.
- When a '0' is encountered, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`, assuming that the '0' and all preceding '1's form a separate operation.
- This approach is flawed because it does not consider the optimal way to perform cyclic shifts.

#### Example Analysis:
Consider the input string "101011":
- The function would count the first '0' and all preceding '1's as one operation, resulting in a cost of 4 (since `n + 1 = 3 + 1`).
- It would then count the second '0' and all preceding '1's as another operation, resulting in another cost of 4.
- However, the optimal solution involves:
  1. Choosing the substring [1, 3]: "101011" -> "010111". Cost: 3.
  2. Choosing the substring [2, 5]: "010111" -> "001111". Cost: 4.
  3. Choosing the substring [3, 6]: "001111" -> "000111". Cost: 4.
- The total cost is 3 + 4 + 4 = 11.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
- This function processes multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.
- It correctly handles the input and calls `func_1` for each test case, but `func_1` itself does not compute the minimum cost correctly.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order. Therefore, we should maintain the original assessment.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
