Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to distribute coins across different outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount we would receive back from any winning outcome. 

### Given Functions
1. **func_1(a, b)**:
   - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b`.
   - It uses the formula \( \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{|a \times b|}{\text{GCD}(a, b)} \).

2. **func_2(numbers)**:
   - This function calculates the LCM of a list of numbers.
   - It iteratively applies `func_1` to compute the LCM of all numbers in the list.

### Solution Approach
- For each test case, we need to find a distribution of coins such that the total bet is strictly less than the maximum possible winnings.
- The provided functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) are used to calculate the LCM, which is not directly relevant to solving the problem as stated.

### Correctness Check
1. **Understanding the Requirement**:
   - We need to ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the maximum possible winnings.
   - The LCM calculation in the provided functions does not help in achieving this goal.

2. **Solution Strategy**:
   - A simple strategy is to bet a fixed amount on each outcome. Let's denote this fixed amount as `x`.
   - The total bet would be \( n \times x \).
   - For the total bet to be strictly less than the maximum possible winnings, we need \( n \times x < \max(k_i) \times x \), where \( k_i \) are the multipliers.
   - Simplifying, we get \( n < \max(k_i) \).

3. **Implementation**:
   - If \( n < \max(k_i) \), we can set \( x = 1 \) for each outcome.
   - If \( n \geq \max(k_i) \), there is no valid distribution of coins that satisfies the condition, so we should output `-1`.

### Revised Program
```python
def solve(test_case):
    n = test_case[0]
    k = test_case[1]
    max_k = max(k)
    
    if n >= max_k:
        return [-1]
    else:
        return [1] * n

# Example usage
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(*solve([n, k]))
```

### Conclusion
The provided functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) are not necessary for solving the problem. The revised program correctly implements the logic to determine if a valid distribution of coins exists and outputs the appropriate result.

**Correctness: False**
