Output State: **All elements in the list except `list[i+2]` are now 0, and `list[i+2]` is now 0, `list[i]` is now 0 (since `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]` and `list[i - 1]` is greater than 0), `list[i - 1]` is now 0, `list[i + 1]` is now 0.**

Explanation: The code `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` subtracts `list[i - 1]` from itself, effectively setting `list[i - 1]` to 0. Since `list[i - 1]` was already greater than 0 before this operation, it is now 0. The other conditions and values of the list remain unchanged as per the initial state.
