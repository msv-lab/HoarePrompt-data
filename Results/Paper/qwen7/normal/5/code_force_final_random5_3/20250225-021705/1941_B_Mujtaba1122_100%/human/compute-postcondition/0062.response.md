Based on the initial state described:

- The list consists of zeros except for the last non-zero element, which will be \(-4 \times (n-1)\) if it was initially set to a non-zero value.
- All other elements will be 0.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement does not depend on any variables or the state of the list; it directly prints the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
