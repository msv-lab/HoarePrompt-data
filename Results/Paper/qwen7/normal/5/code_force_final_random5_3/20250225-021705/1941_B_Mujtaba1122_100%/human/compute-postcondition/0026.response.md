Output State: **`list[i]` is now `list[i] - 2 * list[i - 1]`, `list[i - 1]` is greater than 0, `list[i + 1]` is now `list[i + 1] - 2 * list[i - 1]`**

Explanation: The code `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]` updates the value of `list[i]` by subtracting `2 * list[i - 1]` from its current value. This matches the initial state where `list[i]` was already expressed as `list[i] - 2 * list[i - 1]`. The value of `list[i - 1]` remains unchanged and is still greater than 0. Additionally, the value of `list[i + 1]` is updated to `list[i + 1] - 2 * list[i - 1]`, which also matches the initial state.
