You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        if list[i - 1] != 0:
            print('no')
            return
    if func_1(list, n):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function accepts a list of integers and an integer n. It processes the list by repeatedly modifying its elements based on specific conditions. After processing, the list becomes a series of zeros, with the exception that the last non-zero element (either `list[0]` or `list[n-1]`) will be -4 * (n-1) if it was initially set to a non-zero value. The function prints 'YES' if `func_1(list, n)` returns True, otherwise it prints 'NO'.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` as soon as it finds an element that is not zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.
   - This function works correctly and serves its intended purpose.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to reduce the array to all zeros using the specified operations.
   - It iterates through the array from index 1 to n-2 (inclusive).
   - For each index `i`, it checks if the conditions `list[i] > 1`, `list[i-1] > 0`, and `list[i+1] > 0` are met.
   - If these conditions are met, it performs the operations:
     - `list[i+1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`
     - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i-1]`
     - `list[i-1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`
   - After performing the operations, it checks if `list[i-1]` is still not zero. If so, it prints 'NO' and returns immediately.
   - If the loop completes without printing 'NO', it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero. If they are, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Issues with the Given Program

1. **Logic of Operations**:
   - The operations performed in `func_2` do not always lead to the desired result of making all elements zero.
   - Specifically, the operations only reduce the values of the array but do not ensure that all elements can be reduced to zero under the given constraints.
   - For example, consider the array `[1, 3, 5, 5, 2]`. The operations might not be able to reduce all elements to zero due to the specific values and their relationships.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the initial array cannot be reduced to all zeros using the given operations.
   - For instance, if the sum of the elements in the array is odd, it is impossible to make all elements zero because each operation reduces the sum by an even number (2 from `a_i` and 1 from both `a_{i-1}` and `a_{i+1}`).

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
