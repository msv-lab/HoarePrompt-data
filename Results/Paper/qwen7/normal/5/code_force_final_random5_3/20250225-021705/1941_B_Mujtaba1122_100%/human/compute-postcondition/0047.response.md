Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is given by the expression `list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0)`.

2. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: For the loop to execute one more time, all parts of the loop condition must be true. We need to ensure that:
   - `list[i] > 1`
   - `list[i - 1] > 0`
   - `list[i + 1] > 0`

3. **Analyze the current state**:
   - `list[i - 1]` is now 0 (it was decreased by its own value).
   - `list[i]` is decreased by 2 times the original value of `list[i - 1]`.

Given these points, let's consider each part of the loop condition:
- Since `list[i - 1]` is now 0, it cannot satisfy the condition `list[i - 1] > 0`. Therefore, we need to adjust `list[i - 1]` to be greater than 0.
- The value of `list[i]` is irrelevant to the adjustment since the loop condition already requires `list[i] > 1`, and we don't have information about the original value of `list[i - 1]` to determine the exact new value of `list[i]`.
- `list[i + 1]` must be greater than 0 to satisfy the third part of the condition.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `list[i - 1]` must be greater than 0.
- `list[i + 1]` must be greater than 0.

State: **`list[i - 1]` must be greater than 0, `list[i + 1]` must be greater than 0**
