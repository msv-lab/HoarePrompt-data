Output State: **`list[i + 1]` is decreased by the value of `2 * list[i - 1]`, and `list[i - 1]` remains a positive number**.

Explanation: The code `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]` decreases the value of `list[i]` by twice the value of `list[i - 1]`. Since `list[i - 1]` is a positive number, `2 * list[i - 1]` is also a positive number. The value of `list[i + 1]` is not affected by this operation, so it remains as it was before, decreased by the value of `2 * list[i - 1]`. The value of `list[i - 1]` remains unchanged and is still a positive number.
