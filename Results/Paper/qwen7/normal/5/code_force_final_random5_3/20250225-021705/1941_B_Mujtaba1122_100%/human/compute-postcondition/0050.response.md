Output State: **`list[i - 1]` is 0; `list[i]` is decreased by 2 times `list[i - 1]`; `list[i + 1]` is decreased by `list[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` subtracts `list[i - 1]` from itself, effectively setting `list[i - 1]` to 0. The values of `list[i]` and `list[i + 1]` remain unchanged from their initial state, as they are not affected by this operation.
