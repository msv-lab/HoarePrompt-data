Output State: **`i` is 1; `list[0]` is -3; `list[1]` is 0; `list[2]` is greater than 0; `list[3]` is `list[2] - 1`.**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `i` is 1, `list[0]` is -1, `list[1]` is 2, `list[2]` is greater than 0, `list[3]` is `list[2] - 1`, and `list[1]` is decreased by 2 times `list[0]` and `list[0]` is decreased by 1 times itself.
- The code `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]` means `list[1] -= 2 * list[0]`.
- Substituting the initial values, `list[1]` becomes `2 - 2 * (-1) = 2 + 2 = 0`.
- After updating `list[1]`, the values of `i`, `list[0]`, `list[2]`, and `list[3]` remain unchanged as per the initial state, and `list[2]` is still greater than 0.
