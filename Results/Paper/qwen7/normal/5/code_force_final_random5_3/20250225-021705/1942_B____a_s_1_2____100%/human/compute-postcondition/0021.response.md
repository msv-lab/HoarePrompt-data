Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `mex` is `mex_initial`, `p` is `[-1] * n`, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new list `p` with `-1` repeated `n` times. The values of `i`, `mex`, and `p_initial` remain unchanged. The list `a` remains as it was initially.
