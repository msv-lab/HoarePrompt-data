Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`; `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `mex - a[i]` to `p[i]`. Given that `i` is `n - 1`, the value of `p[i]` is specifically `mex - a[n - 1]`. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged, and the precondition that `n` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
