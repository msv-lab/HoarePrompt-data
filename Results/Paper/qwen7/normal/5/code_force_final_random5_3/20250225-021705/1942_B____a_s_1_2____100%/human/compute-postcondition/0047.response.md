Output State: **`i` is `n-4`, `mex` is the minimum value between the previous `mex` and `p[i]`, and `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `p[i]` to `mex - a[i]`. However, since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `mex` and `a[i]`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `p[i]`. But we know that `mex` is updated to be the minimum value between its previous value and `p[i]` after this assignment. Therefore, the output state remains as described, with `i` unchanged as `n-4`, `mex` updated to be the minimum value between its previous value and `p[i]`, and `p[i]` updated to `mex - a[i]`.
