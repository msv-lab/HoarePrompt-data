Output State: **`i` is `n - 3`; `mex` is updated to the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`; `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`, where `i` is `n - 3`. The value of `p[i]` remains unchanged as it is only used in the comparison to update `mex`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated `mex` value and the unchanged `i` and `p[i]` values.
