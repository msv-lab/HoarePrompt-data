Precondition: **t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5. The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n, and it is guaranteed that there is at least one valid permutation p for the given data. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.**
