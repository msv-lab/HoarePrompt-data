Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(n - 1, -1, -1)`. This means the loop will iterate over the values of `i` starting from `n-1` down to `0`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i` equal to `n-1` and decrements by 1 until `i` reaches 0, the initial value of `i` must be `n-1`.

3. **Determine the Value of `n`**: The value of `n` must be such that the loop can execute. Given the range `range(n - 1, -1, -1)`, `n` must be at least 1 (since `n-1` should be a valid non-negative integer).

4. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`t`, `a`, `p`, and `mex`) are not directly involved in the loop head and their values do not affect whether the loop can execute. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` must be `n-1`
- `n` must be at least 1

So, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be at least 1**
