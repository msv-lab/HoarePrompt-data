Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is `n-3`
- `mex` is the minimum value between the previous `mex` and `p[i]`
- `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts from `n-1` and decrements `i` by 1 until it reaches `-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-3`.

2. **Variable `mex`:**
   - `mex` is updated based on the value of `p[i]` and the previous `mex`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `mex` is the minimum value between the previous `mex` and `p[i]`.

3. **Variable `p[i]`:**
   - `p[i]` is updated to `mex - a[i]`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`.

### Next Iteration
For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become `n-4`.

### Updated States
- `i` will be `n-4`.
- `mex` remains the same because it is not directly updated in the loop head but rather within the loop body.
- `p[i]` will be updated to `mex - a[i]` in the next iteration.

### Final State
State: **`i` is `n-4`, `mex` is the minimum value between the previous `mex` and `p[i]`, and `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`**.
