Output State: **`p[i]` is equal to `mex - a[i]`, `p[i+1]` is equal to `mex - a[i+1]`, `mex` is the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. The values of `p[i]` and `p[i+1]` remain unchanged from their initial state, which is `mex - a[i]` and `mex - a[i+1]` respectively. The value of `mex` is now adjusted to be the minimum of its original value and `p[i]`.
