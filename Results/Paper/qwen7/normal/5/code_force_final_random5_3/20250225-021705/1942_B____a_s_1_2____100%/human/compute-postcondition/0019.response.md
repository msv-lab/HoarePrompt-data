Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `mex` is `mex_initial`, `p` is `p_initial`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `n`. The values of `i`, `mex`, and `p` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still `n-1`, `mex` is still `mex_initial`, and `p` is still `p_initial`. The new value of `n` is an integer obtained from the user's input.
