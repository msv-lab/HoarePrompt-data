Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `p[i]` is equal to `mex - a[i]`
- `p[i+1]` is equal to `mex - a[i+1]`
- `mex` is the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`

### Loop Head:
```python
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts from `n-1` and goes down to `0`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was decremented by 1 from the value it had at the beginning of the current iteration.

2. **Variable `p[i]`:**
   - This value is updated inside the loop based on the current `mex` and `a[i]`.

3. **Variable `p[i+1]`:**
   - This value is updated inside the loop based on the current `mex` and `a[i+1]`.

4. **Variable `mex`:**
   - This value is updated inside the loop as the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`.

### Adjusting the States:
- **`i`**: Since the loop is decrementing `i` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1` (decremented by 1).
- **`p[i]`**: This value will be updated based on the new `mex` and `a[i]` at the start of the next iteration.
- **`p[i+1]`**: This value will be updated based on the new `mex` and `a[i+1]` at the start of the next iteration.
- **`mex`**: This value will be updated based on the new `p[i]` at the start of the next iteration.

### New State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `p[i]` will be updated based on the new `mex` and `a[i]`.
- `p[i+1]` will be updated based on the new `mex` and `a[i+1]`.
- `mex` will be updated based on the new `p[i]`.

Since the exact values of `p[i]` and `p[i+1]` depend on the loop body, we cannot specify them precisely without the loop body. However, we can say that `mex` will be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`p[i]` is equal to `mex - a[i]` where `i` is incremented by 1, `p[i+1]` is equal to `mex - a[i+1]` where `i` is incremented by 1, `mex` is the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`**.

In a more concise form:
State: **`p[i+1]` is equal to `mex - a[i+1]`, `p[i+2]` is equal to `mex - a[i+2]`, `mex` is the minimum of its current value and `p[i+1]`**.
