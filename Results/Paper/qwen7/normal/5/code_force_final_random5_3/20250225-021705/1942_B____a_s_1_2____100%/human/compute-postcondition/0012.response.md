Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n-1` to `0` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`. This means `i` starts at `n-1` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `-1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `n - 2`
   - `mex` is updated to the minimum value between `mex` and `p[i]`
   - `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop decrements `i` by 1, the new value of `i` will be `n - 3`.
   - The values of `mex` and `p[i]` will be updated based on the current `i` value, but since we are only asked to adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we focus on `i`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be `n - 3`
   - `mex` and `p[i]` will be updated according to the loop body, but we don't need to specify their exact values as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is `n - 3`**
