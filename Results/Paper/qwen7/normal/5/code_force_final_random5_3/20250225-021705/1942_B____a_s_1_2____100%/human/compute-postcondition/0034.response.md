Based on the initial state provided, after the loop completes, the list `p` will contain the difference between `mex` and each element in `a`, and `mex` will be the smallest value in the updated `p` array. 

To break it down:
- `p[i]` for each index `i` from `0` to `n-1` will be equal to `mex - a[i]`.
- `mex` will be the minimum value found among all `p[i]` after updating `p[i]` for every index `i`.

Therefore, the `print(*p)` statement will print the elements of the list `p` separated by spaces.

Output: **mex - a[0] mex - a[1] ... mex - a[n-1]**
