Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into a list of strings using spaces as delimiters, and then converts each string in the list to an integer. The original values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and a new variable `a` is created with the list of integers.
