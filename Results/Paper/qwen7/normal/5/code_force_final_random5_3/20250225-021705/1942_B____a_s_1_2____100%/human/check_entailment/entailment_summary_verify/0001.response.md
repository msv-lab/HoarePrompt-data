### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the provided program and the function summary to ensure the correctness of the solution.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the permutation `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - A list `p` of size `n` is initialized with `-1` values.
   - A variable `mex` is set to `n`, which will be used to find the MEX value.

3. **Backward Iteration:**
   - The loop runs from `n-1` to `0` (inclusive).
   - For each index `i`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the permutation `p`.

#### Reasoning:

1. **Correct Calculation of MEX:**
   - The key idea is to calculate the MEX value for the suffix of the permutation starting from `i` to the end.
   - The value `mex - a[i]` ensures that the MEX value is correctly assigned to `p[i]` because `a[i]` is defined as `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
   - However, this approach might not always produce a valid permutation. Specifically, the value `mex - a[i]` should ensure that `p[i]` is a valid index that hasn't been used before in the prefix of the permutation.

2. **Updating MEX:**
   - The `mex` value is updated to be the minimum of the current `mex` and the newly calculated `p[i]`. This ensures that `mex` always holds the smallest unused index in the permutation.
   - However, the initialization of `p` with `-1` and the backward iteration might lead to issues if `p[i]` is not a valid index.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the calculated `p[i]` might not be a valid index. For example, if `a[i]` is large, `mex - a[i]` might result in a negative value or an index out of bounds.

#### Example Counterexample:

Consider the following input:
```
1
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

- The expected output should be a valid permutation `p` such that `a[i] = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
- One valid permutation is `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`.
- However, the program might produce an invalid permutation due to the backward iteration and the initialization of `p` with `-1`.

#### Correct Approach:

A correct approach would involve a forward iteration to ensure that each `p[i]` is a valid index and that the MEX condition is satisfied.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided program does not guarantee the generation of a valid permutation `p` in all cases. Therefore, the program is not correct.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
