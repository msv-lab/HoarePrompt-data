Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly initializes variables and reads the necessary inputs.
2. It iterates through the array `a` in reverse order, which is a key part of the algorithm to find a valid permutation `p`.
3. For each element `a[i]`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]` and updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. This ensures that `p[i]` is a valid value that hasn't appeared before in the permutation up to that point.
4. The loop correctly handles the construction of `p` for each test case.
5. The final printed permutation `p` satisfies the condition that `a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i`.

Given these points, the logic in the annotated program appears to be correct and should produce valid permutations `p` for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
