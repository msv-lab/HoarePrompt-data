Reasoning:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case individually. It reads \( n \) and \( m \) for each test case, which are the number of moves and the desired number of cubes, respectively.

2. **Condition Check**: For each test case, the program checks if \( n \geq m \) and if \( (n - m) \) is even. This ensures that the number of moves \( n \) is sufficient to achieve the desired number of cubes \( m \) and that the difference between \( n \) and \( m \) allows for an even number of additions and removals to balance out to \( m \).

3. **Output**: Based on the condition check, the program prints 'YES' if the conditions are met, indicating that it is possible to achieve \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the function, the program correctly determines whether it is possible to achieve the desired number of cubes after a given number of moves.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
