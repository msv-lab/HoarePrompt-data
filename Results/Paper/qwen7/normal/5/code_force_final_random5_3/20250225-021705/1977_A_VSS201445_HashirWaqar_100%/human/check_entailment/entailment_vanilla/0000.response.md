Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - It then iterates `t` times using `for _ in range(int(input()))`.

2. **Reading Test Case Inputs:**
   - Inside the loop, it reads two integers `n` and `m` using `map(int, input().split())`, which is correct for the problem statement.

3. **Condition Check:**
   - The condition `if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:` is used to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes.
     - `n >= m`: This ensures that the total number of moves (`n`) is at least as many as the target number of cubes (`m`).
     - `(n - m) % 2 == 0`: This checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even. This is because each move either adds or removes 1 cube, so the parity (odd/even nature) of the difference must be even to balance out.

4. **Output:**
   - If the condition is met, it prints 'YES' (case-insensitive).
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO' (case-insensitive).

### Verification Against Example Cases:

- **Test Case 1:** `n = 3`, `m = 3`
  - `3 >= 3` is true.
  - `(3 - 3) % 2 == 0` is true.
  - Output: `YES` (correct)

- **Test Case 2:** `n = 2`, `m = 4`
  - `2 >= 4` is false.
  - Output: `NO` (correct)

- **Test Case 3:** `n = 5`, `m = 3`
  - `5 >= 3` is true.
  - `(5 - 3) % 2 == 0` is true.
  - Output: `YES` (correct)

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
