Output: **NO**

Explanation: 
- The initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 100.
- `n` is the first integer entered by the user.
- `m` is the second integer entered by the user.
- Additionally, it is given that either `n < m` or `(n - m) % 2 != 0`.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`. Since the conditions on `n` and `m` do not affect the output of the print statement, the output remains constant regardless of the values of `n` and `m` as long as they satisfy the given conditions. Therefore, the output is simply the string `'NO'`.
