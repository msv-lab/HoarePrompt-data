Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `range(int(input()))` part of the for loop. This means that the loop will run as many times as the integer input provided by the user.

2. **Understand the Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as the user keeps providing inputs. Each iteration of the loop will take an integer input from the user.

3. **Determine the States to Adjust**: Since the loop head involves taking an integer input from the user, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is the input itself. The variables `t`, `n`, and `m` are not directly involved in the loop head and their values are not modified within the loop body (based on the information provided).

4. **Formulate the New State**: After each iteration, the user provides a new integer input. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will include the new input value.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the first integer entered by the user, and `m` is the second integer entered by the user. The new input for the next iteration is an integer provided by the user.**

Since the exact values of `n` and `m` are not specified to change within the loop, and the loop continues based on the new input, the state remains the same in terms of the constraints but includes the new input for the next iteration.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the first integer entered by the user, and `m` is the second integer entered by the user. The new input for the next iteration is an integer provided by the user.**
