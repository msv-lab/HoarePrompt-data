Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, the program reads two integers `n` and `m`.
3. The logic to determine if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves is correct:
   - `n >= m`: This ensures that there are enough moves to potentially achieve `m` cubes.
   - `(n - m) % 2 == 0`: This ensures that the difference between `n` and `m` is even, meaning that the number of additions and removals can balance out to result in `m` cubes.
4. The program prints "YES" if both conditions are satisfied, and "NO" otherwise.
5. The program does not modify the state of `t` after processing all test cases, which is consistent with the problem statement.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
