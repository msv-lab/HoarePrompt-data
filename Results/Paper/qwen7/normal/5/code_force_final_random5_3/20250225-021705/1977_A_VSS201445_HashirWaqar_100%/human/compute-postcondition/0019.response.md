Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `m` is the second integer entered by the user. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference between `n` and `m` is even, then no change is made to `t`. Otherwise, no change is made to `t`.
