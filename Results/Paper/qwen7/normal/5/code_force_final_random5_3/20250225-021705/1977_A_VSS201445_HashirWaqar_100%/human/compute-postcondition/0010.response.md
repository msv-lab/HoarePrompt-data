Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `n` is the integer entered by the user, `m` is the second integer entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input from the user and splits them based on space. These integers are then assigned to `n` and `m` respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
