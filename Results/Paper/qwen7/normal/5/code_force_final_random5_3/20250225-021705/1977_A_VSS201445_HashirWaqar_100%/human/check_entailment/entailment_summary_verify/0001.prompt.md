You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple pairs of positive integers \( n \) and \( m \) (where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 100 \)) from standard input, checks if \( n \geq m \) and if \( (n - m) \) is even, and prints 'YES' if both conditions are met for any pair; otherwise, it prints 'NO' for that pair. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each pair of integers.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which indicates the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Conditions for Validity**:
   - The program checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`.
   - It also checks if the difference `(n - m)` is even.

3. **Output**:
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Reasoning:

- **Initial Conditions**:
  - The problem states that in each move, Nikita either adds or removes exactly one cube.
  - Therefore, the total number of cubes in the tower after `n` moves can only change by an even number if the number of additions equals the number of removals.

- **Key Insight**:
  - To have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, the net effect of additions and removals must result in `m` cubes.
  - This means that the difference between the number of additions and removals must be `m`.
  - Since each move changes the count by 1, the total number of moves `n` must be at least `m` (because you need at least `m` moves to add `m` cubes).
  - Additionally, the difference `(n - m)` must be even because each move (addition or removal) changes the count by 1, and the parity (even or odd nature) of the difference must match the parity of the number of moves.

### Verification:

- **Case 1**: `n = 3`, `m = 3`
  - `n >= m` is true.
  - `(n - m) = 0`, which is even.
  - Output: "YES" (Correct).

- **Case 2**: `n = 2`, `m = 4`
  - `n >= m` is false.
  - Output: "NO" (Correct).

- **Case 3**: `n = 5`, `m = 3`
  - `n >= m` is true.
  - `(n - m) = 2`, which is even.
  - Output: "YES" (Correct).

Given that the conditions in the program correctly reflect the logic required to determine if `m` cubes can be achieved after `n` moves, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
