Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `index` is increased by `n`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the return value of `func_1(array)` to `result`. The function `func_1` is called with `array` as its argument. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 and `index` is increased by `n` remains unchanged. The value of `array` is a list of integers starting from `index - n` and having a length of `n`. The value of `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`, which could be any value depending on the implementation of `func_1`.
