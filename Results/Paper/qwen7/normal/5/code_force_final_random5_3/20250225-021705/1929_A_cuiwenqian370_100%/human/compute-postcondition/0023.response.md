Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `index` is increased by `2 * n + int(data[index]) + 2`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`, `results` list now contains the return value of `func_1(array)` as its last element, `n` is `int(data[index])`, `array` is a list of integers created from `data[index:index + n]`, `results` list has the return value of `func_1(array)` appended as its last element, `n` is `int(data[index])`, `array` is a list of integers created from `data[index:index + n]`, `index` is increased by `n`.**

Explanation: The code `index += n` increases the value of `index` by `n`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
