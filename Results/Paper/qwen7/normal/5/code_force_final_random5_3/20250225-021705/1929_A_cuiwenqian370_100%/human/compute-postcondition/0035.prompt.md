Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `index` is increased by the sum of `2 * n + int(data[index]) + (t - 1) * n`, `results` list contains the return values of `func_1(array)` for each iteration, where `array` is a list of integers created from `data[index:index + n]` for each iteration, and `n` is `int(data[index])` for each iteration.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` must still be greater than 0, indicating that there were enough elements in the `data` list to complete all iterations. The `index` variable will have been incremented by the total amount calculated, which includes the sum of `2 * n` for each of the `t-1` iterations plus `int(data[index])` for each of the `t` iterations. The `results` list will contain the return values of `func_1(array)` for each of the `t` iterations, with each `array` being a list of integers derived from the `data` list according to the specified slicing.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` must be greater than 0, `index` is set such that there are enough elements in `data` to create the required arrays, and `results` list contains at least one element

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` must be greater than 0, `index` is set such that there are enough elements in `data` to create the required arrays, and `results` list contains at least two elements

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` must be greater than 0, `index` is set such that there are enough elements in `data` to create the required arrays, and `results` list contains at least one element




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
