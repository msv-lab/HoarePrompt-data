Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution attempts to solve the problem but does not correctly maximize the beauty of the array. The function `func_1` calculates the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements after sorting the array. However, this approach does not necessarily yield the maximum possible beauty.

To maximize the beauty, we should aim to maximize the positive differences while minimizing the negative ones. The optimal strategy is to sort the array and then pair the smallest element with the largest element, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on. This way, we ensure that the differences are maximized when subtracted.

Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(len(array) // 2):
        beauty += array[-(i + 1)] - array[i]
    if len(array) % 2 == 1:
        beauty += array[-1]  # Add the middle element if the array has an odd length
    return beauty

def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[1])
        array = list(map(int, data[2:2 + n]))
        result = func_1(array)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage
func_2()
```

This corrected code will properly calculate the maximum beauty of the array by pairing the smallest and largest elements appropriately.
