Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `index` is increased by the sum of `2 * n + int(data[index]) + (t - 1) * n`, `results` list contains the return values of `func_1(array)` for each iteration, where `array` is a list of integers created from `data[index:index + n]` for each iteration, and `n` is `int(data[index])` for each iteration.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` must still be greater than 0, indicating that there were enough elements in the `data` list to complete all iterations. The `index` variable will have been incremented by the total amount calculated, which includes the sum of `2 * n` for each of the `t-1` iterations plus `int(data[index])` for each of the `t` iterations. The `results` list will contain the return values of `func_1(array)` for each of the `t` iterations, with each `array` being a list of integers derived from the `data` list according to the specified slicing.
