### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to find the maximum possible beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The beauty is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function sorts the array and then computes the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - Sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are minimized, which does not necessarily maximize the beauty.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - To maximize the beauty, we should aim to have the largest possible difference between the first and last elements, and the next largest differences between the remaining elements.
   - One effective strategy is to place the smallest element at one end and the largest element at the other end, and then arrange the remaining elements in increasing order between them.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the array `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`.
   - Sorting the array gives `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`, and the beauty computed by `func_1` is \(11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57\).
   - The optimal arrangement `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]` indeed yields a beauty of \(11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57\), which is the maximum possible beauty for this array.

5. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function reads input and processes multiple test cases using `func_1`.
   - It correctly processes each test case by calling `func_1` and printing the results.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - While `func_2` correctly processes the input and calls `func_1` for each test case, `func_1` itself does not guarantee the maximum beauty due to the sorting approach.
   - Therefore, the overall program is incorrect because it does not always produce the maximum possible beauty.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not always produce the maximum possible beauty for the given array, even though it correctly processes the input and calls the appropriate function.
