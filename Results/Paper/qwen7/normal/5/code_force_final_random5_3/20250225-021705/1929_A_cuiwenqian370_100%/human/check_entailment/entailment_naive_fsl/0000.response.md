Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the `func_1` function calculates the beauty of the array by sorting the array and then computing the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements. However, this approach does not guarantee the maximum beauty because sorting the array may not always yield the maximum possible beauty.

To achieve the maximum beauty, the elements should be arranged such that the largest difference between consecutive elements is maximized. One effective strategy is to place the smallest element at one end and the largest element at the other end, and then arrange the remaining elements in increasing order between them.

Here's an example to illustrate the issue:

Consider the input array `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`. The program would sort this array to `[54, 80, 90, 100, 43]` and then compute the beauty as:
\[ |80 - 54| + |90 - 80| + |100 - 90| + |43 - 100| = 26 + 10 + 10 + 57 = 93 \]

However, the optimal arrangement to maximize the beauty would be `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`, which gives:
\[ |54 - 43| + |80 - 54| + |90 - 80| + |100 - 90| = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57 \]

Thus, the program does not handle the problem correctly for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
