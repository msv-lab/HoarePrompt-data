Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `index` is increased by 2 * n + int(data[index]) + 2, `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`, `results` list now contains the return value of `func_1(array)` as its last element, `n` is `int(data[index])`, array is a list of integers created from `data[index:index + n]`, `results` list has the return value of `func_1(array)` appended as its last element, `n` is `int(data[index])`, `array` is a list of integers created from `data[index:index + n]`**.

Explanation: The code creates a list `array` by mapping each element in the slice of `data` from `index` to `index + n` (inclusive) to an integer. This does not change the values of `t`, `index`, `result`, `results`, `n`, or the condition that `t` must be greater than 0. The new list `array` is created based on the specified slice of `data`.
