You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
    return beauty

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(array)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers where the length of the list is at least 2 and each element in the list is an integer between 1 and \(10^9\).
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
        
    #State: Output State: `beauty` is the sum of absolute differences between every consecutive pair of elements in the `array`, `array` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is equal to the length of the `array`.
    #
    #In Natural Language: The final value of `beauty` will be the sum of the absolute differences between every pair of consecutive elements in the `array`. This summation starts from the first element to the second, then includes the difference between the second and third, and so on until the last pair of consecutive elements in the array. The variable `i` will be one more than the length of the `array` after the loop has completed all its iterations.
    return beauty
    #The program returns the sum of absolute differences between every pair of consecutive elements in the `array`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and returns the sum of absolute differences between every pair of consecutive elements in the list. After processing, the original list is sorted, and the function calculates the total beauty (sum of differences) which is returned to the caller.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and array is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9]. The function func_1(array) is expected to return an integer representing the maximum beauty of the array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(array)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `index` is increased by the sum of `2 * n + int(data[index]) + (t - 1) * n`, `results` list contains the return values of `func_1(array)` for each iteration, where `array` is a list of integers created from `data[index:index + n]` for each iteration, and `n` is `int(data[index])` for each iteration.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` must still be greater than 0, indicating that there were enough elements in the `data` list to complete all iterations. The `index` variable will have been incremented by the total amount calculated, which includes the sum of `2 * n` for each of the `t-1` iterations plus `int(data[index])` for each of the `t` iterations. The `results` list will contain the return values of `func_1(array)` for each of the `t` iterations, with each `array` being a list of integers derived from the `data` list according to the specified slicing.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `t` must be greater than 0, `index` is set such that there are no remaining elements in `data` that can be used to create any more arrays, and `results` list contains exactly `t` elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer n and a list of n integers. It calls `func_1(array)` for each test case to determine the maximum beauty of the array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. After processing all test cases, it prints the result for each test case. The final state of the program is that all results are printed, and the `data` list is fully consumed.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the `func_1` function calculates the beauty of the array by sorting the array and then computing the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements. However, this approach does not guarantee the maximum beauty because sorting the array may not always yield the maximum possible beauty.

To achieve the maximum beauty, the elements should be arranged such that the largest difference between consecutive elements is maximized. One effective strategy is to place the smallest element at one end and the largest element at the other end, and then arrange the remaining elements in increasing order between them.

Here's an example to illustrate the issue:

Consider the input array `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`. The program would sort this array to `[54, 80, 90, 100, 43]` and then compute the beauty as:
\[ |80 - 54| + |90 - 80| + |100 - 90| + |43 - 100| = 26 + 10 + 10 + 57 = 93 \]

However, the optimal arrangement to maximize the beauty would be `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`, which gives:
\[ |54 - 43| + |80 - 54| + |90 - 80| + |100 - 90| = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57 \]

Thus, the program does not handle the problem correctly for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
