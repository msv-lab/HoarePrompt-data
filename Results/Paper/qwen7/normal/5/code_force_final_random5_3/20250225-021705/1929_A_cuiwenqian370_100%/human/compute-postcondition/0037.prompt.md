You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and array is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9]. The function func_1(array) is expected to return an integer representing the maximum beauty of the array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(array)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `index` is increased by the sum of `2 * n + int(data[index]) + (t - 1) * n`, `results` list contains the return values of `func_1(array)` for each iteration, where `array` is a list of integers created from `data[index:index + n]` for each iteration, and `n` is `int(data[index])` for each iteration.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` must still be greater than 0, indicating that there were enough elements in the `data` list to complete all iterations. The `index` variable will have been incremented by the total amount calculated, which includes the sum of `2 * n` for each of the `t-1` iterations plus `int(data[index])` for each of the `t` iterations. The `results` list will contain the return values of `func_1(array)` for each of the `t` iterations, with each `array` being a list of integers derived from the `data` list according to the specified slicing.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `t` must be greater than 0, `index` is set such that there are no remaining elements in `data` that can be used to create any more arrays, and `results` list contains exactly `t` elements.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but is expected to work within a context where a variable t is defined, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives a list (array) of n integers, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and each integer is in the range [1, 10^9], and returns an integer representing the maximum beauty of the array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
