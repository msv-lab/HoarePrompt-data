Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The beauty is defined as the sum of the values (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all integers i from 2 to n.
2. The key insight is that to maximize the beauty, we should sort the array and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. This is because sorting ensures that the largest and smallest elements are at the ends, maximizing the positive differences.
3. `func_1` correctly implements this logic by sorting the array and calculating the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
4. `func_2` reads input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case. It correctly handles the input format and prints the results for each test case.
5. Given that both functions work as intended and the overall structure of the program meets the requirements of the problem, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
