Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to maximize the beauty of the array \( a \), defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
   - The beauty is calculated as \( \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) \).
   - To maximize this, we should arrange the elements such that the differences are maximized.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The beauty is maximized when the smallest element is placed at the beginning and the largest element is placed at the end of the array.
   - This ensures that the difference between the first and second elements is maximized, and so on.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function sorts the array and calculates the beauty.
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest and largest elements are placed at the beginning and end, respectively.
   - The loop then calculates the beauty as the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the input in a specific format and processing each test case separately.

### Verification

- **Sorting and Calculation**: 
  - The sorting in `func_1` ensures that the smallest and largest elements are placed at the appropriate positions.
  - The calculation of beauty using sorted elements is correct.

- **Input Handling**:
  - `func_2` correctly reads the input and processes each test case independently.
  - It uses the sorted array to calculate the beauty for each test case.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting and calculating the beauty as described.

**Correctness: True**
