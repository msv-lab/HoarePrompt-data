### Reasoning:

The original assessment accurately describes the problem and the steps taken by the program to solve it. Let's break down the key points and verify them using the provided annotated code.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
   - The beauty is calculated as \( \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) \).

2. **Key Insight**:
   - To maximize the beauty, the smallest element should be placed at the beginning and the largest element at the end of the array. This ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Sorting**: The function sorts the array, ensuring that the smallest and largest elements are placed at the beginning and end, respectively.
   - **Calculation**: The loop calculates the beauty as the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements. Since the array is sorted, the differences are maximized.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Input Handling**: The function reads input from stdin and processes multiple test cases. It correctly handles the input format and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - **Output**: The function prints the results for each test case, ensuring that the correct beauty values are outputted.

### Verification Using Annotated Code:

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - **Initial State**: The array is a list of integers.
  - **Sorting**: The array is sorted, placing the smallest element at the beginning and the largest at the end.
  - **Calculation**: The loop calculates the beauty as the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements.
  - **Final State**: The function returns the calculated beauty.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - **Initial State**: `t` is the number of test cases, and `data` contains the input for all test cases.
  - **Processing**: The function processes each test case by reading the necessary elements from `data`, sorting the array, and calculating the beauty.
  - **Output**: The function prints the results for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting and calculating the beauty as described. The original assessment accurately describes the program's behavior and reasoning.

**Final: True**

The given program is correct.
