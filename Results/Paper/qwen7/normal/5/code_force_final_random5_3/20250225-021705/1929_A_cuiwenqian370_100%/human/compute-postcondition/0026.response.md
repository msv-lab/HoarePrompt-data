Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `index` is increased by the sum of `n` for each iteration plus the length of `data` between `index` and the end of the last array creation, `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)` for the last iteration, `results` list contains the return value of `func_1(array)` for each iteration as its elements.

In more detail, after the loop executes all its iterations:
- `t` remains unchanged as it was set initially and does not affect the loop's termination condition within the given code.
- `index` is incremented by the sum of `n` for each of the `t` iterations plus the lengths of the arrays created during each iteration.
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)` for the last iteration of the loop.
- The `results` list contains the return value of `func_1(array)` for each iteration, with the last element being the return value of the final iteration.
