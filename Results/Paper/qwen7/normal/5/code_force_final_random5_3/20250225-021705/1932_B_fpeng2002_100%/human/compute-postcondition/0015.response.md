The loop head contains the variable `num_tests`. Therefore, the only state that can be adjusted is `num_tests`.

According to the code, the loop continues as long as `num_tests` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `num_tests` is greater than 0. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `num_tests` must be greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`num_tests` must be greater than or equal to 1**
