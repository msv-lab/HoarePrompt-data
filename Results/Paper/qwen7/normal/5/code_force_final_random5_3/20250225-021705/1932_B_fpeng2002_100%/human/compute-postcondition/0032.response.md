Output State: **`x` is an input list split from a string, `num_tests` is `num_tests - 1`, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `nums`. The variable `x` was previously set to `len(nums) - 1`, but since `nums` is now defined, `x` is no longer relevant in its previous form. The variable `num_tests` is decremented by 1, and `n` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
