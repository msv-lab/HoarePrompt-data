Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to calculate the year when the nth sign will occur based on the periodicities given. However, the logic used in the program does not correctly simulate the sequential occurrence of signs as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is not appropriate for finding the next occurrence of a sign after the previous one has occurred.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of all the periodicities, which would give us the year when all signs will occur sequentially. The current implementation does not achieve this. Instead, it seems to be attempting to find the next occurrence of each individual sign independently without considering the sequential nature of the occurrences.

Given the execution summary, the program's approach does not align with the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
