Output State: **`x` is 0; `start_year` is (start_year // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0].**

Explanation: The variable `start_year` is updated to the value of `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. Given that `x` is 0, the expression becomes `(start_year // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]`. Since the initial value of `x` is 0, and no other changes are made to `x` or `start_year`, the output state reflects the updated value of `start_year` based on its initial value and the value of `nums[0]`.
