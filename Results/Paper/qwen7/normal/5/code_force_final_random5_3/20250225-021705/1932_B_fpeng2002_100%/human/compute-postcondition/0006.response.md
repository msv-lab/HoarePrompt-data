Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for x in range(0, len(nums)):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `x`, `len(nums)`, and `nums`.

2. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - `num_tests` is an input integer with the constraint \(0 \leq \text{num\_tests} \leq 999\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces.
   - `start_year` is 0.

3. **Adjust the States for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will iterate over the indices of the list `nums`.
   - For the loop to execute, `nums` must contain at least one element (i.e., `len(nums)` must be at least 1).
   - The variable `x` will take values from 0 to `len(nums) - 1` during the loop iterations.

4. **Formulate the Final State:**
   - We need to ensure that `len(nums)` is at least 1 and `x` starts at 0.

Given these considerations, the final state should be:

State: **`num_tests` is an input integer - 1, 0 ≤ num_tests ≤ 999, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces that must have at least 1 element, `start_year` is 0, `x` is 0**.
