Output State: **`x` is 1; `start_year` is ((start_year // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1])**

Explanation: Initially, `x` is set to 1 and `start_year` is calculated as `(start_year // nums[0] + 1) * nums[0]`. After executing the line `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, since `x` is 1, `start_year` is updated to `((start_year // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1])`. The value of `x` remains unchanged, and the updated value of `start_year` reflects this new calculation.
