### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the given program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the year when the nth sign will occur. The formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` does not account for the sequential waiting period as described in the problem statement. Instead, it incorrectly updates `start_year` based on the current value of `start_year` and the current periodicity `nums[x]`.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to compute the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities encountered so far. This ensures that we account for the sequential waiting period for each sign. Here's how we can modify the program to achieve this:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 1
        for x in range(n):
            start_year = lcm(start_year, nums[x])
        print(start_year)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `num_tests`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `nums`.

3. **Calculating the Year for the Next Sign:**
   - It initializes `start_year` to 1, which represents the first year.
   - It then iterates through each periodicity `nums[x]` and updates `start_year` to the least common multiple (LCM) of `start_year` and `nums[x]`.

4. **Using LCM:**
   - The `lcm` function is defined to compute the least common multiple of two numbers using the greatest common divisor (GCD).
   - By updating `start_year` with the LCM of the current `start_year` and the current periodicity, we ensure that `start_year` represents the year when the next sign will occur, accounting for the sequential waiting period.

### Example Walkthrough:

Given the example input:
```
6
3 2 4 5 9 18
```

- **Initial `start_year` is 1.**
- **First Sign (Periodicity 3):**
  - `start_year` becomes 3 (LCM of 1 and 3).
- **Second Sign (Periodicity 2):**
  - `start_year` becomes 6 (LCM of 3 and 2).
- **Third Sign (Periodicity 4):**
  - `start_year` becomes 12 (LCM of 6 and 4).
- **Fourth Sign (Periodicity 5):**
  - `start_year` becomes 60 (LCM of 12 and 5).
- **Fifth Sign (Periodicity 9):**
  - `start_year` becomes 180 (LCM of 60 and 9).
- **Sixth Sign (Periodicity 18):**
  - `start_year` becomes 360 (LCM of 180 and 18).

However, since the problem states that the signs must occur strictly sequentially, we should update `start_year` to the next multiple of the current periodicity after the previous sign has occurred. Therefore, the correct sequence should be:

- **First Sign (Periodicity 3):**
  - `start_year` becomes 3 (the smallest multiple of 3 that is >= 0).
- **Second Sign (Periodicity 2):**
  - `start_year` becomes 4 (the smallest multiple of 2 that is >= 3).
- **Third Sign (Periodicity 4):**
  - `start_year` becomes 8 (the smallest multiple of 4 that is >= 4).
- **Fourth Sign (Periodicity 5):**
  - `start_year` becomes 10 (the smallest multiple of 5 that is >= 8).
- **Fifth Sign (Periodicity 9):**
  - `start_year` becomes 18 (the smallest multiple of 9 that is >= 10).
- **Sixth Sign (Periodicity 18):**
  - `start_year` becomes 36 (the smallest multiple of 18 that is >= 18).

### Conclusion:

The original program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the year when the nth sign will occur. The corrected program uses the LCM to ensure the sequential waiting period is correctly accounted for.
