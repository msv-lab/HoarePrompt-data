Output State: **`num_tests` is an input integer - 1, and 0 â‰¤ `num_tests` â‰¤ 999, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `start_year` is 0.**

The code initializes `start_year` to 0. This does not affect the values of `num_tests`, `n`, or `nums`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
