Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `num_tests`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   
2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `nums`.
   - It initializes `start_year` to 0, which will be used to track the year when the last sign occurred.

3. **Calculating the Year for the Next Sign:**
   - The program uses a loop to iterate through each periodicity `x` in `nums`.
   - Inside the loop, it updates `start_year` using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.

### Reasoning:

- **Formula Explanation:**
  - The formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is intended to find the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year`.
  - However, this formula does not correctly handle the sequential waiting period as described in the problem statement.

- **Correct Approach:**
  - To correctly determine the year when the next sign will occur, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of all the periodicities up to the current point.
  - The LCM ensures that we account for the sequential waiting period for each sign.

### Example Walkthrough:

Given the example input:
```
6
3 2 4 5 9 18
```

- **Initial Year (`start_year`) is 0.**
- **First Sign (Periodicity 3):**
  - `start_year` becomes 3 (the smallest multiple of 3 that is >= 0).
- **Second Sign (Periodicity 2):**
  - `start_year` becomes 4 (the smallest multiple of 2 that is >= 3).
- **Third Sign (Periodicity 4):**
  - `start_year` becomes 8 (the smallest multiple of 4 that is >= 4).
- **Fourth Sign (Periodicity 5):**
  - `start_year` becomes 10 (the smallest multiple of 5 that is >= 8).
- **Fifth Sign (Periodicity 9):**
  - `start_year` becomes 18 (the smallest multiple of 9 that is >= 10).
- **Sixth Sign (Periodicity 18):**
  - `start_year` becomes 36 (the smallest multiple of 18 that is >= 18).

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the year when the nth sign will occur. It uses a formula that does not account for the sequential waiting period properly.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
