Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t`, a positive integer `n`, and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". For each test case, it counts the number of 'U's in the string `s`. If the count of 'U's is odd, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, it outputs the total number of test cases processed (`t`), the last integer `n` read, the last string `s` read, and the count of 'U's in the last string `s`.**
