Reasoning:

1. **Function Call**: The program starts by calling `func_1()`, which reads the input and processes the test cases.
2. **Input Reading**: The function reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list `data`. This approach is efficient for handling multiple test cases.
3. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The function iterates through each test case, extracting `n` (number of coins) and `s` (the string representing the initial state of the coins).
4. **Counting 'U'**: For each test case, it counts the number of 'U's in the string `s`.
5. **Winning Condition**: If the count of 'U's is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.
6. **Output**: The function prints "YES" if Alice wins and "NO" if Bob wins for each test case.
7. **Final State**: After processing all test cases, the final values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `index`, and `count_u` are consistent with the expected behavior.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the count of 'U's. Since the logic is sound and the implementation matches the requirements, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
