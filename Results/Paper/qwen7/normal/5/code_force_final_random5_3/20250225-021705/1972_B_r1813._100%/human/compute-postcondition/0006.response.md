Output State: **`data` is a list with at least one positive integer as its first element, `n` is the integer at index 1 of `data`, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `index` is 2, `s` is now the string at index 3 of `data`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value at index `index + 1` (which is index 3) of the `data` list to the variable `s`. Since `index` was initially 2, `s` now holds the value at index 3 of the `data` list. All other variables remain unchanged.
