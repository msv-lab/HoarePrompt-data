Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `_` (which is a dummy variable) and `t`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute `t` times. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` must be greater than 0.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - The variable `t` must be decremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop.
   - Since the loop is controlled by `t`, the new value of `t` should be `t - 1`.

Given the initial state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `data` is a list with at least one positive integer as its first element.
- `n` is the integer at index 4 of `data`.
- `s` is the string at index 5 of `data`.
- `index` is 6.
- `count_u` is the number of 'U's in the string `s`.
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an integer.
- `count_u` is updated to the number of 'U's in the string `s`. If `count_u` is odd, no changes are made to `count_u`. If `count_u` is even, no changes are made to `count_u`.

Since the only variable in the loop head is `t`, and it must be decremented by 1 for the loop to execute again, the new state of `t` will be `t - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`data` is a list with at least one positive integer as its first element, `n` is the integer at index 4 of `data`, `s` is the string at index 5 of `data`, `index` is 6, `count_u` is the number of 'U's in the string `s`, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `count_u` is updated to the number of 'U's in the string `s`. If `count_u` is odd, no changes are made to `count_u`. If `count_u` is even, no changes are made to `count_u`.**
