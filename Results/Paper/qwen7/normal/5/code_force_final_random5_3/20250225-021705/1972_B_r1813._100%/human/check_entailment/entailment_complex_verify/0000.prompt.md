You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and s is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D" representing the initial state of the coins.

    #State: Output State: The list `data` contains at least one positive integer as its first element, `t` is an integer representing the total number of iterations that have been executed, `n` is the integer at index `2 * t + 1` of `data`, `s` is the string at index `2 * t + 2` of `data`, `index` is `2 * t + 3`, `count_u` is the number of 'U's in the string `s`. After all iterations, `t` will be the total number of iterations executed, which is equal to the initial value of `t` from the first iteration. `n` will be the last integer processed, and `s` will be the last string processed. `index` will be `2 * t + 3`, indicating the position right after the last string processed. `count_u` will be the number of 'U's in the last processed string `s`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after all iterations, `t` will be the total number of times the loop has run, `n` will be the last integer read from `data`, `s` will be the last string read from `data`, `index` will point to the position right after the last string, and `count_u` will be the number of 'U's in the last string `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t`, a positive integer `n`, and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". For each test case, it counts the number of 'U's in the string `s`. If the count of 'U's is odd, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, it outputs the total number of test cases processed (`t`), the last integer `n` read, the last string `s` read, and the count of 'U's in the last string `s`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly simulate the game as described. Specifically, the program does not handle the removal and flipping of coins properly. According to the problem description, when a facing-up coin is chosen, the two adjacent coins are flipped. However, the provided code simply counts the number of 'U' characters in the string and determines the winner based on whether this count is odd or even. This approach does not simulate the game mechanics accurately.

For example, consider the input:

```
5
UUDUD
```

The expected output should be "YES" because Alice can choose the first coin, resulting in "DDUU". Then Bob has to choose a coin, but since there are no more facing-up coins, he loses. However, the current implementation will incorrectly output "NO" because it only checks the count of 'U' characters and does not simulate the game steps.

To correctly implement the game, the program needs to simulate the removal and flipping process for each move, which is not done in the current implementation.
