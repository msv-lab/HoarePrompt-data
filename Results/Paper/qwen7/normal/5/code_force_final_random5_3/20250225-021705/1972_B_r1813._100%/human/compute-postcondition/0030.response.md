Postcondition: **`data` is a list with at least one positive integer as its first element, `n` is the integer at index 4 of `data`, `s` is the string at index 6 of `data`, `index` is 8, `count_u` is the number of 'U's in the string `s`, `t` is greater than 1, and `count_u` is updated to the number of 'U's in the string `s`. If `count_u` is odd, `s` remains unchanged. If `count_u` is even, `s` is reassigned to the string at index 7 of `data`.**
