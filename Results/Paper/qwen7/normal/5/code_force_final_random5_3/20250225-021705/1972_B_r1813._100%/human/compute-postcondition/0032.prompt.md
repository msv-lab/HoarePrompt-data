Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer equal to the first element in `data`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `index` is 1
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    s = data[index + 1]
    index += 2
    count_u = s.count('U')
    if count_u % 2 == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `data` is a list with at least one positive integer as its first element, `n` is the integer at index 1 of `data`, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `index` is 4, `count_u` is the number of 'U's in the string `s`. If the count of 'U's in `s` is odd, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. If the count of 'U's in `s` is even, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `data` is a list with at least one positive integer as its first element, `n` is the integer at index 4 of `data`, `s` is the string at index 5 of `data`, `index` is 6, `count_u` is the number of 'U's in the string `s`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `count_u` is updated to the number of 'U's in the string `s`. If `count_u` is odd, no changes are made to `count_u`. If `count_u` is even, no changes are made to `count_u`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `data` is a list with at least one positive integer as its first element, `n` is the integer at index 4 of `data`, `s` is the string at index 6 of `data`, `index` is 8, `count_u` is the number of 'U's in the string `s`, `t` is greater than 1, and `count_u` is updated to the number of 'U's in the string `s`. If `count_u` is odd, `s` remains unchanged. If `count_u` is even, `s` is reassigned to the string at index 7 of `data`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
