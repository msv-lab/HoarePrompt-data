Based on the initial state provided:

- `data` is a list with at least one positive integer as its first element.
- `n` is the integer at index 4 of `data`.
- `s` is the string at index 5 of `data`.
- `index` is 6.
- `count_u` is the number of 'U's in the string `s`.
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an integer.
- `count_u` is updated to the number of 'U's in the string `s`.

The `print('YES')` statement simply prints the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
