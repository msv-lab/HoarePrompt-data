Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `cur` is an index in the list `N`.
- `M[cur]` is incremented by 1 if `num > cur` or `num <= cur + 1`.
- If `num > cur`, `cur` is increased by 1.
- If `num > cur - 1` or `num <= cur`, `M[cur-1]` is incremented by 1 and `M[cur]` is set to 1.
- Otherwise, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1 and `cur` remains unchanged if `num > cur` or `num <= cur + 1`.

### Loop Head:
```
for num in N:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `num`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list `N`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Determine the Next `num`**:
   - Since `num` is taken from the list `N`, the next value of `num` will be the next element in the list `N`.

2. **Adjust the State**:
   - The state of `cur` and `M` will remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration because the loop has not yet executed this iteration.
   - The only thing that changes is the value of `num` which will be the next element in the list `N`.

### Final State:
- `cur` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `M[cur]` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `num` will be the next element in the list `N`.

### Conclusion:
State: **`cur` is an index in the list `N`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1 if `num > cur` or `num <= cur + 1`, `num` is the next element in the list `N`.**

So, the final state is:
State: **`cur` is an index in the list `N`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1 if `num > cur` or `num <= cur + 1`, `num` is the next element in the list `N`.**
