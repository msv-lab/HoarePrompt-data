Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop is iterating over the keys of the dictionary `M`. Therefore, the objects involved in the loop head are `k` (the loop variable) and `M` (the dictionary).

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `M` is a dictionary where the keys are values of `cur` at the point when it was last updated, and for each key, the value is the count of numbers in `N` that are either equal to the key or fall within the range `[cur - 1, cur]`.
   - `k` will take on each key of the dictionary `M` during the loop iterations.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, the dictionary `M` must have at least one key. If `M` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since the loop depends on the existence of at least one key in the dictionary `M`, we need to ensure that `M` is not empty.
   - The value of `k` will be one of the keys in `M` during the first iteration, but we don't need to specify its exact value since the loop will iterate over all keys.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is the dictionary `M` to ensure it is not empty.

**State:**
**`M` must have at least one key.**
