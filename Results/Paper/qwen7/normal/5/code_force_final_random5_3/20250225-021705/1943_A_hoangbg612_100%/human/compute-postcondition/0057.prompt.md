Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cur` will be the highest value in the list `N` that satisfies the condition `num > cur - 1`, the dictionary `M` will have entries where the key is the value of `cur` at the point when it was last updated, and for each key, the value is the count of numbers in `N` that are either equal to the key or fall within the range `[cur - 1, cur]`, the sum of all values in the dictionary `M` is equal to `S`, `cnt` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for k in M.keys():
    if M[k] == 1:
        cnt.append(k)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: M[k] is equal to 1, and cnt contains k.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `M[k]` is equal to 1, and `cnt` now contains the next key in `M` that satisfies `M[k] == 1` and also includes the key `k`, regardless of the outcome of the if condition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `M[k]` is no longer 1, `cnt` now contains the value of `k` appended to it, and `cnt` is the next key in `M` that satisfies `M[k] == 1` and includes the key `k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
