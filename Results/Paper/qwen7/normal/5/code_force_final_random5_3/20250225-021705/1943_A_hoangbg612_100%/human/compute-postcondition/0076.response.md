Output State: **`N` is a non-empty list, `cur` is equal to `num`, and either `num` is greater than `cur + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or `num` is not greater than `cur + 1`.**

The variable `cur` is assigned the value of `num`. The conditions regarding `num` and the break statement remain unchanged.
