Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `num` and `N`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `N`. 

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `N` is a non-empty list.
   - `cur` is the next element in the list `N`.
   - `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.
   - If `num` (the next element in `N`) is greater than `cur + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken; otherwise, `num` is less than or equal to the current maximum element in the list `N`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `num` is the next element in the list `N`, it means that `num` was the current element in the previous iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `num` must be the next element in the list `N`.
   - `N` should now contain one fewer element because `num` has been processed.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `N` should now be a list containing all elements except the one that was just processed (which is `num`).
- `cur` should be the next element in this updated list `N`.
- `M[cur]` should be incremented by 1.
- The condition for breaking the internal loop or if statement should be checked with the new `num`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`N` is a list containing all elements except the one that was just processed (which is `num`), `cur` is the next element in this updated list `N`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1, and if `num` (the next element in `N`) is greater than `cur + 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken; otherwise, `num` is less than or equal to the current maximum element in the list `N`.**
