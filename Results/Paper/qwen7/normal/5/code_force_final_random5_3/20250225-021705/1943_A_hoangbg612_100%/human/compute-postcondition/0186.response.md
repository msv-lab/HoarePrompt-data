Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t`, another positive integer `n`, and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers. It returns a result based on the conditions specified for each test case.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing a positive integer `t`, a positive integer `n`, and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers. The function then evaluates these inputs according to the given constraints and returns a result for each test case.
