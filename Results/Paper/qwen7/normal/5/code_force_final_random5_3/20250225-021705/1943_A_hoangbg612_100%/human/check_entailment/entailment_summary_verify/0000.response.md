### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem description and the function summary.

#### Problem Description Analysis:
- Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
- Alice starts by appending an element from `a` to her array `c` and deleting it from `a`.
- Bob then picks an element from `a` and deletes it.
- The game continues until `a` is empty.
- The final score is the MEX of `c`.
- Both players play optimally.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function processes multiple test cases.
- It sorts the list `a`.
- It counts the occurrences of each unique number.
- It identifies numbers that appear exactly once.
- If there are at least two such numbers, it selects the second smallest one; otherwise, it selects -1.
- Finally, it prints the selected number for each test case and sets `T` to 0.

#### Program Code Analysis:
```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        N.sort()
        cur = -1
        M = {}
        for num in N:
            if num > cur:
                if num > cur + 1:
                    cur += 1
                    break
                cur = num
                M[cur] = 1
            else:
                M[cur] += 1
        if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S:
            cur += 1
        cnt = []
        for k in M.keys():
            if M[k] == 1:
                cnt.append(k)
        if len(cnt) >= 2:
            cur = cnt[1]
        print(cur)
        T = 0  # This line is redundant and should be removed
```

#### Key Issues:
1. **Sorting and Counting**: The program sorts the array `N` and counts the occurrences of each unique number. However, this does not simulate the game turns taken by Alice and Bob.
2. **MEX Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate the MEX by identifying numbers that appear exactly once. This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the game's turn-based nature and the optimal strategy of both players.
3. **Optimal Strategy**: The program does not simulate the game to determine the optimal moves for Alice and Bob. Instead, it tries to find a pattern in the sorted array, which is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the game rules and logic. It does not simulate the turns taken by Alice and Bob and does not properly compute the MEX of the final array `c` based on the optimal strategy for both players.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the game rules and logic.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
