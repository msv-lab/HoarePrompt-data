Postcondition: **`T` must be greater than 0, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is either `cur` or `num` and the value is 1, `cnt` contains all keys from the original dictionary `M` where the value was 1, `cur` is `num` if `num > cur`, otherwise `cur` is -1, and `N` is a non-empty list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces with one less element than before.**
