Output State: **After all iterations of the loop have finished, the dictionary `M` will no longer contain any keys with a value of 1, the list `cnt` will contain all the keys from the dictionary `M` that satisfied the condition `M[k] == 1` during the loop's execution, and the length of the list `cnt` is at least 2; the variable `cur` is equal to the second element in the list `cnt`.**

This means that after the loop has completed, the dictionary `M` no longer contains any keys with a value of 1, and the list `cnt` contains all the keys from `M` that had a value of 1. Furthermore, `cur` is set to the second element in the list `cnt`.
