Output State: **`N` is a list containing all elements except the one that was just processed (which is `num`), `cur` is the next element in this updated list `N`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `M[cur]` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The list `N` and the variable `cur` are still as described in the initial state, and the condition for breaking the loop based on the comparison between `num` and `cur + 1` is not directly impacted by this line of code.
