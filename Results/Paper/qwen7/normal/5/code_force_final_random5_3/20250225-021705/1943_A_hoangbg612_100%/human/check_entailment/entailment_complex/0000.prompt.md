Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and a is a list of n non-negative integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        N.sort()
        
        cur = -1
        
        M = {}
        
        for num in N:
            if num > cur:
                if num > cur + 1:
                    cur += 1
                    break
                cur = num
                M[cur] = 1
            else:
                M[cur] += 1
        
        if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S:
            cur += 1
        
        cnt = []
        
        for k in M.keys():
            if M[k] == 1:
                cnt.append(k)
        
        if len(cnt) >= 2:
            cur = cnt[1]
        
        print(cur)
        
    #State: Output State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the dictionary `M` will be empty, as all entries with a value of 1 will have been processed. The list `cnt` will contain all unique keys from the original dictionary `M` that had a value of 1 during the loop's execution. The variable `cur` will be set to the second smallest key in the list `cnt` if the list has at least two elements; otherwise, `cur` will be -1 (or undefined, depending on how the code handles an empty `cnt` list). The variable `T` will be 0, indicating that all input integers have been processed.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after running the loop through all iterations, `M` will be empty because all its entries with a count of 1 will have been removed. `cnt` will hold all the unique keys that appeared exactly once in any of the input lists `N`. `cur` will be the second smallest number in `cnt` if `cnt` has more than one element; otherwise, `cur` will be undefined or -1. Also, `T` will be 0, showing that there are no more inputs to process.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t`, another positive integer `n`, and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers. For each test case, it sorts the list `a`, counts the occurrences of each unique number, and identifies numbers that appear exactly once. If there are at least two such numbers, it selects the second smallest one; otherwise, it selects -1. Finally, it prints the selected number for each test case and sets the variable `T` to 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
