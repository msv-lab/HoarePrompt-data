Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `M` is an empty dictionary, `cnt` contains all keys from the original dictionary `M` where the value was 1, `cur` is `num`.**

The code `cur = num` assigns the value of `num` to `cur`. Since the initial state does not specify a particular value for `num`, `cur` is simply updated to be equal to `num`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
