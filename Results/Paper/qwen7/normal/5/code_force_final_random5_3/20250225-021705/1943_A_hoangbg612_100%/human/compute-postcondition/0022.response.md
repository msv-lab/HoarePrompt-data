Output State: **`cur` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `M[cur-1]` is incremented by 1 if `num > cur-1` or `num <= cur`, if `num > cur` then `cur` is increased by 1, `N` must contain at least one element, and `num` will be the next element in `N`.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional structure that was checking the conditions related to `cur`, `M[cur-1]`, and `num`. The values of `cur` and `M[cur-1]` might have been updated before the `break` statement, but since the exact values are not specified, we keep the conditions as they are. The other variables (`N` and `num`) remain unaffected by the `break` statement.
