Output State: **`S` is an input integer, `M` is an empty dictionary, `cnt` contains all the keys from the dictionary `M` that satisfied the condition `M[k] == 1` during the loop's execution (which is now an empty set since `M` is empty), the length of the list `cnt` is 0, and `cur` is equal to -1, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty dictionary `M`. This operation does not affect the values of `S`, `cnt`, `cur`, or `N`. Since `M` is now empty, `cnt` also becomes an empty set because it contained the keys from `M` that satisfied the condition `M[k] == 1`. The length of `cnt` is updated to 0.
