Output State: **`cur` is incremented by 1**.

The value of `cur` is incremented by 1, while the other conditions and the value of `M[cur]` remain unchanged from the initial state. The condition `M[cur]` is incremented by 1 if `num > cur` or `num <= cur + 1` is still valid but will be checked with the new value of `cur`. The value of `num` is also the next element in the list `N`, which means it will be updated to the next element after the increment of `cur`. However, since the question only asks for the output state after the given code is executed and focuses on the variables that have been directly affected, the output state is simply that `cur` is incremented by 1.
