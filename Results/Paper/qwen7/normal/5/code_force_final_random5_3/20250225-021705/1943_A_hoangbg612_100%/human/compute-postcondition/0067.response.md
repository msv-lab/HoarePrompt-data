Output State: **`S` is an input integer, `M` no longer contains any keys with a value of 1, `cnt` contains all the keys from the dictionary `M` that satisfied the condition `M[k] == 1` during the loop's execution, the length of the list `cnt` is at least 2, and `cur` is equal to -1, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained by splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The line `cur = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the variable `cur`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
