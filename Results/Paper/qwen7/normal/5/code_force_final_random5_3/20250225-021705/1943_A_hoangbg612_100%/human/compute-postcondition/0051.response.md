Output State: **`M[k]` is equal to 1; `cnt` now contains the next key in `M` that satisfies `M[k] == 1` and also includes the key `k`.**

Explanation: The code appends the key `k` to the list `cnt`. Since `M[k]` was initially equal to 1 and `cnt` contained the next key in `M` that satisfies `M[k] == 1`, after executing `cnt.append(k)`, `cnt` now includes both the original key and the newly appended key `k`.
