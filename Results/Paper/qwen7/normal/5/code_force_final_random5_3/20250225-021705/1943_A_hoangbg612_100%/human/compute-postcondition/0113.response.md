The only objects in the loop head are the variables `k` and `M`. Therefore, we can only adjust those ones.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the keys in the dictionary `M`. The loop iterates over each key in `M.keys()`. At the end of the last iteration, `M` must have at least one key. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `M` must have at least two keys. This ensures that there is another key to iterate over in the next iteration of the loop.

State: **`M` must have at least two keys**
