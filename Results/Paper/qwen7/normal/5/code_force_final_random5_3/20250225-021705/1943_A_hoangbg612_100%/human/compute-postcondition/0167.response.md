Output State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key, `cnt` is a list containing the key `k`, `cur` is the last integer processed in the list `N`, and `N` is an empty list since all elements have been processed.**

In this output state, the dictionary `M` retains its original condition of having at least one key, and the value of that key remains 1. The list `cnt` now contains the key `k` that was appended. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
