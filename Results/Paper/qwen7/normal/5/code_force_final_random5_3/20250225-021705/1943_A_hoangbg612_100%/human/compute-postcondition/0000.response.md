Output State: **T is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4.**

The code `T = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `T`. Since the initial state specified that `t` (which we can assume is the same as `T` in this context) is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), the value of `T` will also be within this range. The other conditions and lists mentioned in the initial state remain unchanged and are still valid.
