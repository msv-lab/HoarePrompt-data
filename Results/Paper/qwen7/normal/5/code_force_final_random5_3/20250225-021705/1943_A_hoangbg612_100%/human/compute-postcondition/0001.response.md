Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (a common placeholder for an unused variable) and the variable `T`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `T` is greater than 0. Since `T` is given as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), the loop will definitely execute at least once.

3. **Adjust the States**: The only state that needs to be adjusted is `T`, ensuring it is within the specified range and greater than 0. Since `T` is already described as a positive integer, it meets the condition for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the state before the loop starts should include the fact that `T` is a positive integer within the specified range.

**State: **`T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\)**
