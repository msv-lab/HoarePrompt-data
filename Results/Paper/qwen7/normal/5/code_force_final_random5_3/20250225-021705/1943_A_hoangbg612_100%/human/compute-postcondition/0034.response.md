Output State: **`cur` is equal to `num`; `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code sets `cur` to the value of `num`. If `num > cur + 1` was true before this line, the conditions for incrementing `M[cur]` and `cur` by 1 would no longer apply because `cur` is now equal to `num`. If `num <= cur + 1` was true before this line, then `M[cur]` is incremented by 1. In both cases, the only change is that `cur` is now equal to `num`.
