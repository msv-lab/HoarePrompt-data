Output State: **`cur` is an index in the list `N`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1, `num` is the next element in the list `N`.**

Explanation: The code `M[cur] += 1` increments the value of `M[cur]` by 1. The initial conditions state that `cur` is an index in the list `N`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1 if `num > cur` or `num <= cur + 1`, and `num` is the next element in the list `N`. After executing the code, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1, and the other variables remain in their initial conditions.
