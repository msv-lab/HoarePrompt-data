Output State: **`M[cur]` is incremented by 1, `N` must contain at least one element, and the number `num` is less than or equal to the current element `cur` in the list.**

Explanation: The code `M[cur] += 1` increments the value of `M[cur]` by 1. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `N` must still contain at least one element, and `num` must still be less than or equal to the current element `cur` in the list.
