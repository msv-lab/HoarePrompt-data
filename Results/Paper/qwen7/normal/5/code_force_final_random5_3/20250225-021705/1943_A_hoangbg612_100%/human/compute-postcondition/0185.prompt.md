Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    S = int(input())
    N = list(map(int, input().split()))
    N.sort()
    cur = -1
    M = {}
    for num in N:
        if num > cur:
            if num > cur + 1:
                cur += 1
                break
            cur = num
            M[cur] = 1
        else:
            M[cur] += 1
    if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S:
        cur += 1
    cnt = []
    for k in M.keys():
        if M[k] == 1:
            cnt.append(k)
    if len(cnt) >= 2:
        cur = cnt[1]
    print(cur)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the dictionary `M` will no longer contain any keys with a value of 1, the list `cnt` will contain all the keys from the dictionary `M` that satisfied the condition `M[k] == 1` during the loop's execution, and the length of the list `cnt` is at least 2; the variable `cur` is equal to the second element in the list `cnt`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The dictionary M is empty, and the list cnt contains all keys from the original dictionary M where the value was 1. If the length of cnt is greater than or equal to 2, then cur is equal to the second element in the list cnt.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `T` must be greater than 0, `M` is an empty dictionary, `cnt` is a list containing all unique keys from the original dictionary `M` that had a value of 1, and `N` is an empty list since all elements have been processed. If the length of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, then `cur` is the second element in the list `cnt`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
