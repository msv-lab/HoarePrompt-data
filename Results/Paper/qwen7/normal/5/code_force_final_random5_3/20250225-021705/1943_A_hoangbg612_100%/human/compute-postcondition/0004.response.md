Output State: **`T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input on spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `N.sort()` sorts the list `N` in ascending order. The values of `T` and `S` remain unchanged. The list `N` is updated to be its sorted version.
