Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly implements the decoding process as described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and the correctness of the implementation:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings. It then iterates over the test cases, extracting the necessary information (length of the encoded string and the encoded string itself).

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`)**:
   - **Step 1**: Extracts all unique characters from the encoded string and sorts them alphabetically.
   - **Step 2**: Creates a dictionary (`char_map`) that maps each unique character to its corresponding character from the end of the sorted list of unique characters.
   - **Step 3**: Constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in the encoded string with its corresponding character from the `char_map`.

The logic within the `func_1` function is sound and correctly implements the required decoding process. The state transitions and the final output are consistent with the problem description.

Given that the program correctly processes each test case and produces the expected decoded strings, the overall implementation is correct.

Correctness: **True**
