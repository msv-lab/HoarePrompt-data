Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `unique_chars` is a list of the sorted unique characters from `encoded`; `char_map` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary named `char_map`. This dictionary will be used to map each unique character from the `encoded` string to some value, but no mappings have been defined yet. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
