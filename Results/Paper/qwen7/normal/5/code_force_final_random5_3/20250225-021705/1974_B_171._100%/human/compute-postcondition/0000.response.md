Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `unique_chars` is a list of the sorted unique characters from `encoded`.**

Explanation: The code `unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))` creates a set from the string `encoded` to remove duplicate characters and then sorts these unique characters alphabetically. The set operation does not preserve the order of characters, but the sorting operation ensures that the characters in `unique_chars` are in alphabetical order. The length of `encoded` remains unchanged, and the condition on its length (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) is still valid.
