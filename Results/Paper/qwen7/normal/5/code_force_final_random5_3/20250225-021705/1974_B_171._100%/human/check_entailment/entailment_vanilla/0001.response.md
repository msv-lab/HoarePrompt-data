Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly decodes the encoded string according to the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into parts.
   - It then iterates through the test cases, extracting the necessary information (`n` and `encoded string`) for each case.

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`):**
   - **Extracting Unique Characters:**
     - `unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))`: This correctly extracts and sorts the unique characters from the encoded string.
   - **Creating the Character Mapping:**
     - `char_map = {}`: Initializes an empty dictionary.
     - `for i in range(len_unique): char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]`: This loop correctly pairs each character with its symmetric counterpart.
   - **Decoding the String:**
     - `decoded = ''.join((char_map[ch] for ch in encoded))`: This joins the decoded characters to form the original string.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The program processes each test case separately and stores the decoded strings in a list.
   - Finally, it prints each decoded string.

### Verification:

To verify the correctness, let's check if the logic matches the problem statement:

- **Unique Characters Extraction:** Correctly identifies and sorts unique characters.
- **Character Mapping:** Correctly maps each character to its symmetric counterpart.
- **Decoding Process:** Correctly reconstructs the original string from the encoded string using the mapping.

Given the analysis, the provided program appears to follow the correct steps and logic for decoding the string.

### Conclusion:

Based on the step-by-step analysis, the program correctly implements the decoding process as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: **True**
