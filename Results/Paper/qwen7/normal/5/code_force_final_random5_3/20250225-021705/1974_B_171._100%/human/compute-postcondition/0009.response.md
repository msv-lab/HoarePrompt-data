Output State: `len_unique` must be greater than 0; `i` is equal to `len_unique`; for every `j` in `range(len_unique)`, `char_map[unique_chars[j]]` is assigned the value of `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - j]`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `len_unique` will still be greater than 0 (as long as it was initially), `i` will be equal to `len_unique` (since the loop increments `i` until it reaches `len_unique`), and the dictionary `char_map` will map each character in `unique_chars` to its corresponding character from the end of the list. Specifically, the first character in `unique_chars` will map to the last character, the second character will map to the second-to-last character, and so on.
