### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to verify its correctness based on the given problem description and the function summary.

#### 1. Reading Input:
- The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits the data into a list of strings.
- It correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating through the list of test cases.

#### 2. Extracting Test Case Details:
- For each test case, it extracts the length of the encoded string (`n`) and the encoded string (`b`).

#### 3. Decoding Logic:
- **Unique Characters Extraction**: The program correctly identifies all unique characters in the encoded string and sorts them alphabetically.
- **Mapping Characters**: It creates a mapping where each character is replaced by its symmetric counterpart from the sorted list of unique characters.
- **Decoding**: The program uses this mapping to decode the entire encoded string.

#### 4. Edge Cases:
- The program should handle edge cases such as single-character strings and strings with repeated characters correctly.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function `func_1` correctly maps each character in the encoded string to its symmetric counterpart in the sorted list of unique characters.
- The mapping ensures that the first character in the sorted list is mapped to the last character, the second character to the second-to-last, and so on.

#### Detailed Analysis:
- **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads and processes the input for multiple test cases.
- **Unique Character Extraction**: The use of `set(encoded)` and `sorted()` ensures that all unique characters are extracted and sorted correctly.
- **Character Mapping**: The loop `for i in range(len_unique):` correctly pairs each character with its symmetric counterpart.
- **Decoding**: The `decoded` string is constructed by replacing each character in the encoded string with its mapped value.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the decoding logic as described in the problem statement and the function summary. There are no apparent errors or edge cases that the program fails to handle.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program correctly decodes the encoded string according to the given problem description and handles all described scenarios without any issues. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
