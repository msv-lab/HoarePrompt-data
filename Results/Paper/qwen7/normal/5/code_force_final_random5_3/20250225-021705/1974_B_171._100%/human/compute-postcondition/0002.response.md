Output State: **`len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars`, `unique_chars` is a list of the sorted unique characters from `encoded`, and `char_map` is an empty dictionary.**

Explanation: The code calculates the length of the `unique_chars` list and assigns it to the variable `len_unique`. The length of `unique_chars` is stored in `len_unique`, while the other variables remain unchanged. The `unique_chars` list and `char_map` dictionary retain their initial states.
