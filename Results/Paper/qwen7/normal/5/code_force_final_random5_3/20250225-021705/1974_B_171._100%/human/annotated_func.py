#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The string encoded is the result of encoding some original string s according to the given algorithm.
def func_1(encoded):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    char_map = {}
    len_unique = len(unique_chars)
    for i in range(len_unique):
        char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]
        
    #State: Output State: `len_unique` is greater than 0; `i` is equal to `len_unique`; for every index `j` in `unique_chars`, `char_map[unique_chars[j]]` is assigned the value of `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - j]`.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `len_unique` will still be greater than 0 (as long as there were unique characters in `encoded` to begin with). The variable `i` will be equal to `len_unique` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches `len_unique`. The dictionary `char_map` will contain mappings for each character in `unique_chars` such that each character `unique_chars[j]` maps to `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - j]`. In other words, each character in `unique_chars` will map to its corresponding character from the end of the list, effectively creating a mirrored mapping.
    decoded = ''.join(char_map[ch] for ch in encoded)
    return decoded
    #The program returns a string `decoded` where each character is mapped according to the `char_map` dictionary. The mapping is such that for every index `j` in `unique_chars`, `char_map[unique_chars[j]]` is assigned the value of `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - j]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string `decoded`. Each character in `decoded` is mapped according to a dictionary `char_map`, where each unique character in `encoded` is paired with its corresponding character from the end of the unique character list. This results in a mirrored mapping of characters in the output string.
