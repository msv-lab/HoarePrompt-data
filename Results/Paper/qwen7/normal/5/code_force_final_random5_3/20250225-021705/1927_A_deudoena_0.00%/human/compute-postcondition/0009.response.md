Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `(i, j) in enumerate(inpstr)`. This means the loop variables are `i` and `j`.

2. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is a string.
   - If `j` is equal to 'B', then `ind1` is set to `i` and the loop breaks.
   - If `j` is not equal to 'B', there is no change in the state.

3. **Consider the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must not be equal to 'B' because if `j` is 'B', the loop would break.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `j` must not be 'B' for the loop to continue, we need to ensure that `j` is not 'B'.
   - The value of `i` does not change within the loop unless `j` is 'B', but since we are ensuring the loop continues, `i` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

5. **Final state**:
   - `j` must not be 'B'.
   - `i` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `j` is a string that is not equal to 'B', `i` is the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration**.
