Output State: **`j` is the next character in `inpstr`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ind1` is now equal to `i`**

Explanation: The code `ind1 = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `ind1`. Since `i` was already incremented by 1 in the initial state, `ind1` now holds the value of `i` after the increment. The value of `j` remains unchanged, and `i` is incremented by 1 as stated in the initial condition.
