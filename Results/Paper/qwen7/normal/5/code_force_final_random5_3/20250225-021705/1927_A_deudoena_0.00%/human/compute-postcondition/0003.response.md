Output State: **`ind1` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where at least one character in `s` is 'B', `ind2` is 0, `inpstr` is the input string from the user, `outind` is 0.**

The code simply initializes the variable `outind` to 0. No other changes are made to the existing variables or their values. Therefore, the values of `ind1`, `t`, `n`, `s`, `ind2`, and `inpstr` remain unchanged, and `outind` is set to 0.
