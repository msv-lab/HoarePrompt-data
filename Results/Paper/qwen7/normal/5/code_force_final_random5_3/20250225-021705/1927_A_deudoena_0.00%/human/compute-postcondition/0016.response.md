Output State: **`j` is the next character in `inpstr`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `ind1` is `i`.**

Explanation: The code `ind1 = i` simply assigns the current value of `i` to `ind1`. The values of `j` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `j` is still the next character in `inpstr`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `ind1` is now equal to `i`.
