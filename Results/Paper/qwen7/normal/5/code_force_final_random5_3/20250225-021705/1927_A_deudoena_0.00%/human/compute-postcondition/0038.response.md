Output State: **`i` is 3, `ind2` is 1.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to the length of `inpstr` minus one because the loop increments `i` until it finds 'B' or reaches the end of the string. Since the loop breaks when it finds 'B' at index `-i - 1`, `ind2` will be set to the value of `i` at that point. Given the conditions described, `ind2` is set to 1 when 'B' is found at index `-1 - 1`, which corresponds to the second last character of `inpstr`. Therefore, after all iterations, `i` will be 3 (length of `inpstr` - 1), and `ind2` will be 1.
