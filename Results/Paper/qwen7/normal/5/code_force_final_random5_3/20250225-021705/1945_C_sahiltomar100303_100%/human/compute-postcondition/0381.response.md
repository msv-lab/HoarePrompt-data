Output State: **After executing `left = mid`, `left` is equal to `mid`, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, and both `rightZero` and `rightOne` will be equal to the sum of `trightZero` and `trightOne` respectively.**

Explanation: The code `left = mid` simply assigns the value of `mid` to the variable `left`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `trightZero`, or `trightOne`. The loop's behavior and the final values of `rightZero` and `rightOne` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the assignment of `mid` to `left` while keeping the other variables in their previously described states.
