Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 2, `leftZero` must be less than `(n // 2 + 1) // 2`, `rightOne` is increased by 1, `leftOne` is decreased by 1, `s[left - 1]` is not '0'**.

Explanation: The code `rightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
