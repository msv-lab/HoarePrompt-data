Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, and both `rightZero` and `rightOne` will be equal to the sum of `trightZero` and `trightOne` respectively.

Explanation: The loop starts from `i = mid` and continues until `i < n`. For each iteration, if the character at index `i` in string `s` is '0', `rightZero` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `rightOne` is incremented by 1. Since the loop runs from `mid` to `n-1`, `i` will eventually reach `n-1` after all iterations. The final values of `rightZero` and `rightOne` will be the cumulative counts of zeros and ones from index `mid` to `n-1`, which are stored in `trightZero` and `trightOne` respectively.
