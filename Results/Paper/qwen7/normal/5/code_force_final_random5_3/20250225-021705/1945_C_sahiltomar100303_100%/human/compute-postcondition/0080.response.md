Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is greater than `mid`, `mid` must be greater than 1, `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the substring `s[mid:n]` plus 1 or remains the same, `rightOne` must be less than `(n - mid + 2) // 2`, `left` is `mid - 2`, `leftMove` is `0`, `leftZero` is `leftZero - 1`, `leftOne` is `leftOne - 1` (if `s[left - 1] != '0'`), and `leftZero` is less than `mid // 2`**

Explanation: The line `left -= 1` decrements the value of `left` by 1. Since `left` was initially `mid - 1`, after decrementing, it becomes `mid - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged based on the given initial state.
