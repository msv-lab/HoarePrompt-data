Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than `mid`, `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the substring `s[mid:n]` plus 1, `rightOne` must be less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2`, `left` is `mid`, `leftMove` is 0, `leftZero` is `leftZero - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `rightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
