Output State: **`i` is `0`, `n` is greater than `mid`, `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the substring `s[mid:n]` plus a value between 0 and 3, `rightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2` and has been incremented by up to 3 if `s[left - 1] == '0'`, `left` is `0`, `leftMove` is `0`, `leftZero` is `leftZero - 3` and is less than `mid // 2`, `right` is `mid`**.

Explanation: The code `right = mid` simply assigns the value of `mid` to the variable `right`. This does not affect any other variables. The conditions and values of `i`, `n`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `left`, `leftMove`, and `leftZero` remain unchanged from their previous states.
