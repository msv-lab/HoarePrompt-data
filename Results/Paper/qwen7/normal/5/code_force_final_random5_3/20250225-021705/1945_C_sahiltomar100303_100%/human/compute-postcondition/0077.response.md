Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than `mid` and `mid` must be greater than 1, `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the substring `s[mid:n]`, `rightOne` is now `rightOne + 1`, `left` is `mid - 1`, `leftMove` is `0`, `leftZero` is `leftZero - 1` (if `s[left - 1] == '0'`), `leftOne` is `leftOne - 1` (if `s[left - 1] != '0'`, and `leftZero` must be less than `mid // 2`, and `rightOne` must be less than `(n - mid + 2) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code `rightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
