Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `mid + (number of iterations)`. `rightZero` is equal to the number of '0's in the substring of `s` from index `mid` to `n-1`. `rightOne` is equal to the number of '1's in the same substring of `s`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has processed every element from `mid` to `n-1` in the string `s`. The variable `rightZero` will hold the count of '0's in the specified substring, and `rightOne` will hold the count of '1's in the same substring.
