Output State: **`i` is `mid`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `mid`, and the character at index `i` in string `s` is not '0'; `rightOne` is increased by 1.**

The code `rightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. Since `rightOne` was not previously defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be 0 before this line of code is executed. After executing the code, `rightOne` is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
