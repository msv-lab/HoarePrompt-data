Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is `trightZero + rightZero - k`, `rightZero` is `rightZero + k`, and `rightOne` is `rightOne + k`, `right` is `mid`.**

Explanation: The code `right = mid` simply assigns the value of `mid` to the variable `right`. This does not affect the values of `left`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, or `rightOne`. The value of `left` remains 0, and the expressions for `leftZero`, `rightZero`, and `rightOne` remain unchanged from their previous values. The only new information is that `right` is now set to `mid`.
