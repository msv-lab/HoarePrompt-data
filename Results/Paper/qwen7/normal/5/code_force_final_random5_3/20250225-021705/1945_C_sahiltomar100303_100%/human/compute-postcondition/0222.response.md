Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `mid` is `n // 2`, `rightZero` is the total count of '0's from index `mid` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is the total count of '1's from index `mid` to `n-1`, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `tleftZero` is the count of '0's from index `0` to `mid-1`, `tleftOne` is the count of '1's from index `0` to `mid-1`, `s` is the input string, `left` is `mid`**.

Explanation: The code `left = mid` simply assigns the value of `mid` to the variable `left`. This does not affect any other variables or their values. The value of `i` is set to `n` after the loop completes, but since the loop has not yet started, `i` remains as it was initialized. All other variables retain their previously defined values.
