Output State: **`tleftZero` is increased by 1, `t`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, `rightZero`, `trightOne`, `leftOne` retain their original properties, `i` is `i_current + 1`.**

This means that the variable `tleftZero` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, `rightZero`, `trightOne`, `leftOne`, and `i` remain unchanged from their original states. Specifically, `i` is now equal to `i_current + 1`.
