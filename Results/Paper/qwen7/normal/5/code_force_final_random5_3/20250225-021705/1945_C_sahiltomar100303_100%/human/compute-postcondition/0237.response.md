Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `n-2`, `leftZero` must be less than (left + 1) // 2, `rightZero` is `rightZero + 1`, and `rightOne` must be less than (n - left + 1) // 2**.

The code `rightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state and the given code snippet.
