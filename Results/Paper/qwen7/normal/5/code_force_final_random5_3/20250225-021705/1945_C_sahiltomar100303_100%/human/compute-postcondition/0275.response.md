Output State: **`s` is a string, `right` is an index within the string `s` plus 3, `tleftZero` is increased by 1 if `s[right-1]` was '0', otherwise it is decreased by 1; `trightZero` is decreased by 1 if `s[right-1]` was '0', otherwise it remains unchanged; `trightOne` is decreased by 1 if `s[right-1]` was not '0', otherwise it remains unchanged; `tleftOne` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `tleftOne += 1` increments the value of `tleftOne` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to their previous conditions.
