Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `mid`, `n` is an input integer, `mid` is `n // 2`, `rightZero` is 2, the current value of `s[i]` is '0'**.

Explanation: The variable `trightZero` is renamed to `rightZero` and its value is incremented by 1. Initially, `rightZero` was 1, so after executing `rightZero += 1`, its value becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
