Output State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than `mid`, `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the substring `s[mid:n]`, `rightOne` is the count of '1's in the same substring, `left` is `mid`**.

This means that the variable `left` has been assigned the value of `mid`, while the values of `i`, `n`, `mid`, `rightZero`, and `rightOne` remain as described in the initial state.
