Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is greater than `mid`, `mid` must be greater than 1, `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the substring `s[mid:n]` plus 1 or remains the same, `rightOne` must be less than `(n - mid + 2) // 2`, `left` is `mid - 2`, `leftMove` is `0`, `leftZero` is `leftZero - 1`, and `leftZero` is less than `mid // 2`**

Explanation: The code `leftZero -= 1` decrements the value of `leftZero` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the updated value of `leftZero` is one less than its original value, while all other variables retain their initial conditions.
