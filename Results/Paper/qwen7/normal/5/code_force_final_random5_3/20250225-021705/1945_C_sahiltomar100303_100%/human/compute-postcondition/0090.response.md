Output State: `i` is `0`, `n` is greater than `mid`, `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the substring `s[mid:n]` plus a value between 0 and 3, `rightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2` and has been incremented by up to 3 if `s[left - 1] == '0'`, `left` is `0`, `leftMove` is `0`, `leftZero` is `leftZero - 3` and is less than `mid // 2`.

This output state describes the final conditions after the loop has executed all its iterations. The variable `i` is reduced to `0` as the loop continues decrementing `left` until it reaches `0`. The counts of `rightZero` and `rightOne` will have been adjusted based on the characters encountered during each iteration of the loop. The `left` variable will also reach `0`, and `leftZero` will be decremented by the number of iterations, which is at most 3 in this case, and will be less than `mid // 2`.
