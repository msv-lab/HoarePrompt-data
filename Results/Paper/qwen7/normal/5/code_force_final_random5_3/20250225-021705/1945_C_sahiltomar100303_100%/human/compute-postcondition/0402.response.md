Output State: **`left` is `mid - 3`, `leftZero` is either `trightZero + rightZero - 1` or `trightZero + rightZero`, `rightZero` is either `rightZero + 1` or `rightZero`, and `rightOne` is either `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` or `(n - left + 1) // 2 + 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `left` is decremented by 1. The values of `leftZero`, `rightZero`, and `rightOne` remain unchanged from their previous conditions. The value of `left` is updated to `mid - 3` since it was initially `mid - 2`.
