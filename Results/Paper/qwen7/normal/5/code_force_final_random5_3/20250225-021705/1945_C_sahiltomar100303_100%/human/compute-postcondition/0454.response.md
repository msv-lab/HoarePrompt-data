Postcondition: `right` is equal to `n`, `left` remains 0, `tleftZero` is less than or equal to `n // 2`, `trightZero` is greater than or equal to 0, `trightOne` is less than or equal to `n // 2`, `tleftOne` is greater than or equal to 0, and the condition `left == 0` is true. If `right != n`, the postcondition remains unchanged. If `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, the postcondition also remains unchanged. Otherwise, `rightOne` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`.
