Output State: **`left` is `mid - 3`, `leftZero` is either `trightZero + rightZero - 2` or `trightZero + rightZero - 1`, `rightZero` is either `rightZero + 1` or `rightZero`, and `rightOne` is either `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` or `(n - left + 1) // 2 + 1` and must be less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state of `leftZero` is either `trightZero + rightZero - 1` or `trightZero + rightZero`, and it must be less than `(left + 1) // 2`.
- After executing `leftZero -= 1`, `leftZero` is decreased by 1. So, if `leftZero` was initially `trightZero + rightZero - 1`, it becomes `trightZero + rightZero - 2`. If it was `trightZero + rightZero`, it becomes `trightZero + rightZero - 1`.
- The other variables (`left`, `rightZero`, and `rightOne`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.
