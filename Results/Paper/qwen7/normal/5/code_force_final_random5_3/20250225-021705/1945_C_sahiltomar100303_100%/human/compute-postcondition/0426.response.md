Output State: **`right` is `mid + 1`, `n` remains unchanged, `tleftZero` is increased by 1, `trightZero` is decreased by 1, `trightOne` must be less than \(\frac{n - mid}{2} + 1\), `tleftOne` is increased by 1 if `s[mid + 1]` is not '0', `s[mid + 1]` is '0' if `tleftZero` is increased by 1, otherwise `s[mid + 1]` is not '0'**.

Explanation: The line `trightZero -= 1` decreases the value of `trightZero` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
