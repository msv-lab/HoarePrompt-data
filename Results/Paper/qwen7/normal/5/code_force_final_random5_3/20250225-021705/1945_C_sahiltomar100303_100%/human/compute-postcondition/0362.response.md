Output State: **`i` is `mid`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `mid`, and the character at index `i` in string `s` is not '0'; `rightOne` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `trightOne += 1` increments the value of `rightOne` by 1. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, `i` is still `mid`, `n` must still be greater than or equal to `mid`, and the character at index `i` in string `s` is still not '0', while `rightOne` has been increased by 1.
