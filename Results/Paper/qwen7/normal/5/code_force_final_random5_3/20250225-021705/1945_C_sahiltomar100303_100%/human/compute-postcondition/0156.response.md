Postcondition: `total` is 0, `students` is either 1 or 2 less than its initial value (depending on the value of `s[right]`), `trightOne` is either less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2` or decreased by 1 (depending on the value of `s[right]`), `tleftZero` is 3 if `s[right]` is '0' and 2 if `s[right]` is '1', `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is increased by 1 if `s[right]` is not '0', `right` is equal to `n`, and either `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2` holds true. This condition remains consistent regardless of whether `left` is 0 or not, and the value of `trightOne` and the relationship between `tleftZero` and `(right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne` and `(n - right + 1) // 2` are adjusted accordingly based on the value of `s[right]` and the comparison with `left`.
