Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `students` is either 1 or 2 less than its initial value (depending on the value of `s[right]`), `trightOne` is either less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2` or decreased by 1 (depending on the value of `s[right]`), `tleftZero` is 3 if `s[right]` is '0' and 2 if `s[right]` is '1', `trightZero` is 0 less than its previous value, `tleftOne` is increased by 1 if `s[right]` is not '0', `right` is equal to `n`, and either `tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne >= (n - right + 1) // 2` holds true. The absolute difference between `left` and `(n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `right` and `(n + 1) // 2`.**
