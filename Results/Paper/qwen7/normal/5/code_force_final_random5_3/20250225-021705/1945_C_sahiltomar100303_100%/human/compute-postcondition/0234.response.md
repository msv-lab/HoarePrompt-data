Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be at least 2, `leftZero` is adjusted based on the value of `s[left - 1]`: if `s[left - 1]` is '0', `leftZero` is decreased by 1; otherwise, `leftZero` remains unchanged and `rightOne` is increased by 1 while `leftOne` is decreased by 1, and `rightZero` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The line `left -= 1` decrements the value of `left` by 1. Since `left` was previously adjusted based on the value of `s[left - 1]`, the new value of `left` is now `left - 1`. The values of `total`, `i`, `n`, `leftZero`, `rightOne`, `leftOne`, and `rightZero` remain unchanged except for `left` which is now `left - 1`.
