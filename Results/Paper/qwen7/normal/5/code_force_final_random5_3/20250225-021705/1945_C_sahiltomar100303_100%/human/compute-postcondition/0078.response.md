Postcondition: `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is greater than `mid`, `mid` must be greater than 1, `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the substring `s[mid:n]` adjusted by adding 1 if `s[left - 1] == '0'`, `rightOne` is either less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2` or incremented by 1 depending on the condition, `left` is `mid - 1`, `leftMove` is `0`, `leftZero` is `leftZero - 1` adjusted based on whether `s[left - 1] == '0'`, and `leftOne` is `leftOne - 1` adjusted based on whether `s[left - 1] != '0'`, with both `leftZero` and `rightOne` still maintaining their constraints of being less than `mid // 2` and `(n - mid + 2) // 2` respectively.
