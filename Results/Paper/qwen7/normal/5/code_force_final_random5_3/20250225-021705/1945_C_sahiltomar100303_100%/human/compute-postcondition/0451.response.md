Based on the initial state provided:

- `right` is equal to `n`.
- `left` remains 0.
- `tleftZero` is less than or equal to `n // 2`.
- `trightZero` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `trightOne` is less than or equal to `n // 2`.
- `tleftOne` is greater than or equal to 0.
- The condition `rightOne < (n + 1) // 2` is true.

The `print(right)` statement will print the value of the variable `right`, which is explicitly stated to be equal to `n`.

Output: **n**
