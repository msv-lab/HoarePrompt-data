Output State: **`leftZero` is now `trightZero + rightZero`, `left` is equal to `mid`, `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` must hold true, and the current value of `s[left - 1]` is '0'.**

Explanation: The code increments `rightZero` by 1. The initial state of `leftZero` was `trightZero + rightZero - 1`. After incrementing `rightZero`, the new value of `leftZero` becomes `trightZero + rightZero`. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged.
