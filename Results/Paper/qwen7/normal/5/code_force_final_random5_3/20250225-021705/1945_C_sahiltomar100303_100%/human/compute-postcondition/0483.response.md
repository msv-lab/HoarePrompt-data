Postcondition: `right` is equal to `n`, `left` remains 0, `tleftZero` is less than or equal to `n // 2`, `trightZero` is greater than or equal to 0, `trightOne` is less than or equal to `n // 2`, `tleftOne` is greater than or equal to 0, and `left` is not equal to 0. If `right == n`, then `tleftZero` is adjusted such that if `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, it remains unchanged; otherwise, `tleftZero` is less than or equal to `n // 2` while keeping other conditions intact. Otherwise, the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`.
