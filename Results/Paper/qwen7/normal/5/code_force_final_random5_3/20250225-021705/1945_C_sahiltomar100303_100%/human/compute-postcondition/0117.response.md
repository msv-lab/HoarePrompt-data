Postcondition: `total` is 0, `students` is either 1 or 2 less than its initial value (depending on the value of `s[right]`), `trightOne` is either less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2` or decreased by 1 (depending on the value of `s[right]`), `tleftZero` is 2 if `s[right]` is '0' and 1 if `s[right]` is '1', `trightZero` is 0 or 1 less than its previous value, `tleftOne` is increased by 1 (and now equals `tleftOne` + 1), `right` is increased by 1 (now equals `right` + 1), and either `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2` must hold true.
