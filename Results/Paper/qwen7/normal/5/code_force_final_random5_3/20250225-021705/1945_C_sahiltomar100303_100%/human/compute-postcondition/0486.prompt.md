Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 2⋅10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and a is a string of length n consisting only of '0' and '1'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    mid = n // 2
    leftZero = 0
    rightZero = 0
    leftOne = 0
    rightOne = 0
    tleftZero = 0
    trightZero = 0
    tleftOne = 0
    trightOne = 0
    for i in range(mid):
        if s[i] == '0':
            leftZero += 1
            tleftZero += 1
        else:
            leftOne += 1
            tleftOne += 1
    for i in range(mid, n):
        if s[i] == '0':
            rightZero += 1
            trightZero += 1
        else:
            rightOne += 1
            trightOne += 1
    left = mid
    leftMove = 0
    while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left +
        1) // 2):
        if s[left - 1] == '0':
            leftZero -= 1
            rightZero += 1
        else:
            leftOne -= 1
            rightOne += 1
        left -= 1
    right = mid
    while right < n and (tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n -
        right + 1) // 2):
        if s[right] == '0':
            tleftZero += 1
            trightZero -= 1
        else:
            tleftOne += 1
            trightOne -= 1
        right += 1
    if left == 0:
        if right != n:
            print(right)
        elif rightOne >= (n + 1) // 2:
            print(left)
        else:
            print(right)
    elif right == n:
        if left != 0:
            print(left)
        elif tleftZero >= (n + 1) // 2:
            print(right)
        else:
            print(left)
    elif abs((n + 1) // 2 - left) <= abs((n + 1) // 2 - right):
        print(left)
    else:
        print(right)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `total` is 0, `students` is either 1 or 2 less than its initial value (depending on the value of `s[right]`), `trightOne` is either less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2` or decreased by 1 (depending on the value of `s[right]`), `tleftZero` is 3 if `s[right]` is '0' and 2 if `s[right]` is '1', `trightZero` is 0, `tleftOne` is increased by 1 if `s[right]` is not '0', `right` is equal to `n`, and either `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2` holds true. This condition remains consistent regardless of whether `left` is 0 or not, and the value of `trightOne` and the relationship between `tleftZero` and `(right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne` and `(n - right + 1) // 2` are adjusted accordingly based on the value of `s[right]` and the comparison with `left`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `right` is the maximum index such that the condition `(tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2)` still holds, `tleftZero` is the total count of '0's from index `0` to `right-1`, `trightZero` is the count of '0's from `right` to the final value of `left`, `trightOne` is the count of '1's from `right` to the final value of `left`, `tleftOne` is the total count of '1's from index `0` to `right-1`, `left` is the last index where the condition was met, `leftMove` is the number of times `left` was incremented, and `s` remains unchanged. Additionally, if `right` equals `n`, either `left` is not equal to 0 and the condition still holds, or `left` is 0 and the condition does not hold, or `left` is 0 and `tleftZero` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`. If `right` does not equal `n`, `left` is not equal to 0, and the condition is adjusted accordingly to ensure `right` is the maximum index satisfying the condition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `right` is equal to `n`, `left` remains 0, `tleftZero` is less than or equal to `n // 2`, `trightZero` is greater than or equal to 0, `trightOne` is less than or equal to `n // 2`, `tleftOne` is greater than or equal to 0. Additionally, if `left == 0`, the following conditions hold:
- If `right != n`, the postcondition holds.
- If `right == n`, then either `tleftZero` remains unchanged if it is already greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, or `tleftZero` is adjusted to be less than or equal to `n // 2` while maintaining other conditions.
- If `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, the postcondition holds regardless of the value of `tleftZero`.
- If `rightOne` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`, the postcondition also holds.

If `left` is not equal to 0, the following conditions hold:
- `tleftZero` is adjusted such that if it is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, it remains unchanged; otherwise, it is less than or equal to `n // 2` while keeping other conditions intact.
- The absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `left` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `(n + 1) // 2` and `right`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
