To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition Breakdown:**
   - The loop continues as long as `left > 0`.
   - Additionally, the loop continues if either:
     - `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2`
     - `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2`

2. **Current States:**
   - `i` is `n - 2`
   - `n` is greater than `mid`
   - `mid` must be greater than 1
   - `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the substring `s[mid:n]` plus 1 or remains the same
   - `rightOne` must be less than `(n - mid + 2) // 2`
   - `left` is `mid - 2`
   - `leftMove` is `0`
   - `leftZero` is `leftZero - 1`, and `leftZero` is less than `mid // 2`
   - `leftOne` is `leftOne - 1` (if `s[left - 1] != '0'`)

3. **Adjusting States:**
   - **`left`:** The loop condition `left > 0` directly depends on `left`. Since `left` is currently `mid - 2`, we need to ensure that `left` remains positive for the loop to continue.
   - **`leftZero`:** The condition `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` depends on `leftZero`. We need to ensure that `leftZero` is less than `(left + 1) // 2`.
   - **`rightOne`:** The condition `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` depends on `rightOne`. We need to ensure that `rightOne` is less than `(n - left + 1) // 2`.

### Adjusted States:

- To ensure `left > 0`, `left` should remain `mid - 2` (as it is already `mid - 2`).
- To ensure `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2`, `leftZero` should remain `leftZero - 1` (as it is already `leftZero - 1`).
- To ensure `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2`, `rightOne` should remain as it is (since it is already less than `(n - mid + 2) // 2`).

### Final Answer:

State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is greater than `mid`, `mid` must be greater than 1, `rightZero` is the count of '0's in the substring `s[mid:n]` plus 1 or remains the same, `rightOne` must be less than `(n - mid + 2) // 2`, `left` is `mid - 2`, `leftMove` is `0`, `leftZero` is `leftZero - 1`, `leftZero` is less than `mid // 2`, and `rightOne` must be less than `(n - (mid - 2) + 1) // 2`**
