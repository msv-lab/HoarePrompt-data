Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a string input by the user, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0**.

The code simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `rightZero`. Since `n`, `s`, `mid`, and `leftZero` were not affected by this line of code, their values remain unchanged.
