Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(mid, n)`. This means `i` will take values from `mid` to `n-1`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = mid` and increments `i` in each iteration, the initial value of `i` must be `mid`.

3. **Determine the Final State of `i`**: According to the given information, after all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to `mid - 1`.

4. **Determine the Value of `n`**: Since the loop runs until `i < n`, and `i` ends up being `mid - 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `mid`.

5. **Check the Given Information**: The problem states that after the loop executes all iterations, `leftZero` and `leftOne` will be equal to `2 * mid`. However, this information is not directly related to the loop head and thus does not need to be included in the state adjustment for the loop to execute.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be set to `mid` initially.
- `n` should be greater than or equal to `mid`.

Therefore, the final answer is:

**State: **`i` is `mid`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `mid`**
