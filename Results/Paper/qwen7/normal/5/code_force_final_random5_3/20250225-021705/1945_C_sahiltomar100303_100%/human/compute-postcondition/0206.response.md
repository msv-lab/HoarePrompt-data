Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values at the start of the loop**:
   - `i` is set to `mid`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Analyze the changes in the loop**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `mid` and `n` is an input integer.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `mid + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise in the loop body, but since no such change is mentioned, it stays the same.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be `mid + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same input integer.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`total` is 0, `i` is `mid + 1`, `n` is an input integer**
