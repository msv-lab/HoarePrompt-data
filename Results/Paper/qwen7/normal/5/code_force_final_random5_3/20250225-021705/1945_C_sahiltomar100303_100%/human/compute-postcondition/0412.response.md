Output State: `left` is equal to 0, `leftZero` is equal to `trightZero + rightZero - k`, `rightZero` is equal to `rightZero + k`, and `rightOne` is equal to `rightOne + k`, where `k` is the number of times the loop executed.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `left > 0` and the condition `(leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2)` holds true. Each iteration of the loop decreases `left` by 1, adjusts `leftZero` and `rightZero` if `s[left - 1] == '0'`, and adjusts `leftOne` and `rightOne` if `s[left - 1] != '0'`. Since the loop continues until `left` reaches 0, it will execute `mid` times (or one less if `left` becomes 0 before completing `mid` iterations). After all iterations, `left` will be 0, and `leftZero` will be reduced by the number of times `s[left - 1] == '0'` was true during the loop, which is `k`. Similarly, `rightZero` and `rightOne` will each increase by `k`.
