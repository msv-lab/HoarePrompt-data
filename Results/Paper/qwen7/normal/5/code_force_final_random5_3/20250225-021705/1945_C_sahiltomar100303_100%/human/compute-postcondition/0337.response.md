Output State: **`i` is 0, `mid` is greater than 0, and `s[i]` is not '0'; `leftOne` is 1**.

The code `leftOne += 1` increments the value of `leftOne` by 1. Since `leftOne` was initially not specified, we assume it started at 0 (as no other initial value is given). After executing the code, `leftOne` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
