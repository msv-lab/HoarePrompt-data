### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

#### Input Handling:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
- It reads the value of `x` for each test case and calls the function `func_1(x)` to find the appropriate `y`.

#### Function `func_1`:
- The function aims to find `y` such that `gcd(x, y) + y` is maximized.
- It iterates over possible values of `y` from `x-1` down to `2` (since `y` must be less than `x`).
- For each `y`, it checks if `x % y == 0` (i.e., `y` is a divisor of `x`).
- If `y` is a divisor and `2 * y >= x`, it returns `y` immediately because this condition ensures that `gcd(x, y) + y` is maximized.
- If no such `y` is found during the loop, it returns the last `y` that was checked (which is stored in `max_val`).

#### Verification of Correctness:

1. **Edge Cases:**
   - For `x = 2`, the only possible `y` is `1` since `1` is the only number less than `2`. The function correctly returns `1`.
   - For `x = 3`, the only possible `y` is `1` or `2`. Since `2` is not a divisor, the function returns `1`.
   - For `x = 4`, the divisors are `1` and `2`. Since `2` is a divisor and `2 * 2 >= 4`, the function returns `2`.

2. **General Case:**
   - The function iterates backward from `x-1` to `2` and finds the largest `y` that is a divisor of `x` and satisfies `2 * y >= x`.
   - This approach ensures that `gcd(x, y) + y` is maximized because the greatest common divisor will be maximized when `y` is a large divisor of `x`.

3. **Output Validation:**
   - The provided examples in the problem statement match the expected behavior of the function.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of the function. The function is designed to return the largest `y` such that `2 * y >= x` and `y` is a divisor of `x`. But the goal is to maximize `gcd(x, y) + y`, not just ensure `2 * y >= x`.

Consider the following counterexample:
- For `x = 6`, the divisors are `1, 2, 3`. The function would return `3` because `3` is a divisor and `2 * 3 >= 6`. However, `gcd(6, 3) + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6`.
- But the correct answer should be `2` because `gcd(6, 2) + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4`, which is greater than `6`.

Therefore, the function does not always return the correct `y` that maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y`.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum possible value of `gcd(x, y) + y` for each test case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness:** False

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
