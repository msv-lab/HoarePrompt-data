You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        y = func_1(x)
        print(y)

def func_1(x):
    """Finds the y that maximizes gcd(x, y) + y.

  Args:
    x: The given integer.

  Returns:
    The optimal y.
  """
    max_val = 1
    for y in range(x - 1, 1, -1):
        if x % y == 0:
            if 2 * y >= x:
                return y
            max_val = y
    return max_val



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer \( x \) such that \( 2 \leq x \leq 1000 \). It returns the largest integer \( y \) that satisfies one of the following conditions:
1. \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \) and \( x > 1 \) and \( x \leq 2y \).
2. \( x \) is divisible by \( y-1 \) and \( 2(y-1) < x \).
3. \( y = x - 2 \) when \( x > 2 \).
If no such \( y \) exists, it returns 1.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - It reads the value of `x` for each test case and calls the function `func_1(x)` to find the appropriate `y`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function aims to find `y` such that `gcd(x, y) + y` is maximized.
   - It iterates over possible values of `y` from `x-1` down to `2` (since `y` must be less than `x`).
   - For each `y`, it checks if `x % y == 0` (i.e., `y` is a divisor of `x`).
   - If `y` is a divisor and `2 * y >= x`, it returns `y` immediately because this condition ensures that `gcd(x, y) + y` is maximized.
   - If no such `y` is found during the loop, it returns the last `y` that was checked (which is stored in `max_val`).

### Verification of Correctness:

1. **Edge Cases:**
   - For `x = 2`, the only possible `y` is `1` since `1` is the only number less than `2`. The function correctly returns `1`.
   - For `x = 3`, the only possible `y` is `1` or `2`. Since `2` is not a divisor, the function returns `1`.
   - For `x = 4`, the divisors are `1` and `2`. Since `2` is a divisor and `2 * 2 >= 4`, the function returns `2`.

2. **General Case:**
   - The function iterates backward from `x-1` to `2` and finds the largest `y` that is a divisor of `x` and satisfies `2 * y >= x`.
   - This approach ensures that `gcd(x, y) + y` is maximized because the greatest common divisor will be maximized when `y` is a large divisor of `x`.

3. **Output Validation:**
   - The provided examples in the problem statement match the expected behavior of the function.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible value of `gcd(x, y) + y` for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
