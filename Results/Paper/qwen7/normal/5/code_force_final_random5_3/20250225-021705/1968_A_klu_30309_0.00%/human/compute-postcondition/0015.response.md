Postcondition: `x` is an integer greater than 1, and `max_val` is `y - 1`. If `2 * y >= x`, the function returns `y`, where `y` is such that `x` is divisible by `y - 1` and `2 * (y - 1)` is less than `x`. If `2 * y < x`, the function does not perform any specific action related to changing `y` or `max_val`.
