State: **`max_val` is 1, `x` must be greater than 1** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head involves the variables `y` and `x`.
2. The condition for the loop to start is `x - 1 > 1`, which simplifies to `x > 2`.
3. If `x` is not greater than 2, the loop will not execute.
4. The variable `y` will take values from `x-1` down to 2 (inclusive), but its initial value and the exact sequence of values are not directly relevant to the loop's execution condition.
5. The variable `max_val` is given as 1, but this does not affect the loop's ability to execute based on the provided range condition.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment for the loop to execute is ensuring that `x` is greater than 2.
