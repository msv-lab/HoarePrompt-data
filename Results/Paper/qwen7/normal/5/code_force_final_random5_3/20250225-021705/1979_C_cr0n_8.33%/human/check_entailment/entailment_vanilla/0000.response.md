Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to distribute coins among different outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each winning outcome. The program should output a distribution of bets that satisfies this condition, or `-1` if it's impossible.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `k_i`.
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers (`prod`).
   - It then computes a list `vprod` where each element is `prod // r` for each multiplier `r`.
   - It calculates `den` as `prod - sum(vprod)`.
   - If `den` is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1`, indicating no valid distribution exists.
   - Otherwise, it prints the values in `vprod`.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed because it does not ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - Instead, it calculates `vprod` as `prod // r` for each `r`, which means the total bet would be `sum(vprod)`, and the received amount for each outcome would be `prod`. This does not guarantee that the total bet is strictly less than the received amount for any winning outcome.
   - The variable `den` is calculated as `prod - sum(vprod)`, but this does not directly relate to the required condition.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to find a distribution of bets such that the total bet is strictly less than the received amount for any winning outcome.
   - A simple approach could be to bet a small constant amount (e.g., 1) on each outcome and check if the condition is satisfied.

Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
