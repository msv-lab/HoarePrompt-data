Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 50\), `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `prod` is the product of all elements in `vals`, `r` is the last element of `vals`.

In this final output state, `t` and `N` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop. The `vals` list contains all the original integers that were processed. The variable `prod` has been updated to hold the cumulative product of all elements in `vals`. The variable `r` holds the value of the last element in `vals` since it is reassigned in each iteration of the loop.
