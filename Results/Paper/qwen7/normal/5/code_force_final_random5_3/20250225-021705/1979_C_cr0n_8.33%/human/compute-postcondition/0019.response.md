Functionality: **The function reads two inputs: the number of test cases `N` and a list of integers `vals`. It calculates the product of all integers in `vals` and then computes a new list `vprod` where each element is the product of all elements in `vals` divided by the corresponding element in `vals` (excluding the last element). It also calculates `den` as the difference between the product and the sum of `vprod`. If `den` is less than or equal to zero, it prints `-1` and returns. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` separated by spaces. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
