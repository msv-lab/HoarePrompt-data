Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 50\), `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `prod` is the product of all elements in `vals`, `r` is the last element of `vals`, `vprod` is a list where each element is the product of `prod` divided by each element `r` in `vals` (excluding the last element).**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `vprod` where each element is calculated as `prod // r` for each `r` in `vals`. Since `r` is the last element of `vals` in the context of the loop, the division operation is performed for each element in `vals` except the last one. The values of `t`, `N`, `vals`, `prod`, and `r` are updated as described in the initial state and the operations performed in the code.
