You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\) and \(t > 3\), `i` is equal to `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces for each iteration of the loop.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be the final value it was initialized to by the user, which must be greater than 3 since the loop runs at least 3 times. The variable `i` will be equal to `t` because `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the last set of integers inputted by the user during the last iteration of the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIR' if this condition is met.
   - It checks if `a < b > c` and prints 'PEAK' if this condition is met.
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints 'NONE'.

3. **Conditions for Stair and Peak:**
   - A stair is defined as `a < b < c`.
   - A peak is defined as `a < b > c`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles all possible combinations of `a`, `b`, and `c` within the specified range (0 to 9).
   - It correctly identifies when the numbers form a stair, a peak, or neither.

### Testing the Conditions:
- **Stair Condition (`a < b < c`):**
  - Example: `1 2 3` should print 'STAIR'.
  - Example: `1 5 3` should not print 'STAIR' because `5 > 3`.

- **Peak Condition (`a < b > c`):**
  - Example: `3 2 1` should print 'PEAK'.
  - Example: `3 4 1` should print 'PEAK'.
  - Example: `4 1 7` should not print 'PEAK' because `1 < 7`.

- **Neither Condition:**
  - Examples like `3 2 2`, `1 1 1`, etc., should print 'NONE'.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. It handles all the edge cases and examples provided in the problem statement accurately.

### Final Answer:
