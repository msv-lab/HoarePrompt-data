You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\) and \(t > 3\), `i` is equal to `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces for each iteration of the loop.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be the final value it was initialized to by the user, which must be greater than 3 since the loop runs at least 3 times. The variable `i` will be equal to `t` because `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the last set of integers inputted by the user during the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes up to 1000 test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) within the range 0 to 9. For each test case, it determines whether the integers form a 'STAIR' (if \(a < b < c\)), a 'PEAK' (if \(a < b > c\)), or neither ('NONE'). After processing all test cases, it outputs the results for each case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where `a`, `b`, and `c` are equal (i.e., `a == b == c`). According to the problem description, such a case should be classified as "NONE". However, the current implementation will incorrectly classify `0 0 0` as "STAIR" or "PEAK" depending on the order of comparison, which is not correct. For example:

- Input: `0 0 0`
- Expected Output: `NONE`
- Program Output: `STAIR` or `PEAK` (depending on the order of comparison)

To fix this, the conditions should be checked in a way that ensures equality is handled correctly. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

This version explicitly checks for the case where `a == b == c` and prints "NONE" in that case, ensuring the program works correctly for all potential inputs.
