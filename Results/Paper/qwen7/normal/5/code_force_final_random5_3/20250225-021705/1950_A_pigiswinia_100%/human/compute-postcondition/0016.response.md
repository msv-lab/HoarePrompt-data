Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\) and \(t > 0\), `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces.**

The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input, splits them by spaces, and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
