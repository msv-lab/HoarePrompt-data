Output State: `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\) and \(t > 3\), `i` is equal to `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces for each iteration of the loop.

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be the final value it was initialized to by the user, which must be greater than 3 since the loop runs at least 3 times. The variable `i` will be equal to `t` because `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the last set of integers inputted by the user during the last iteration of the loop.
