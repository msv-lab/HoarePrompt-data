Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) using `map(int, input().split())`.
3. It checks the conditions for a 'STAIR' and a 'PEAK' as specified:
   - A 'STAIR' is determined by the condition `a < b < c`.
   - A 'PEAK' is determined by the condition `a < b > c`.
4. If neither condition is met, it prints 'NONE'.
5. The logic in the program matches the problem description perfectly.

Given the execution summary and the reasoning above, the program appears to be correct according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
