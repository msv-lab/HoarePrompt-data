Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, and t must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned the values from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial value of `t` and `i` remains unchanged. The input is split into three integers, which are then converted to integers using `map(int, ...)`.
