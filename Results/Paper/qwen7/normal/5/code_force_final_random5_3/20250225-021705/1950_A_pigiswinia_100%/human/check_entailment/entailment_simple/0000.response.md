Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. It checks the conditions for a stair (`a < b < c`) and a peak (`a < b > c`).
4. If the digits satisfy the stair condition, it prints "STAIR".
5. If the digits satisfy the peak condition, it prints "PEAK".
6. Otherwise, it prints "NONE".

The logic implemented in the program matches the problem description perfectly. There are no logical errors or missing conditions that would cause incorrect outputs based on the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
