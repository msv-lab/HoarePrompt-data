Postcondition: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 and t must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned the values from the input split. If the condition `a < b < c` is true, then the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` maintain the relation `a < b < c`. Otherwise, the condition `a` is not less than `b` or `b` is not less than `c` holds.
