Output State: **`res` is the original value of `res` plus the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3)`, where `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`**.

Explanation: The code `res += math.comb(cnt, 3)` updates the value of `res` by adding the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` to its current value. Here, `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`. The initial state of `res` is "the original value of `res` plus the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` where `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`". After executing the code, the updated value of `res` includes this additional term. The other variables remain in their initial state, specifically `num_of_lens` and `total_sum` are not affected.
