Output State: **`num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `res` contains the sum of combinations, `t` is 0 or negative, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input by spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `nums = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, and converts each element to an integer. These integers are then stored in the list `nums`. The other variables (`num_of_lens`, `res`, `t`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
