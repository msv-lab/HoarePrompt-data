Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `cnt` which is taken from `num_of_lens.values()`.
   - Therefore, the only variable in the loop head is `cnt`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue as long as there are more values in `num_of_lens.values()` to iterate over.
   - Since `cnt` is being used as the iterator, the loop will continue as long as there are more values in `num_of_lens.values()`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `num_of_lens` is not an empty dictionary.
   - `res` is increased by either `math.comb(cnt, 3) + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` or `math.comb(cnt, 3)`.
   - The value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2.
   - `total_sum` is the sum of values in `num_of_lens.values()` excluding those equal to `cnt`.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `cnt` must be the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`.
   - Since `cnt` was previously greater than or equal to 2, the next value in `num_of_lens.values()` must also be greater than or equal to 2.
   - `total_sum` remains the same because it is based on the current state of `num_of_lens` and does not change within the loop.

5. **Final State for the Next Iteration:**
   - `num_of_lens` is still not an empty dictionary.
   - `res` is increased by either `math.comb(cnt, 3) + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` or `math.comb(cnt, 3)`.
   - The value of `cnt` is now the next value in `num_of_lens.values()` and is greater than or equal to 2.
   - `total_sum` remains the same.

**State:**
**`num_of_lens` is not an empty dictionary, `res` is increased by either `math.comb(cnt, 3) + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` or `math.comb(cnt, 3)`, and the value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2; `total_sum` is the sum of values in `num_of_lens.values()` excluding those equal to `cnt`.**
