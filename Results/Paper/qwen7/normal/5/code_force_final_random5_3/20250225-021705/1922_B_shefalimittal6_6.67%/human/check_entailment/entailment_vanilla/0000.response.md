Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and their corresponding lengths stored in `nums`.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - It uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each unique length in `nums`.

3. **Calculating Combinations:**
   - The program iterates over the values in `num_of_lens` (i.e., counts of each unique length).
   - If a length appears at least 3 times (`cnt >= 3`), it adds the number of ways to choose 3 such lengths using `math.comb(cnt, 3)`.
   - If a length appears at least 2 times (`cnt >= 2`), it calculates the total number of other lengths (`total_sum`) and adds the number of ways to choose 2 such lengths and one of the other lengths using `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`.

4. **Outputting Results:**
   - The result `res` is printed for each test case.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Triangle Inequality Check:**
   - The problem requires forming a non-degenerate triangle, which means the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.
   - The current implementation does not check this condition. It simply counts combinations without verifying the triangle inequality.

2. **Incorrect Calculation:**
   - The logic for counting valid triangles is flawed because it does not consider the triangle inequality. For example, if we have lengths \(2^1, 2^1, 2^2\), the combination should not be counted as a valid triangle since \(2^1 + 2^1 \not> 2^2\).

### Correctness Evaluation

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. It fails to account for the triangle inequality, which is a crucial part of the problem.

### Conclusion

**Correctness: **False**
