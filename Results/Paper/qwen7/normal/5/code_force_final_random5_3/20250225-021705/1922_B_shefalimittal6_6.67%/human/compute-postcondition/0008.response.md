Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with the key `next_x` and value 2, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element (one less than before)**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `num_of_lens[x]` to be the number of times `x` has appeared so far, using the `get` method which returns the value for `x` if it exists in the dictionary, or 0 if it does not. Since `x` is not specified, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know that the count for `x` (which was previously 1) is incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
