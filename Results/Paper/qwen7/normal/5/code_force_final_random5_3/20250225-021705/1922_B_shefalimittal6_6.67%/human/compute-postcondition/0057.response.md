Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop is iterating over `cnt` which is taken from `num_of_lens.values()`.
   - Therefore, the only variable in the loop head is `cnt`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `cnt`:**
   - Since `cnt` is being iterated over the values of `num_of_lens`, it will take on the values of the counts of the elements in `nums`.
   - The initial state of `cnt` is not specified directly, but it will start with one of the values in `num_of_lens.values()`.

3. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute as long as there are values in `num_of_lens.values()`.
   - This means that `num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - We need to ensure that `num_of_lens` has at least one key-value pair for the loop to start executing.
   - The other variables (`res`, `num_of_lens`, `n`, `nums`, and `x`) do not affect whether the loop can execute and can remain in their given states.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair**
