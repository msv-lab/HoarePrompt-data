Postcondition: `res` is updated to `res + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `cnt` is updated to the next value in the sequence of `num_of_lens.values()`, and `total_sum` remains the sum of the values in `num_of_lens` excluding the current value of `cnt`. If `cnt` is less than 2, `res` remains unchanged and `cnt` is updated to the next value in the sequence of `num_of_lens.values()`.
