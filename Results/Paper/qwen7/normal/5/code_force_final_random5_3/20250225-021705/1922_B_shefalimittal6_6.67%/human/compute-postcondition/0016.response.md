Output State: **`res` is increased by math.comb(cnt, 3), `num_of_lens` is not an empty dictionary, and the value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3.**

Explanation: The variable `res` is incremented by the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. The value of `num_of_lens` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the given code snippet. Similarly, the condition that `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3 remains valid.
