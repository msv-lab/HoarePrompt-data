Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `x` and `nums`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `nums`. The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `nums`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with key `x` and value 2.
   - `res` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element.
   - `x` is the second element of `nums`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `x` is the second element of `nums`, the loop has processed the first element already.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `nums` must have at least two elements (so that `x` can be set to the third element).
   - After processing the second element, `x` will be set to the third element of `nums`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `num_of_lens` remains unchanged because it does not depend on the loop variable `x`.
   - `res` remains 0 because the loop body is omitted and no operations are performed on `res`.
   - `n` remains the same as it is an input integer and not affected by the loop.
   - `nums` must now have at least two elements, and `x` will be set to the third element of `nums`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with key `x` and value 2, `res` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements, `x` is the third element of `nums`**
