Output State: **`res` is increased by math.comb(cnt, 3), `num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair, and the value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3**

Explanation: The variable `res` is incremented by the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. The function `math.comb(cnt, 3)` calculates the number of ways to choose 3 items from `cnt` items without regard to order. The values of `num_of_lens` and `cnt` remain unchanged from their initial state.
