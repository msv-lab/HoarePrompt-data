Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each key from the list `nums` is mapped to its frequency in `nums`, `res` is 0, `t` is 0 or negative, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
    if cnt >= 3:
        res += math.comb(cnt, 3)
    if cnt >= 2:
        total_sum = sum(i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt)
        res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that must contain at least one value, `res` is the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3) + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `t` is 0 or negative, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is an empty list, and `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, where `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` excluding the value of `cnt`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that must contain at least one value, `res` is the value of `math.comb(cnt, 3) + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, `t` is 0 or negative, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is an empty list, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`, and if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that must contain at least one value, `res` is updated to `math.comb(cnt, 3) + 2 * math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` if `cnt >= 2`, otherwise `res` remains unchanged. `t` is 0 or negative, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is an empty list, `cnt` is the next value in `num_of_lens.values()` that satisfies `cnt >= 3`, and `total_sum` is the sum of values in `num_of_lens.values()` excluding `cnt`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
