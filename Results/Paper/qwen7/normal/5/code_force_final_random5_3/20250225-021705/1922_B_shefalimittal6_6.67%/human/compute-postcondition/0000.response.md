Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4 remains valid, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the only change is that `t` now holds the value of the input integer.
