Output State: **`num_of_lens` is a dictionary with key `x` and value 1, `res` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `x` is the first element of `nums`.**

Explanation: The code updates the dictionary `num_of_lens` by incrementing the count of the key `x` (which is the first element of the list `nums`). Since `x` was not previously in the dictionary, `get(x, 0)` returns 0, and then 1 is added to it, making the value 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
