Output State: **`num_of_lens` contains all processed key-value pairs, `res` contains the sum of combinations, `t` is 0 or negative, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The values of `num_of_lens` and `res` remain unchanged, and `t` remains 0 or negative.
