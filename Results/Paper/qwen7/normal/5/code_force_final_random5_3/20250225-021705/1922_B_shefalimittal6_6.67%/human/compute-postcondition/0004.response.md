Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers using `input().split()`, which splits the input string into a list of strings. The `map(int, ...)` function then converts each string in the list to an integer. The resulting list of integers is assigned to the variable `nums`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `num_of_lens` remains an empty dictionary.
