Output State: **`num_of_lens` is not an empty dictionary, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3) + math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, and the value of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2; `total_sum` is the sum of values in `num_of_lens.values()` excluding those equal to `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `res` by adding `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` to the existing value of `res`. The other variables (`num_of_lens`, `cnt`, and `total_sum`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
