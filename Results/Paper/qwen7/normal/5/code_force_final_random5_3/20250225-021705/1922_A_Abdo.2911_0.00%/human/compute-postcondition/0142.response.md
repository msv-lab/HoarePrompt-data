Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, and `template` contains the uppercase version of `a[0]`. This is because if `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, `template` will contain the value of `a[0]` or its uppercase version as per the initial precondition, but since `i` is incremented to 1, `template` will retain the uppercase version of `a[0]` from the else part. If the condition `a[i] == b[i]` is false, `template` will still be the uppercase version of `a[0]` as specified in the else part.
