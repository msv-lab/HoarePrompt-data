Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is either 0 or 1.
   - `n` is greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` was either 0 or 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` would be 1 or 0 respectively (depending on the current value).
   - `n` remains the same and must still be greater than 0.

Given these points, let's construct the new state:

- If `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` would be 1.
- If `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` would be 0.

In both cases, `n` remains greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 1 if it was 0 previously, otherwise `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**.
