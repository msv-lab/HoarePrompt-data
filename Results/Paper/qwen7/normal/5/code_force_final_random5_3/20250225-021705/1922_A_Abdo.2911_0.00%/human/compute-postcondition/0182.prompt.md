Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `match_a_b` is True
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if template[i].islower():
        if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
            match_a_b = False
            break
    elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i
        ].lower():
        match_a_b = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `match_a_b` is True, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` is greater than 0. If the first element of `template` is not a lowercase letter, the match status remains True; otherwise, if `a[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`, the match status remains True; otherwise, `match_a_b` becomes False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `match_a_b` is True, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than 0. If `a[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If neither condition is met, `match_a_b` becomes False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `match_a_b` is either True or False, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than 0. If `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, then `match_a_b` is set to False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i].lower() == template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower() == template[i].lower()` is true, `match_a_b` remains False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out; otherwise, `match_a_b`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
