Output State: **`match_c` is False, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the character at index `i` in `template` is a lowercase letter, and the character at index `i` in `c` is not equal to the character at the same index in `template`. and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or conditional block it is inside. Since no variables are modified and the conditions are unchanged, the only thing that happens is breaking out of the loop or if statement.
