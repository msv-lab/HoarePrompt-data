### Reasoning:

1. **Template Construction**:
   - The program constructs a template based on the characters of `a` and `b`. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, the template uses `a[i]`. Otherwise, it uses `a[i].upper()`.
   - This part seems correct as it ensures that both `a` and `b` will match the template constructed this way.

2. **Matching Conditions for `a` and `b`**:
   - The program checks if both `a` and `b` match the constructed template.
     - If `template[i].islower()`, it checks if `a[i]` or `b[i]` does not equal `template[i]`.
     - If `template[i].isupper()`, it checks if `a[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()`.
   - These checks seem to correctly enforce the matching conditions for `a` and `b`.

3. **Matching Condition for `c`**:
   - The program checks if `c` does not match the constructed template.
     - If `template[i].islower()`, it checks if `c[i]` equals `template[i]`.
     - If `template[i].isupper()`, it checks if `c[i].lower()` does not equal `template[i].lower()`.
   - These checks seem to correctly enforce the non-matching condition for `c`.

4. **Output**:
   - If both `a` and `b` match the template but `c` does not, the program prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".
   - This output logic seems correct based on the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the program, it appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
