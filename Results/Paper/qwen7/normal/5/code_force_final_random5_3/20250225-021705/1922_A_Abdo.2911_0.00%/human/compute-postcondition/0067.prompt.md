Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `match_a_b` is `True`, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `template` is a list containing elements based on the comparison of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`. Specifically, if `a[i]` equals `b[i]`, `a[i]` is appended to `template`; otherwise, `a[i].upper()` is appended to `template`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if template[i].islower():
        if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
            match_a_b = False
            break
    elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i
        ].lower():
        match_a_b = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, and the character at index `i` in `template` is either lowercase or not lowercase. If the character is lowercase, then either `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the character is not lowercase, then if `a[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()`, we break out of the loop. Otherwise, the loop continues without changing the values of `i`, `n`, and `template[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and the character at index `i` in `template` is either lowercase or not lowercase; if `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, `match_a_b` is `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out. If `a[i].lower() == template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower() == template[i].lower()`, `match_a_b` is `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out. If neither condition is met, no change is made to `match_a_b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and the state of `match_a_b` remains unchanged. If `a[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` is equal to `template[i].lower()`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out. Otherwise, if `a[i]` is not equal to `template[i]` or `b[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, `match_a_b` is set to `False` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
