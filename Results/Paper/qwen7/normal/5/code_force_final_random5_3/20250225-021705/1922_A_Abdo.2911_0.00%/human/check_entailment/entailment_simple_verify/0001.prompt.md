You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

    #State: Output State: All iterations of the loop have been executed, with the following conditions met:
    #- The variable `t` contains the total number of iterations the loop ran.
    #- For each iteration, `n` is the length of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
    #- After processing all strings, `template` is a list of characters derived from string `a` such that:
    #  - Characters in `template` are either identical to those in `a` or converted to uppercase if they differ from corresponding characters in `b`.
    #  - `match_a_b` is True if the characters in `template` exactly match the characters in `a` when both are considered in lowercase, and also match the characters in `b` when both are considered in lowercase.
    #  - `match_c` is True if the characters in `template` exactly match the characters in `c` when both are considered in lowercase, and False otherwise.
    #- The final output will be 'YES' if `match_a_b` is True and `match_c` is False, and 'NO' otherwise.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations, the program will check if the processed `template` matches `a` and `b` in a specific way and does not match `c`. If these conditions are satisfied, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Template Construction**:
   - The program constructs a template based on the characters of `a` and `b`. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, the template uses `a[i]`. Otherwise, it uses `a[i].upper()`.
   - This part seems correct as it ensures that both `a` and `b` will match the template constructed this way.

2. **Matching Conditions for `a` and `b`**:
   - The program checks if both `a` and `b` match the constructed template.
     - If `template[i].islower()`, it checks if `a[i]` or `b[i]` does not equal `template[i]`.
     - If `template[i].isupper()`, it checks if `a[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` equals `template[i].lower()`.
   - These checks seem to correctly enforce the matching conditions for `a` and `b`.

3. **Matching Condition for `c`**:
   - The program checks if `c` does not match the constructed template.
     - If `template[i].islower()`, it checks if `c[i]` equals `template[i]`.
     - If `template[i].isupper()`, it checks if `c[i].lower()` does not equal `template[i].lower()`.
   - These checks seem to correctly enforce the non-matching condition for `c`.

4. **Output**:
   - If both `a` and `b` match the template but `c` does not, the program prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".
   - This output logic seems correct based on the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the program, it appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
