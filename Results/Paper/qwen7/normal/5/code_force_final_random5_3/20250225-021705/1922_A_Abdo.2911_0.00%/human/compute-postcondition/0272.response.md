Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < n`.

3. **Analyze the Postcondition**:
   - `template` is a list of characters.
   - `i` is an index within the list.
   - `match_a_b` is a boolean.

4. **Determine the State Changes**:
   - The loop iterates over each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - For each iteration, the conditions inside the loop determine the value of `match_a_b` and whether the loop should continue or break.

5. **Consider the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is the current index.
   - `n` is the upper limit of the loop.
   - `match_a_b` is the boolean value determined by the conditions.

6. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body.
   - The value of `match_a_b` may change based on the conditions inside the loop, but it is not directly adjusted by the loop itself; it is determined by the loop body.

Given the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the next iteration is `i`.

**State:**
**`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be the same as before, and `match_a_b` remains the same as the postcondition from the previous iteration.**

Therefore, the final state for the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be the same as before, and `match_a_b` remains unchanged.**
