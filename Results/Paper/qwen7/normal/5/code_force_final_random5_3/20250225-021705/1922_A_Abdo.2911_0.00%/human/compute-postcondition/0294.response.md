Output State: **All characters in `template` are either unchanged or converted to uppercase, and `match_a_b` is True.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n`, meaning the loop has checked every index in `template`. During each iteration, if a character in `template` is a lowercase letter and does not match the corresponding character in `a` or `b` (also considering case), `match_a_b` is set to `False` and the loop breaks. Similarly, if a character in `template` is not a lowercase letter but a lowercase version of `a[i]` or `b[i]` matches it, `match_a_b` is also set to `False` and the loop breaks. If no such conditions are met throughout all iterations, `match_a_b` remains `True`. Additionally, any lowercase letters in `template` that do not need to be changed due to matching conditions in `a` and `b` are converted to uppercase as per the given rules.
