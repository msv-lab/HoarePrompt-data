Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the same as before, `match_a_b` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no specific loop or conditional context was provided, we assume it breaks out of the most internal one. The values of `i`, `n`, and `match_a_b` remain unchanged.
