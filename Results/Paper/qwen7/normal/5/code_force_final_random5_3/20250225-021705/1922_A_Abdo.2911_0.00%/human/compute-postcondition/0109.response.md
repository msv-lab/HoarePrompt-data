Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `match_c` is either True or False.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `n` must be greater than 0, as it was initially. The variable `match_c` will be True if none of the conditions in the loop were met (i.e., no mismatch found between `c[i]` and `template[i]` considering case insensitivity) throughout the entire loop execution. If any condition was met (i.e., a mismatch was found), `match_c` will be False.
