Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `match_c` is either True or False**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The variable `i` retains its initial value, which is `n`, and `match_c` remains unchanged, being either True or False.
