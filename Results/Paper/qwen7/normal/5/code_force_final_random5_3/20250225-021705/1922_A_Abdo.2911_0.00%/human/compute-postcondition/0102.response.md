Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, and if `c[i]` is not equal to `template[i]`, then `match_c` is set to False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `c[i]` equals `template[i]`, the postcondition remains as initially described (i.e., `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 1, without any change to `match_c`).
