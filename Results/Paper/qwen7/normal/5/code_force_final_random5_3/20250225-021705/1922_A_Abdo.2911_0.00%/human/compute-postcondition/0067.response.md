Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `match_a_b` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n`, indicating that the loop has checked every element in the `template` list. The loop modifies `match_a_b` only if it finds any mismatch between `template[i]` and `a[i]` or `b[i]` under specific conditions. Since the loop has completed all iterations without breaking due to these conditions (as implied by the given states after the first three iterations), `match_a_b` remains `True`.
