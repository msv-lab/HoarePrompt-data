Based on the initial state provided:

- `match_a_b` is either `True` or `False`.
- `match_c` is `False`.
- `i` equals `n`.
- `n` is greater than `0`.
- The condition `(match_a_b is False or match_c is True)` is true.

Given these conditions, let's break down the print statement:

1. The print statement is `print('NO')`.
2. The string `'NO'` is directly printed without any variables being evaluated within it.

Since the string `'NO'` is hardcoded and does not depend on any of the variables (`match_a_b`, `match_c`, `i`, `n`) whose values are explicitly stated or derived from the conditions, the output will be:

Output: **'NO'**
