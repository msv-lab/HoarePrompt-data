Output State: **`match_a_b` is either True or False, `match_c` is False, `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `match_a_b`, `match_c`, or `i`. It only indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the given code, the values remain unchanged, and the only effect is that the program would exit the current loop or conditional structure.
