Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `match_c` is either True or False, `b` is the stripped input string from user**

Explanation: The code `b = input().strip()` reads a line of input from the user, strips any leading and trailing whitespace, and assigns the result to the variable `b`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `match_c` remain unchanged from their initial states.
