Output State: **`match_c` is False, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and `template[i]` is not a lowercase character, and the current value of `c[i]` is equal to the current value of `template[i]` after converting both to lowercase. and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply exits the context where it was placed. All the conditions and values of the variables remain as they were in the initial state.
