Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `template` contains the upper case version of `a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the uppercase version of `a[i]` to the `template` list. Since `i` is `n + 1` and `n` must be greater than 0, these conditions remain unchanged. The only new information is that `template` now includes the uppercase version of `a[i]`.
