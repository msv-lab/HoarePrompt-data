Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same, `match_a_b` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block immediately preceding the `break` statement, it implies that the `break` statement is part of a nested structure (like a loop inside another loop or a nested conditional). The `break` statement does not change the values of `i`, `n`, or `match_a_b`. It simply exits the innermost loop or conditional block.
