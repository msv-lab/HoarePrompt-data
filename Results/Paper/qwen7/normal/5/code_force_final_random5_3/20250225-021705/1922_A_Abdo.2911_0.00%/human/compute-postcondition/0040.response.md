Output State: **`match_a_b` is `False`, `i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `template[i]` is not a lowercase letter, and we break out of the loop.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the loop, but it does not change the values of the variables `match_a_b`, `i`, `n`, or `template[i]`. Therefore, these variables retain their original conditions.
