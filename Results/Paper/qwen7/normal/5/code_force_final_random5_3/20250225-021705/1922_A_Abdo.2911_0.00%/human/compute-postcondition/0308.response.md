Postcondition: `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, and the character at index `i` in `template` is not lowercase. If the character at index `i` in `c` is equal to the character at the same index in `template` after converting both to lowercase, then `match_c` is False and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, no change occurs to the variables.
