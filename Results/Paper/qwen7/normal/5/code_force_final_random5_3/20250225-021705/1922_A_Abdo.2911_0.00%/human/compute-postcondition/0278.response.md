Output State: **`match_a_b` is False, `i` is `i + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block that `i` was part of. The values of `match_a_b` and `i` remain unchanged, and we indicate that the execution breaks out of the loop or conditional block.
