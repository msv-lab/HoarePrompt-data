Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n`, and `n` must be greater than 0.
- `match_c` is either `True` or `False`.
- The expression `(match_a_b and (not match_c))` is `False`.

We need to determine the output of the following code snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

Let's break it down:
- The value of `i` is `n`.
- Since `n` is greater than 0, `i` is also greater than 0.
- The value of `match_c` is irrelevant to the print statement because the print statement does not reference `match_c`.
- The condition `(match_a_b and (not match_c))` being `False` does not affect the print statement either.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output is:
Output: **NO**
