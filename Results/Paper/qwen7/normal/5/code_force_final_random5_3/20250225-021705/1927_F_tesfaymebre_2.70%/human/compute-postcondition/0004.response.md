Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The function `func_6()` is called, but since no changes are made to any variables within the function call itself (assuming `func_6()` does not modify `test_cases` or any other global variables), the value of `test_cases` remains unchanged. Therefore, the only information that remains valid is that `test_cases` must be greater than 0.
