Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires finding a simple cycle in an undirected weighted graph where the weight of the lightest edge in the cycle is minimal. The solution should handle multiple test cases and correctly identify such cycles.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1()**: Reads an integer from standard input, which is used to determine the number of test cases.
   - **func_2()**: Reads a line from standard input without splitting it, but it's not used in the provided code.
   - **func_3()**: Reads a line from standard input, splits it into space-separated integers, and returns the first integer.
   - **func_4()**: Reads a line from standard input, splits it into space-separated integers, and returns them as a list.
   - **func_5()**: Reads a line from standard input, splits it into space-separated strings, and returns them as a list.
   - **func_6()**: Constructs the graph, sorts edges in descending order, and uses DSU to find the MST. It then finds the cycle involving the minimum edge weight and performs a DFS to verify the cycle.
   - **dfs()**: Performs a DFS to find the cycle involving the minimum edge weight.
   - **func_7()**: Processes multiple test cases by calling `func_6()` for each test case.

3. **Verification**:
   - **Graph Construction**: The graph is constructed correctly using adjacency lists.
   - **Edge Sorting**: Edges are sorted in descending order, which helps in finding the MST efficiently.
   - **DSU Operations**: DSU operations are used to manage connected components and update the minimum edge weight.
   - **Cycle Finding**: The DFS function correctly identifies the cycle involving the minimum edge weight.
   - **Output Format**: The output format matches the required format, including the minimum edge weight, the number of vertices in the cycle, and the vertices themselves.

Based on the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
