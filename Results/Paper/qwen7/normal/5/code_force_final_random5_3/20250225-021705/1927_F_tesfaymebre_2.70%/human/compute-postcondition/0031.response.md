Output State: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are unvisited neighbors (color != 2) of the current vertex (`curr`) that are not the parent vertex. For each such neighbor, the DFS function is called recursively. If at any point the DFS call returns a non-empty result containing `node_v`, the function will return that result. If no such result is found after all possible paths are explored, the function will eventually return `None`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the output state will be determined by whether `node_v` was found in any of the DFS paths starting from the initial `curr` vertex and exploring through its neighbors, excluding the parent vertex, until all possible paths are exhausted. If `node_v` is found in any of these paths, the function will return that path (as a list of vertices). If `node_v` is not found in any path, the function will return `None`.
