Output State: **_min_edge is the minimum edge weight among all the edges connected to node_u; `node_u` is the value of `u` from the new first tuple in `edges`; `node_v` is the value of `v` from the new first tuple in `edges`; `parent_u` is the root node of `node_u` in the DSU structure; `parent_v` is the root node of `node_v` in the DSU structure; the DSU structure has united `node_u` and `node_v` under the same root node.**

Explanation: The code `_min_edge = dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` assigns the minimum edge weight among all the edges connected to `node_u` to the variable `_min_edge`. The values of `node_u`, `node_v`, `parent_u`, and `parent_v` remain unchanged, and the DSU structure still unites `node_u` and `node_v` under the same root node.
