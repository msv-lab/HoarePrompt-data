Postcondition: **`node_u` and `node_v` are updated according to the if condition. If `dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge`, then `node_v` is the value of `v` from the new first tuple in `edges`; otherwise, `node_v` remains unchanged. `parent_u` and `parent_v` are the root nodes of `node_u` and `node_v` in the DSU structure, and the DSU structure has united `node_u` and `node_v` under the same root node.**
