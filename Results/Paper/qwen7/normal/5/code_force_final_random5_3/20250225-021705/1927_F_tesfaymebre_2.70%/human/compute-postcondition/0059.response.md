Output State: **_min_edge is the minimum edge weight among all edges connected to node_u, parent_u is now the root node of node_u after union operation, parent_v is now the root node of node_v after union operation, node_u is u, node_v is v.**

The code `node_v = v` simply assigns the value of `v` to the variable `node_v`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged. The initial conditions for `_min_edge`, `parent_u`, `parent_v`, and `node_u` are still valid.
