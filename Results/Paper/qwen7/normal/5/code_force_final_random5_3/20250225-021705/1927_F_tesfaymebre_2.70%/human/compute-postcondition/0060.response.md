Postcondition: **`edges` is a non-empty list, `node_u` is the value of `u` from the new first tuple in `edges`, `node_v` is the value of `v` from the new first tuple in `edges`, `parent_u` is now the root node of `node_u` after union operation, `parent_v` is now the root node of `node_v` after union operation. If `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` is less than `_min_edge`, then `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight among all edges connected to `node_u`. Otherwise, `_min_edge` remains unchanged.**
