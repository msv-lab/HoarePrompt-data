Output State: **_min_edge is the minimum edge weight among all edges connected to node_u, parent_u is now the root node of node_u after union operation, parent_v is now the root node of node_v after union operation, node_u is u.**

Explanation: The code `node_u = u` assigns the value of `u` to the variable `node_u`. The other variables `_min_edge`, `parent_u`, and `parent_v` remain unchanged from their previous states.
