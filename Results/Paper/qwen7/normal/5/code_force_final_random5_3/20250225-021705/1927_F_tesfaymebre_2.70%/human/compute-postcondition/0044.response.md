Output State: **`edges` is a non-empty list, `node_u` is the value of `u` from the new first tuple in `edges`, `node_v` is the value of `v` from the new first tuple in `edges`, `parent_u` is the root node of `node_u` in the disjoint set union (DSU) structure, `parent_v` is the root node of `node_v` in the DSU structure.**

Explanation: The code `parent_v = dsu.find(v)` finds the root node of `node_v` in the DSU structure and assigns it to the variable `parent_v`. The values of `edges`, `node_u`, `node_v`, and `parent_u` remain unchanged.
