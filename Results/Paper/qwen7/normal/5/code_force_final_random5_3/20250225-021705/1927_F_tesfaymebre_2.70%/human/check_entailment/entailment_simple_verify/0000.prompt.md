You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges. There is at
most one edge between each pair of vertices in the graph, and the graph does
not contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). The graph is not
necessarily connected.

A cycle in the graph is called simple if it doesn't pass through the same
vertex twice and doesn't contain the same edge twice.

Find any simple cycle in this graph in which the weight of the lightest edge
is minimal.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (3 \le n \le m
\le \min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5) ) — the size of the graph and
the number of edges.

The next m lines of the test case contain three integers u , v , and w (1 \le
u, v \le n , u \ne v , 1 \le w \le 10^6 ) — vertices u and v are connected by
an edge of weight w .

It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices.
Note that under the given constraints, there is always at least one simple
cycle in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of m for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a pair of numbers b and k , where:

  * b — the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle, 
  * k — the number of vertices in the found cycle. 

On the next line, output k numbers from 1 to n — the vertices of the cycle in
traversal order.

Note that the answer always exists, as under the given constraints, there is
always at least one simple cycle in the graph.

    #In natural language: The output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that `test_cases` must still be greater than 0. This is because the loop continues to run as long as `test_cases` is greater than 0, and there is no operation within the loop that changes the value of `test_cases`. Therefore, if the loop runs for 1, 2, or 3 times, it implies that `test_cases` was initially greater than 0 and remained so throughout the loop's execution.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to find a simple cycle with the minimal weight of the lightest edge. However, there are a few issues that make the program incorrect:

1. **Handling of Graph Representation**: The graph is represented using an adjacency list, but the program does not ensure that the graph is undirected. Specifically, the program only adds the edge `(u, v)` to the graph, but not `(v, u)`. This could lead to incorrect results if the graph is not fully symmetric.

2. **Cycle Detection and Path Tracing**: The program uses a depth-first search (DFS) to trace the path and find the cycle. However, the DFS function `dfs` does not correctly handle the detection of cycles. It checks if the current node has already been visited (`colors[curr] == 1`), but it does not ensure that the cycle is simple (i.e., no repeated vertices).

3. **Union-Find Data Structure**: The union-find data structure (`DSU`) is used to find the minimum edge weight in the cycle. However, the implementation of `DSU` does not seem to correctly track the minimum edge weights for each component. The `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` might not always reflect the correct minimum edge weight in the component.

To illustrate a specific case where the program fails, consider the following graph:

```
3 3
1 2 1
2 3 2
3 1 3
```

The expected output should be a cycle with the minimum edge weight of 1 and 3 vertices. However, the program might fail to detect the correct cycle due to the issues mentioned above. For instance, the DFS might not correctly trace the cycle or might not handle the simple cycle condition properly.

Given these issues, the program does not guarantee correct behavior for all potential cases, hence the correctness is **False**.
