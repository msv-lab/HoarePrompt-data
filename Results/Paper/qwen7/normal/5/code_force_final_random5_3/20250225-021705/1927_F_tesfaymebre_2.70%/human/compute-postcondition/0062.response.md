Postcondition: **`edges` is a non-empty list, `node_u` is the value of `u` from the new first tuple in `edges`, `node_v` is the value of `v` from the new first tuple in `edges`, `parent_u` and `parent_v` are the root nodes of `node_u` and `node_v` respectively. If `parent_u` equals `parent_v`, `_min_edge` remains unchanged. Otherwise, the union operation has been performed between `u` and `v` with some weight `w`, and `_min_edge` is updated to be the minimum edge weight among all edges connected to `node_u`.**
