Postcondition: **The color of the vertex `curr` is 1, and `nei` is a valid neighbor of `curr` that meets the conditions `colors[nei] != 2` and `nei != parent`. If the result `res` of the dfs function call is not empty and `node_v` is in the set `set_res`, then the function returns the list `res`; otherwise, no change is made to the variables.**
