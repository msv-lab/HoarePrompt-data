The function processes a graph represented by vertices and weighted edges using a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure to find the minimum spanning tree (MST). It first constructs an adjacency list representation of the graph and sorts the edges in descending order of their weights. Then, it iteratively processes each edge, merging connected components and updating the minimum edge weight found so far. Finally, it performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from one of the nodes involved in the MST to determine the connected component size and prints the minimum edge weight along with the number of nodes in the DFS traversal.
