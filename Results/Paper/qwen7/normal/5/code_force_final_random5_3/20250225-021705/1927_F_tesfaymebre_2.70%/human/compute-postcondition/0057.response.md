Output State: **_min_edge is the minimum edge weight among all edges connected to node_u, parent_u is now the root node of node_u after union operation, parent_v is now the root node of node_v after union operation.**

Explanation: The code `_min_edge = dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` assigns the minimum edge weight among all edges connected to `node_u` (which is `parent_u`) to the variable `_min_edge`. The values of `node_u`, `node_v`, `parent_u`, and `parent_v` remain unchanged as they were not affected by this line of code.
