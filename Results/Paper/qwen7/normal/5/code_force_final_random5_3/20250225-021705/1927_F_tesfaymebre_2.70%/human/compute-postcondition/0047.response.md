Output State: **_min_edge is the minimum edge weight among all the edges connected to node_u; `node_u` is now `u` from the new first tuple in `edges`; `node_v` is the value of `v` from the new first tuple in `edges`; `parent_u` is the root node of `node_u` in the DSU structure; `parent_v` is the root node of `node_v` in the DSU structure; the DSU structure has united `node_u` and `node_v` under the same root node.**

Explanation: The code `node_u = u` simply assigns the value of `u` from the new first tuple in `edges` to the variable `node_u`. All other variables remain unchanged. The DSU structure's state (united nodes) also remains the same as before the assignment.
