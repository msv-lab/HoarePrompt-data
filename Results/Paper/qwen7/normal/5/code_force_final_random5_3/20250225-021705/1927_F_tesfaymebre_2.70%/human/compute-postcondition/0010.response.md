Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each representing an undirected weighted graph. It iterates through the specified number of test cases (stored in `test_cases`) and calls `func_6()` for each iteration. After completing all iterations, the function ensures that `test_cases` remains greater than 0, indicating that all specified test cases were successfully processed. The function does not return any value.**
