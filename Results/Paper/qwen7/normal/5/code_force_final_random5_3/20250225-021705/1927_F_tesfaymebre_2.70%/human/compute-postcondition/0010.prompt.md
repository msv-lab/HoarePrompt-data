You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is an integer representing the number of test cases, and each test case consists of an undirected weighted graph described by integers n, m, u, v, and w as specified in the problem description.
def func_7():
    test_cases = func_1()
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        func_6()
        
    #State: Output State: `test_cases` must be greater than 0.
    #
    #In natural language: The output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that `test_cases` must still be greater than 0. This is because the loop continues to run as long as `test_cases` is greater than 0, and there is no operation within the loop that changes the value of `test_cases`. Therefore, if the loop runs for 1, 2, or 3 times, it implies that `test_cases` was initially greater than 0 and remained so throughout the loop's execution.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter test_cases, which is an integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an undirected weighted graph described by integers n, m, u, v, and w. The function does not return any value explicitly mentioned in the given information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
