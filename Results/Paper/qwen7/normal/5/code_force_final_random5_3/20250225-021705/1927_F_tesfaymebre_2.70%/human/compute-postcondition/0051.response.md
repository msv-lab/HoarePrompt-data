Output State: **`edges` is a non-empty list, `node_u` is the value of `u` from the new first tuple in `edges`, `node_v` is the value of `v` from the new first tuple in `edges`, `parent_u` is updated to be the same as `parent_v` in the DSU structure, `parent_v` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The `dsu.union(u, v, w)` function call unites the sets containing `node_u` and `node_v` in the disjoint set union structure. This means that `parent_u` is updated to be the same as `parent_v`, while `parent_v` remains unchanged. The values of `edges`, `node_u`, and `node_v` remain the same as they were in the initial state.
