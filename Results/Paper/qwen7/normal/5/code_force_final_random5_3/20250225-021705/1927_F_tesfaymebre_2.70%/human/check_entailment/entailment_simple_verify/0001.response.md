### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the key steps and logic of the provided program. Let's break down the program and verify each step in detail:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of vertices (`n`) and edges (`m`), and then reads the edges with their weights.

2. **Graph Representation:**
   - The graph is represented using an adjacency list (`graph`).
   - Edges are stored in a list (`edges`).

3. **Sorting Edges:**
   - The edges are sorted in descending order of their weights using `edges.sort(reverse=True)`.

4. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU):**
   - A DSU (Disjoint Set Union) data structure is used to keep track of the minimum edge weight in each connected component.
   - The DSU is initialized with `dsu = DSU(n + 1)`.

5. **Finding Minimum Edge in a Cycle:**
   - The program iterates over the sorted edges in reverse order.
   - For each edge `(u, v, w)`, it checks if `u` and `v` belong to the same connected component.
   - If they do, it updates the minimum edge weight and stores the nodes involved in the cycle.
   - If they don't, it unites the components and continues.

6. **Cycle Detection and Path Tracing:**
   - After finding the minimum edge in a cycle, it uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to trace the path from one of the nodes (`node_u`) to the other (`node_v`).
   - The DFS function ensures that no node is visited more than once to avoid cycles within the cycle.

7. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum edge weight and the number of vertices in the cycle.
   - It also prints the vertices in traversal order.

### Detailed Verification

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles multiple test cases correctly.
  - It correctly sorts edges in descending order of weights.
  - It uses DSU to efficiently find connected components and update minimum edge weights.
  - The DFS function correctly traces the path without revisiting nodes.

- **Correctness:**
  - The program logic is sound and follows the problem requirements.
  - It correctly identifies the minimum-weight edge in a cycle and traces the path.

### Specific Points to Validate

1. **DSU Initialization and Operations:**
   - The DSU class is correctly implemented with `find` and `union` operations.
   - The `min_edge` attribute is updated correctly during the union operations.

2. **DFS Traversal:**
   - The DFS function correctly traces the path and avoids revisiting nodes.
   - The path is traced from `node_u` to `node_v`.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The output format matches the problem requirements.

### Conclusion

After reviewing the program and the annotated code, the original assessment accurately describes the program's behavior and logic. The program correctly implements the solution for the given problem.
