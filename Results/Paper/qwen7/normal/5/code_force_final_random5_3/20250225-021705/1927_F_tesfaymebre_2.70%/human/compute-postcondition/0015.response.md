Postcondition: `curr` is an integer representing the current vertex being visited, `parent` is an integer representing the previously visited vertex, `path` is a list representing the current path of vertices being explored with `curr` appended to it, the color of the vertex `curr` is now 1, `nei` is an integer representing a valid neighbor of `curr`, `graph[curr]` has at least one neighbor, the color of `nei` is not 2, and `nei` is not equal to `parent`; if the condition `colors[nei] != 2 and nei != parent` is true, the result of the dfs function call is stored in `res`, and either `res` is an empty set or `node_v` is not in `res`.
