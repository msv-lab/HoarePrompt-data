Output State: All nodes in the graph will be merged into connected components, and `node_u` and `node_v` will hold the values of the nodes that form the minimum spanning tree (MST) of the graph. Specifically, `node_u` and `node_v` will point to the two nodes that have the smallest edge weight among all the edges that were processed during the loop. The `dsu.min_edge` attribute will reflect the minimum edge weight within the connected component that `node_u` belongs to, and `_min_edge` will hold the overall minimum edge weight found during the entire execution of the loop.
