Output State: All nodes will be grouped into disjoint sets (connected components) based on the union-find operations performed during the loop execution. The variables `node_u` and `node_v` will hold the values of the last `u` and `v` that were processed before the loop terminates. `_min_edge` will contain the weight of the minimum edge among all the edges that connect any node in the final set of connected components. If there are no edges left in the `edges` list, `node_u` and `node_v` will be the values of the last `u` and `v` from the `edges` list, and `_min_edge` will retain its last updated value or remain unchanged if no further updates occurred.
