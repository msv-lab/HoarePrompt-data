Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but uses a pre-defined DSU data structure, a tuple (n, m) where 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(⌊n(n - 1)/2⌋, 2 * 10^5), and a list of tuples edges where each tuple (u, v, w) represents an edge between vertices u and v with weight w. The function returns information based on the minimum edge found using the DSU data structure.**

This means the function utilizes a pre-existing DSU data structure along with a range of integers (n, m) and a list of weighted edges to determine and return specific information, likely related to the minimum edge in the graph represented by the edges, considering the disjoint sets formed by the DSU.
