Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `curr` is an integer representing the current vertex being visited; `parent` is an integer representing the previously visited vertex; `path` is a list representing the current path of vertices being explored with `curr` appended to it; the color of the vertex `curr` is now 1.
Code of the loop:
for nei in graph[curr]:
    if colors[nei] != 2 and nei != parent:
        res = dfs(nei, curr, path)
        set_res = set(res)
        if res and node_v in set_res:
            return res


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `curr` is an integer representing the current vertex being visited, `parent` is an integer representing the previously visited vertex, `path` is a list representing the current path of vertices being explored with `curr` appended to it, the color of the vertex `curr` is now 1, `nei` is an integer representing a valid neighbor of `curr`, `graph[curr]` has at least one neighbor, the color of `nei` is not 2, and `nei` is not equal to `parent`; if the condition `colors[nei] != 2 and nei != parent` is true, the result of the dfs function call is stored in `res`, and either `res` is an empty set or `node_v` is not in `res`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The color of the vertex `curr` remains 1, `nei` is a valid neighbor of `curr` that meets the conditions `colors[nei] != 2` and `nei != parent`. If the result `res` of the dfs function call is not empty and `node_v` is in the set `set_res`, then the function returns the list `res`; otherwise, no change is made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `set_res` is the set of results from the DFS calls. If `node_v` is in `set_res`, the program returns the result of `dfs(nei, curr, path)`. Otherwise, the program returns `None`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
