Output State: **`edges` is a non-empty list, `node_u` is the value of `u` from the new first tuple in `edges`, `node_v` is the value of `v` from the new first tuple in `edges`, `parent_u` is the root node of `node_u` in the DSU structure, `parent_v` is now the root node of `node_v` in the DSU structure found by the `dsu.find(v)` method.**

Explanation: The code `parent_v = dsu.find(v)` finds the root node of `node_v` in the DSU (Disjoint Set Union) structure and assigns it to `parent_v`. The other variables remain unchanged.
