Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `edges` is a non-empty list.
   - `node_u` is the value of `u` from the new first tuple in `edges`.
   - `node_v` is the value of `v` from the new first tuple in `edges`.
   - `parent_u` and `parent_v` are the root nodes of `node_u` and `node_v` in the DSU structure.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over each tuple `(w, u, v)` in `edges`.

3. **Loop Body**:
   - `w` is the weight of the edge.
   - `u` is the source node.
   - `v` is the destination node.
   - If `parent_u` equals `parent_v`:
     - Update `node_v` based on the condition: if `dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge`, then `node_v` is the value of `v` from the new first tuple in `edges`; otherwise, `node_v` remains unchanged.
     - Unite `parent_u` and `parent_v` under the same root node.
   - If `parent_u` does not equal `parent_v`:
     - Update `parent_u` to be the same as `parent_v` in the DSU structure.

4. **State After the Loop Iteration**:
   - The first tuple in `edges` is processed, and the corresponding changes are made to `node_u`, `node_v`, `parent_u`, and `parent_v`.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, the next tuple in `edges` will be processed.
   - The first tuple in `edges` is now the second tuple, and `node_u` and `node_v` will be updated accordingly.

Given this information, let's determine the state at the start of the next iteration:

- `edges` will still be a non-empty list, but it will now contain the remaining tuples after the first one has been processed.
- `node_u` will be the value of `u` from the new first tuple in `edges`.
- `node_v` will be the value of `v` from the new first tuple in `edges`.
- `parent_u` and `parent_v` will be the root nodes of `node_u` and `node_v` in the DSU structure, which may have changed based on the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`edges` is a non-empty list, `node_u` is the value of `u` from the new first tuple in `edges`, `node_v` is the value of `v` from the new first tuple in `edges`, `parent_u` and `parent_v` are the root nodes of `node_u` and `node_v` in the DSU structure.**
