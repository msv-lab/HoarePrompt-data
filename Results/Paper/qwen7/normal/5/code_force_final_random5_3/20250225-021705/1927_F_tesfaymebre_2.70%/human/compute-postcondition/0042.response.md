Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `edges` is a non-empty list.
- `node_u` is the value of `u` from the first tuple in `edges`.
- `node_v` is the value of `v` from the first tuple in `edges`.
- If `parent_u` is equal to `parent_v`, then:
  - `parent_v` is updated to be the same as `parent_u`.
  - `parent_u` remains unchanged.
  - If `dsu.min_edge[parent_u]` is less than `_min_edge`, then `node_v` is updated to be the value of `v` from the first tuple in `edges`.
- Otherwise:
  - `parent_v` is updated to be the same as `parent_u`.
  - `parent_u` is not equal to the original `parent_v`.

### Loop Head
The loop iterates over each tuple `(w, u, v)` in `edges`.

### Adjusting States for the Next Iteration
- The loop will proceed to the next tuple in `edges`.
- Therefore, `edges` will now contain the remaining tuples after the first one.

### Updated States
- `edges` will now be a list containing all tuples except the first one.
- `node_u` will be the value of `u` from the new first tuple in `edges`.
- `node_v` will be the value of `v` from the new first tuple in `edges`.

### Final State
- `edges` is now a non-empty list (since it still contains at least one tuple).
- `node_u` is the value of `u` from the new first tuple in `edges`.
- `node_v` is the value of `v` from the new first tuple in `edges`.

### Conclusion
State: **`edges` is a non-empty list, `node_u` is the value of `u` from the new first tuple in `edges`, `node_v` is the value of `v` from the new first tuple in `edges`**.
