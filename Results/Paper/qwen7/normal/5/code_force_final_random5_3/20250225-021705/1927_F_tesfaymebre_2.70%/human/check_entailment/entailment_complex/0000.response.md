### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Purpose**:
   - **func_1**: Reads an integer from standard input.
   - **func_2**: Reads a line from standard input and returns it as a string.
   - **func_3**: Reads a line from standard input, splits it into integers, and returns the first integer.
   - **func_4**: Reads a line from standard input, splits it into integers, and returns a list of integers.
   - **func_5**: Reads a line from standard input, splits it into strings, and returns a list of strings.
   - **func_6**: Constructs a graph from the input, finds the minimum spanning tree (MST) using DSU, and performs a DFS to find the minimum weight cycle.
   - **dfs**: Performs a depth-first search to find a cycle involving the minimum weight edge.
   - **func_7**: Processes multiple test cases by calling `func_6` for each test case.

2. **Graph Construction and MST Finding**:
   - **func_6** constructs an adjacency list representation of the graph and sorts the edges in descending order of their weights.
   - It uses a DSU to merge connected components and keeps track of the minimum edge weight within each component.
   - The minimum spanning tree (MST) is effectively constructed by processing the edges in decreasing order of weight, ensuring that the first time a cycle is formed, it is the one with the minimum edge weight.

3. **Cycle Detection and Path Finding**:
   - After constructing the MST, **func_6** performs a DFS to find a path that includes the minimum weight edge and forms a cycle.
   - The DFS ensures that the path is a simple cycle by avoiding revisiting vertices.

4. **Output**:
   - The function correctly outputs the minimum weight of the edge in the cycle and the number of vertices in the cycle, followed by the vertices in traversal order.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the constraints and guarantees provided in the problem statement, ensuring that there is always at least one simple cycle in the graph.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to find a simple cycle with the minimum weight edge in an undirected weighted graph. All functions work together to achieve the desired outcome as per the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
