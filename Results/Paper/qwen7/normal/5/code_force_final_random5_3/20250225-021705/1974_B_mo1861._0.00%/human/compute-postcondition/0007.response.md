Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `c`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over the sorted set of `b`. The `enumerate` function provides both the index `i` and the element `c` from the sorted set.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `b` is a list or iterable with at least one unique element.
   - `char_map` is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is `c` and the value is a character calculated as `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the index in the sorted set, and `c` is the corresponding element, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - The new `c` will be the next element in the sorted set.

5. **Update the `char_map`**:
   - The value in `char_map` corresponding to the current `c` is `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`, so the new value will be `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - (i + 1) - 1)) = chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 2))`.

6. **Construct the new state**:
   - `b` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `char_map` should now include the new key-value pair where the key is the next `c` and the value is the updated character.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`b` is a list or iterable with at least one unique element; `char_map` is a dictionary with a key-value pair where the key is the next element in the sorted set of `b` and the value is a character calculated as `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 2))`**.
