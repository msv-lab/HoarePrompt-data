Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `b` and the string `b` itself.
3. The function `func_1` is responsible for decoding the string `b`:
   - It creates a `char_map` dictionary that maps each unique character in `b` to its corresponding character in the reversed order of the alphabet.
   - It iterates through each character in `b`, uses the `char_map` to find the corresponding character, and builds the decoded string `s`.
4. The logic in `func_1` correctly reverses the encoding process described in the problem statement. Each character in `b` is mapped back to its original position in the sorted unique characters of the original string `s`.
5. The function returns the decoded string `s`.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the decoding logic as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
