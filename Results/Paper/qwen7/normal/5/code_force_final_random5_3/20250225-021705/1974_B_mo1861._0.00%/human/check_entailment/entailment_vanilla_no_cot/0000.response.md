Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly decodes the encoded string `b` by first creating a mapping from each unique character in `b` to its corresponding character in the auxiliary string `r`. The auxiliary string `r` is constructed by sorting the unique characters of `b` in alphabetical order. Each character in `b` is then replaced by its symmetric counterpart from `r`, effectively decoding the string. The function `func_1` implements this logic accurately, and the main loop processes each test case as specified. Therefore, the program is correct based on the given problem description.
