State: **`char_map` is unchanged, `s` is an empty string, `c` must be initialized to the first element of `b`, `b` must be a non-empty iterable**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop iterates over each character `c` in the iterable `b`.
2. For the loop to execute, `b` must contain at least one element because the loop starts with the first element of `b`.
3. The variable `c` will take the value of the first element of `b` during the first iteration of the loop.
4. The state of `char_map` and `s` (which is an empty string) does not affect whether the loop can execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `c` to be initialized to the first element of `b`, and `b` to be a non-empty iterable.
