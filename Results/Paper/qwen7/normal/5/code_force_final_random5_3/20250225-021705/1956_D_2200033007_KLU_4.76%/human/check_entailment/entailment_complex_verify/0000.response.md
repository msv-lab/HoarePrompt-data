### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not implement the logic required to solve the problem. The program hardcodes the output based on the length of the array, which is incorrect. Let's break down the issues and verify the program's behavior using the annotated code.

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the length of the array `n` and then reads the array elements into the list `a`. This part is correct.

2. **Function Call**: The function `func_1(len(a))` is called with the length of the array `a`. The function `func_1` then prints hardcoded values based on the length of the array `c`.

   - If `c == 2`, it prints `4 1` and `1 2`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `13 0`.

Let's analyze the examples provided in the problem description:

- **Example 1**: Input: `2\n0 1`
  - Output: `4 1\n1 2`
  - The program outputs the hardcoded values, which are correct for this specific case.

- **Example 2**: Input: `3\n1 3 9`
  - Output: `13 0`
  - The program outputs the hardcoded values, which are correct for this specific case.

- **Example 3**: Input: `4\n1 100 2 1`
  - Output: `105 2\n3 3\n3 4`
  - The program outputs the hardcoded values, which are incorrect for this case. The correct output should be `105 2` with the operations `3 3` and `3 4`.

- **Example 4**: Input: `1\n0`
  - Output: `1 1`
  - The program outputs the hardcoded values, which are incorrect for this case. The correct output should be `1 1`.

Given these observations, the program does not correctly handle the problem for general cases. It does not perform the necessary operations to maximize the sum of the array elements. Instead, it relies on hardcoded values based on the length of the array, which is insufficient and incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. It hardcodes the output based on the length of the array, which is not sufficient to handle all possible inputs and does not maximize the sum of the array elements.
