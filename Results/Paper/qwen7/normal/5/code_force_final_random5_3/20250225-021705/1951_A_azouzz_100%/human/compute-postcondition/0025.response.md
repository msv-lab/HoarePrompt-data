Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`. If the count of '1' in `s` is greater than 2, then `cnt1` remains greater than 2. If the count of '1' in `s` is less than or equal to 2, it remains even unless it is exactly 1, in which case it remains 1. Additionally, if the string `s` contains the substring '11', the count of '1' becomes at least 2.
