Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `s`, and `cnt1`) remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 is still valid. The value of `n` is now an integer obtained from the user's input.
