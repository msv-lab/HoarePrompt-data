Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`. The count of '1' in `s` is less than or equal to 2. If the count of '1' is exactly 1, it remains 1. If the count of '1' is 0 or 2, it either stays even or becomes at least 2 if the string `s` contains the substring '11'.
