Output State: **`loop` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `loop` ≤ 500.**

Explanation: The code `loop = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `loop`. The initial conditions for `t` and the constraints involving `n`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged. The only variable affected is `loop`, which is now an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.
