Output State: **`max(big)` must be less than `min(less)`, `i` is `max(big) + 1`, `num` is `max(big) + 1`, and `i` (which is equal to `num` and `i`) is not in `no`.**

Explanation: The code `num = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `num`. Since `i` was previously defined as `max(big) + 1`, `num` now also holds the value `max(big) + 1`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
