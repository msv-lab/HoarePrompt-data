Output State: **`num` is 0, `prev_iterable` is equal to `innerLoop`, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is `innerLoop`, `iterable` is `innerLoop`, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `less` is either an empty list or a list containing `a`, `big` is a list containing `a`, `no` is either an empty list or a list containing the value of `a`, `x` is an integer equal to the first input integer.**

Explanation: The code `big.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `big`. Since `big` was either an empty list or a list containing `a`, after appending `a`, `big` becomes a list containing `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
