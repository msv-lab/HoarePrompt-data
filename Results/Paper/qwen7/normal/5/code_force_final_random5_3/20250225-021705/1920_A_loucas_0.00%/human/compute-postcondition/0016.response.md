Output State: **`iterable2` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `no` is a list containing `a`**

Explanation: The line `no.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the list `no`. Since `no` was not defined before, it is assumed to be a list. The values of `iterable2`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged.
