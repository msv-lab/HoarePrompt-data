Output State: **`num` is 0, `prev_iterable` is equal to `innerLoop`, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is `innerLoop`, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list, `no` is an empty list**.

Explanation: The line `num = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `num`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
