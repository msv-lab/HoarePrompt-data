Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and the range bounds defined by `max(big)` and `min(less)`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range defined by `max(big)` and `min(less)`. 

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is an integer.
   - `no` is a set of integers.
   - If `i` is not in `no`, the loop continues without any changes to the variables.
   - If `i` is in `no`, the loop breaks.

4. **Consider the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be within the range defined by `max(big)` and `min(less)`.
   - Since `i` is incremented in each iteration (or decremented, depending on the order of `max(big)` and `min(less)`), we need to ensure that `i` is still within this range.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - The value of `i` will increase by 1 (or decrease by 1, depending on the order of `max(big)` and `min(less)`).
   - The set `no` remains unchanged unless `i` is in `no`, in which case the loop would break and no further changes would be made to the variables.

Given these considerations, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `i` while ensuring it is still within the range defined by `max(big)` and `min(less)`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is an integer that is within the range defined by `max(big)` and `min(less)`, `no` is a set of integers**.
