Output State: **`max(big)` must be less than `min(less)`, `num` is `max(big) + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables. It simply exits the current context. Therefore, the values of `max(big)`, `less`, `num`, and `i` remain unchanged, and we know that `i` (which is equal to `num`) is not in `no`.
