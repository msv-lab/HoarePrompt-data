Output State: **`num` is 0, `prev_iterable` is equal to `innerLoop`, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is `innerLoop`, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `less` is an empty list, `big` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `big`. No changes are made to the values of `num`, `prev_iterable`, `innerLoop`, `iterable`, `iterable2`, or `less`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial values and states.
