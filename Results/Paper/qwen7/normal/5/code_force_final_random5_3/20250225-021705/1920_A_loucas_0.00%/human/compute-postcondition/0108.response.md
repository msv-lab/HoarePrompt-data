The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `max(big)`, and `min(less)`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables.

At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition is that `i` is an integer within the range defined by `max(big)` and `min(less)`. If `i` is not in the set `no`, then `i` is equal to `num` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is in the set `no`, no specific changes are made to `num` and we do not break out of the loop or if statement.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and still remain within the range defined by `max(big)` and `min(less)`. Since `i` is within this range at the end of the previous iteration, it will still be within the range after incrementing by 1, as long as `max(big)` is less than `min(less)`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `max(big)` is the same, `min(less)` is the same**
