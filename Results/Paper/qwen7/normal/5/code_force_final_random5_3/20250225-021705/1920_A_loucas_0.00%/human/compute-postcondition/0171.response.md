Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of constraints through its execution. It returns a result based on the given constraints where each constraint is described by two integers (a, x) with specific conditions. The function ensures that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, and all constraints are unique.**
