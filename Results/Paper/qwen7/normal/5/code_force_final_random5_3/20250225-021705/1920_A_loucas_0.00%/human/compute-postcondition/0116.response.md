Output State: **`num` is 0, `prev_iterable` is equal to `innerLoop`, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is `innerLoop`, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `less` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `less`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `num`, `prev_iterable`, `innerLoop`, `iterable`, and `iterable2` remain unchanged.
