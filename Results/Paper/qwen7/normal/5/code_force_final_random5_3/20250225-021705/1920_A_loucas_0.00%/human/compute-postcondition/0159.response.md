Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and the range defined by `max(big)` and `min(less)`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over the range starting from `max(big)` up to but not including `min(less)`.

3. **Determine the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is such that `max(big)` must be less than `min(less)`, and `i` (which is equal to `num` and `i`) is not in `no`.

4. **Analyze the loop execution**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `min(less)`. Since `i` starts from `max(big)` and increments by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `i` would be `max(big) + 1`.

5. **Adjust the state**: We need to update the state to reflect the next value of `i` and ensure that `i` is still within the range defined by `max(big)` and `min(less)`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` should be updated to `max(big) + 1`.
- The condition `max(big) < min(less)` must still hold true.
- `i` (which is equal to `num` and `i`) should not be in `no`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`max(big)` must be less than `min(less)`, `i` is `max(big) + 1`, and `i` (which is equal to `num` and `i`) is not in `no`**.
