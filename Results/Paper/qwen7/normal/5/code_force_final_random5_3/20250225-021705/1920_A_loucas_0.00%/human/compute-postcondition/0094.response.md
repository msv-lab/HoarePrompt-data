Postcondition: **`x` is an input integer, `a` is an integer derived from splitting the input and converting it to an integer. If `x` equals 1, `a` is appended to the list `big`. Otherwise, `a` is appended to either the `less` list or the `no` list. `iterable2` is 2, and `innerLoop` is greater than 0.**
