Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for finding the minimum number of coins required to travel between two cities. Specifically, the program attempts to precompute the number of steps required to reach the closest city from each city using two dictionaries `d1` and `d2`. However, this approach does not accurately capture the minimum cost for each query because it does not account for the optimal path that may involve multiple steps to reach the closest city before moving to the destination city.

For instance, consider the example provided in the problem statement:
- Cities are located at points `[0, 8, 12, 15, 20]`.
- Queries are `(1, 4)` and `(1, 5)`.

The program incorrectly calculates the number of steps to reach the closest city and then uses these values to determine the minimum cost for each query. This leads to incorrect results. For example, for the query `(1, 4)`, the program might incorrectly calculate the cost as 3 instead of the optimal cost of 1.

A correct solution would involve dynamically determining the minimum cost for each query by considering the optimal path, which may involve traveling to the closest city first and then to the destination city.
