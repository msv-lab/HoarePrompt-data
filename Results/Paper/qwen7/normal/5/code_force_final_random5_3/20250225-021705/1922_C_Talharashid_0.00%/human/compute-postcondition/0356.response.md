Postcondition: `i` is 4, `t` is the same, `m` must be greater than 3, `end` must be different from 3, `s` is the sum of 1 and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]` (with an additional 1 in the if part), `start` is 3, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where `d1[0]` is `s + abs(lst[3] - lst[2])`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `inc` is 1, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and 11111111, and `d1[start]` is either `s + 1` or `s + abs(lst[3] - lst[2])` depending on whether `mini` equals `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`. If `mini` equals `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `s` is `s + 1`; otherwise, `s` is updated to `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`.
