Output State: **`i` is 5, `m` is greater than 3, `end` is decreased by 1, `s` is 0, `s1` is abs(d1[end] - d1[start])**.

The code assigns the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]` to `s1`. However, since `start` is not defined in the initial state and the values of `d1[end]` and `d1[start]` are not provided, `s1` is expressed as `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
