Output State: **`i` is 4, `t` is the same, `m` must be greater than 3, `end` is the length of `lst` - 1, `s` is 0, `start` is 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `lst` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

The code `end = len(lst) - 1` updates the value of `end` to be one less than the current length of the list `lst`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
