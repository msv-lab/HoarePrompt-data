Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `start != end`.
2. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables involved in the loop head are `start` and `end`.

Given the current state:
- `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini`.
- `i` is either 1 or 2.
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `d1[start]` is updated to `s`.
- `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory int.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `lst` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `end` is `len(lst) - 1`.
- `s` is updated to either `s + 1` or `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`.
- `start` is incremented by `inc` and becomes equal to `start + inc`.
- `start` is less than `end` if `start + inc < len(lst)`.
- `start - 1` is greater than -1.

To ensure the loop executes one more time, the condition `start != end` must be true. This means `start` should not be equal to `end`.

Since `end` is fixed as `len(lst) - 1` and cannot be changed, the only variable that can change to satisfy the condition is `start`.

Therefore, we need to ensure that `start` is not equal to `end`. Given the constraints, `start` must be less than `end`.

So, the state needs to be adjusted such that `start` is less than `end`.

**State:**
**`mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini`, `i` is either 1 or 2, `t` must be greater than 0, `d1[start]` is updated to `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory int, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `s` is updated to either `s + 1` or `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `start` is incremented by `inc` and becomes equal to `start + inc`, and `start` must be less than `end`.**
