Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < m`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `start` is `start` - 1
   - `end` is an input integer - 1
   - `inc` is -1
   - `mini` is the minimum distance found during the entire loop execution
   - `s` is either `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])` or `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])`
   - `i` is 0
   - `m` is the input integer `m`
   - `s2` is either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` or `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`.
   - The value of `m` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`start` is `start` - 1, `end` is an input integer - 1, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum distance found during the entire loop execution, `s` is either `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])` or `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])`, `i` is 1, `m` is the input integer `m`, `s2` is either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` or `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`**
