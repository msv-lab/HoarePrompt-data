Postcondition: `end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `start` must be greater than 0, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the original `mini`, `start` + 1 is less than the length of `lst`, and if `start - 1` is greater than -1, `mini` is updated to be the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the original `mini`. Additionally, if `mini` equals `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `s` is `start` + 1; otherwise, `s` is increased by `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`.
