Output State: **`mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini`; `start` is `start + inc`; `end` is unchanged; `inc` is unchanged; `s` is updated to `d1[start] = s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`; `i` is unchanged; `m` is unchanged; `d2` is unchanged; `s2` is unchanged; `s1` is unchanged; `n` is unchanged; `lst` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])` to `d1[start]`. Since `s` was previously either increased by 1 or updated to `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, here it is explicitly updated to this new value. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
