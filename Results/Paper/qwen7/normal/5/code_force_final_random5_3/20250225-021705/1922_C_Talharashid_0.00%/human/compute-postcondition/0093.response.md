Output State: **`end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `start` must be greater than 0, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the original `mini`, `start` + 1 is less than the length of `lst`, and if `start - 1` is greater than -1, `mini` is updated to be the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the original `mini`, `s` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The line `s += 1` increments the value of `s` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
