To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `start` and `end`.

According to the loop condition `while start != end:`:

- The loop will continue to execute as long as `start` is not equal to `end`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `start` is now equal to `len(lst) - 2`.
- `end` is 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `start` must become equal to `end`. Given that `start` is currently `len(lst) - 2` and `end` is 0, `start` needs to be adjusted to 0.

No other states need to be adjusted since they are not part of the loop head conditions.

State: **`inc` is -1, `start` is 0, `end` is 0, `mini` is updated to be the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini`, `s` is either 1 or the sum of `s` and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `i` remains unchanged from its initial value, `m` remains unchanged from its initial state, `d1` is a dictionary where keys are indices from `start` to `end` and values are cumulative sums of distances up to those indices, `d2[start]` is equal to `s`, `d2` remains unchanged from its initial state except for the entry at index `start`, `s2` remains unchanged from its initial state, `s1` remains unchanged from its initial state, `n` remains unchanged from its initial value, `lst` remains unchanged from its initial state, and `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst`.**
