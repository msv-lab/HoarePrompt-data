Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `start != end`.
2. **Current state before the loop**: 
   - `end` is 0
   - `inc` is -1
   - `s` is 0 (though this variable is not involved in the loop condition)
3. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**: For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `start != end` must be true.
4. **Analyze the current values**:
   - Since `end` is currently 0, for the loop to execute, `start` must be different from 0.
5. **Adjust the necessary state**: The only variable involved in the loop condition is `start`. Therefore, `start` must be different from 0.

Given these steps, the state that needs to be adjusted is `start` must be different from 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `start` must be different from 0**
