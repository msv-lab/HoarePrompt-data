Output State: **`mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini`, `i` is either 1 or 2, `t` must be greater than 0, `d1[start]` is `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory int, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `s` is updated to either `s + 1` or `s + abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`, `start` is incremented by `inc` and becomes equal to `start + inc`, and `start` is less than `end` if `start + inc < len(lst)`, and `start - 1` is greater than -1.**

Explanation: The code `start += inc` increments the value of `start` by `inc`. The other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state. The condition `start` is less than `end` if `start + inc < len(lst)` and `start - 1` is greater than -1 are still valid.
