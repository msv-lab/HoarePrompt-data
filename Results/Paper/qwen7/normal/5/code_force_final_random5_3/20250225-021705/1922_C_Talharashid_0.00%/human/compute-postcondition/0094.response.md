Output State: **`end` is 0, `inc` is -1, `start` must be greater than 0, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the original `mini`, `start` + 1 is less than the length of `lst`, and if `start - 1` is greater than -1, `mini` is updated to be the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the original `mini`, `s` is increased by `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + inc])`**.

Explanation: The code increments `s` by the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`. Since `inc` is -1, this means `s` is increased by the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]`. The conditions and values of other variables remain unchanged.
