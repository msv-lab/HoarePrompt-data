Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 4.
- `m` is greater than 4.
- `start` is 3.
- `s` is 0.
- `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[3]` if `start < end`, otherwise it is the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]`.
- `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` if `start < end`, otherwise it is the absolute difference between `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`.

To determine the values of `s1` and `s2`, we need to consider the conditions given:

1. Since `start` is 3, and we don't have the explicit value of `end`, let's assume `end` is a variable that could be any index. However, the conditions for `s1` and `s2` depend on whether `start < end` or `start >= end`.

2. If `end > start` (i.e., `end > 3`), then:
   - `s1 = abs(d1[end] - d1[3])`
   - `s2 = abs(d2[start] - d2[end])`

3. If `end <= start` (i.e., `end <= 3`), then:
   - `s1 = abs(d2[end] - d2[start])`
   - `s2 = abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`

Given the conditions, we need to find the minimum of `s1` and `s2`. However, without the actual values of `d1` and `d2`, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `s1` and `s2`.

Therefore, the output will be the minimum of `s1` and `s2` based on the conditions described above.

Output: **min(abs(d1[end] - d1[3]), abs(d2[start] - d2[end])) if end > start, otherwise min(abs(d2[end] - d2[start]), abs(d1[start] - d1[end]))**
