Output State: **`i` is 4, `t` is the same, `m` must be greater than 3, `end` must be different from 3, `s` is the sum of 1 and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]`, `start` is 3, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where `d1[0]` is `s + abs(lst[3] - lst[2])`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `inc` is 1, `mini` is 11111111, `d1[start]` is `s**.

Explanation: The line `mini = 11111111` simply assigns the value 11111111 to the variable `mini`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `i`, `t`, `m`, `end`, `s`, `start`, `d1`, `d2`, `inc`, and the specific entries in `d1` remain unchanged from their initial states.
