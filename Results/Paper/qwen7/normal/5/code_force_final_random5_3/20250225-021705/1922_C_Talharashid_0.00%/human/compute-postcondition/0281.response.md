Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `end` is `end - 1`, `s` is 0, `start` is `start - 1`, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` based on whether `start < end` is true or false.**

Explanation: The code `end -= 1` decrements the value of `end` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `end` being decreased by 1, while `i`, `m`, `s`, `start`, `s1`, and `s2` retain their original conditions and values.
