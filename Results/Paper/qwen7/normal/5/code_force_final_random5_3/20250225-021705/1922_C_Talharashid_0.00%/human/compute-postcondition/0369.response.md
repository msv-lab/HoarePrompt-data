Postcondition: `i` is 4, `t` is the same, `m` must be greater than 3, `end` is 0, `s` is 0, `start` is now equal to `len(lst) - 1` and `len(lst)` must be greater than 1, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where `d1[start]` is `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `inc` is -1, `mini` is 11111111, and the current value of `start` is less than `len(lst)`.
