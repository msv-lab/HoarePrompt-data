Postcondition: `i` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory int, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory int, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `s` is 0, `start` must be different from `end`, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` and the original `mini`, `start` is less than `end` if `start + 1 < len(lst)`, and the current value of `start` is greater than -1.
