Postcondition: `start` is increased by `inc` and must not be equal to `end`; `mini` is the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `11111111`. If `start - 1 > -1`, then `mini` is updated to `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` if it is smaller than `11111111`. Otherwise, `mini` remains unchanged.
