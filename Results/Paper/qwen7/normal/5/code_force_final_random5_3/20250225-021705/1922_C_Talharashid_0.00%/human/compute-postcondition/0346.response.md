Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `start != end`.
2. **Current states at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 4
   - `t` is the same (unchanged from the previous iteration)
   - `m` must be greater than 3
   - `end` is the length of `lst` - 1 and must be greater than 0
   - `s` is the sum of 1 and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]`
   - `start` is 3
   - `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where `d1[0]` is `s + abs(lst[3] - lst[2])`
   - `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`
   - `inc` is 1
   - `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `11111111`
   - `d1[start]` is `s`

3. **Determine which states need adjustment**:
   - The loop condition `start != end` depends on the values of `start` and `end`.
   - `start` is currently 3.
   - `end` is the length of `lst` - 1 and must be greater than 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `start` must be different from `end`. Since `start` is currently 3, `end` must be different from 3 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - We need to ensure that `end` is not equal to 3.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `end`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 4, `t` is the same, `m` must be greater than 3, `end` must be different from 3, `s` is the sum of 1 and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]`, `start` is 3, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where `d1[0]` is `s + abs(lst[3] - lst[2])`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `inc` is 1, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `11111111`, `d1[start]` is `s**
