Output State: **`s` is increased by 1, `mini` is the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`, `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])`, and 11111111.**

The value of `s` is incremented by 1, while the value of `mini` remains unchanged as the code does not affect its calculation. The precondition that `mini` is the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`, `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])`, and 11111111 is still valid.
