Output State: **`inc` is -1, `start` is 0, `end` is 0, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[0] - lst[1])` and `11111111`, `s` is the sum of `s` and `1` or `abs(lst[0] - lst[1])` plus `abs(lst[-1] - lst[-2])` plus `abs(lst[1] - lst[0])`, `i` remains unchanged from its initial value, `m` is an input integer, `d1[start]` is equal to `mini`, `d2[start]` is equal to `s`, `d2` remains unchanged from its initial state except for the entry at index `-1`, which is now `mini`, `s2` remains unchanged from its initial state, `s1` remains unchanged from its initial state, `n` remains unchanged from its initial value, `lst` remains unchanged from its initial state.**

Explanation: The variable `m` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input()` reads an input from the user and `int()` converts it to an integer. Since the other variables (`inc`, `start`, `end`, `mini`, `s`, `i`, `d1`, `d2`, `s2`, `s1`, `n`, and `lst`) are not affected by this line of code, their states remain unchanged.
