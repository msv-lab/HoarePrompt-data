Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < m`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `m` must be greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop continues as long as `i < m`, after one iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 1.
   - The value of `m` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no such modification is mentioned, `m` stays the same.

Given these points, we can now update the states:

- `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
- `m` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration (greater than 0).

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `end` is `end - 1`, `s` is 0, and either `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])` and `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])`, or `s1` is `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` and `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` based on whether `start < end` is true or false.**
