Postcondition: `i` is 4, `t` remains the same, `m` must be greater than 3, `end` is 0, `s` is either 3 or `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]) + 1`, `start` must be at least 1 less than `end`, `d1` and `d2` are defaultdicts with default factory `int` where `d1[start]` and `d2[start]` are either `s`, which is 3 or `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]) + 1`, `inc` is -1, `mini` is `min(abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1]), mini)`.

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts, ensuring that the final state of the variables adheres to the conditions specified in each case.
