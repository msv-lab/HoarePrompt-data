Output State: `i` is the total number of iterations the loop executed, `t` must be greater than 0, `d1[start]` contains the final value of `s` for the last `start` value, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory int, `n` is an input integer, `lst` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `end` is `len(lst) - 1`, `s` is the accumulated sum based on the conditions inside the loop, `start` is equal to `end`, and `mini` is the minimum value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `abs(lst[start] - lst[start + 1])` if both conditions are met, otherwise it remains 11111111.

This output state describes the final values of the variables after the loop has completed all its iterations. The loop iteratively updates the value of `s` based on the minimum difference between adjacent elements in the list `lst`, and stores these values in `d1` for each `start` position. The loop continues until `start` equals `end`.
