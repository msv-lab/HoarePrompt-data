Postcondition: `i` is 4, `m` is greater than 4, `start` is 3, `s` is 0, `s1` is the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[3]` or `d2[end]` and `d2[3]`, and `s2` is the absolute difference between `d2[start]` and `d2[end]` or `d1[start]` and `d1[end]`, depending on whether `start < end` is true or false.
