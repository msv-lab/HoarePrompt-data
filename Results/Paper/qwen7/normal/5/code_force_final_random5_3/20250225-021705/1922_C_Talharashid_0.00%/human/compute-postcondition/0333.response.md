Output State: **`i` is 4, `t` is the same, `m` must be greater than 3, `end` is the length of `lst` - 1 and must be greater than 0, `s` is either 1 or the sum of `s` and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start + inc]`, `start` is 1, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where `d1[0]` is `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `inc` is 1, `mini` is 11111111.**

Explanation: The line `mini = 11111111` simply assigns the value `11111111` to the variable `mini`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
