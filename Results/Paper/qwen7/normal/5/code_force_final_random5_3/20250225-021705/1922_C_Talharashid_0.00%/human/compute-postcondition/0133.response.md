Output State: **`start` is an input integer, `end` is an input integer - 1, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum distance found during the entire loop execution, `s` is either `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])` or `abs(d2[end] - d1[start])`, `i` is 1, `m` is the input integer `m`, `s2` is either `abs(d2[start] - d2[end])` or `abs(d1[start] - d2[end])`**.

Explanation: The code `start, end = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and splits them by space, assigning the first integer to `start` and the second integer to `end`. The values of `inc`, `mini`, `s`, `i`, `m`, and `s2` remain unchanged from their initial state.
