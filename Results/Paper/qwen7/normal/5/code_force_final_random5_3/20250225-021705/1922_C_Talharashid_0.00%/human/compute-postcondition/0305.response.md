Output State: **`i` is 4, `t` is the same, `m` must be greater than 3, `end` is `end - 3`, `s` is 0, `start` is `start - 3`, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`.**

The code initializes `d2` as a defaultdict with `int` as the default factory. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state retains the values of `i`, `t`, `m`, `end`, `s`, `start`, and `d1` as they were in the initial state, while adding `d2` with its default factory set to `int`.
