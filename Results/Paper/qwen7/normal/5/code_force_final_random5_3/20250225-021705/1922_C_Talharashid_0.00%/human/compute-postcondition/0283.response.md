Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `end` is `end - 1`, `s` is 0, `start` is `start - 1`, `s1` is `abs(d1[end] - d1[start])`, `s2` is `abs(d1[start] - d1[end])` based on whether `start < end` is true or false.**

Explanation: The code updates `s1` to be the absolute difference between `d1[end]` and `d1[start]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The conditions and values of `m`, `end`, `start`, and the expressions for `s1` and `s2` are updated according to the provided initial state.
