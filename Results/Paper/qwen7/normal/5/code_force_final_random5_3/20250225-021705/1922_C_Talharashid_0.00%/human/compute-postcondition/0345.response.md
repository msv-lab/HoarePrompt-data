Output State: **`i` is 4, `t` is the same, `m` must be greater than 3, `end` is the length of `lst` - 1 and must be greater than 0, `s` is the sum of 1 and the absolute difference between `lst[start]` and `lst[start - 1]`, `start` is 3, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where `d1[0]` is `s + abs(lst[3] - lst[2])`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int`, `inc` is 1, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `11111111`, `d1[start]` is `s`**.

This means that the value of `d1[start]` (which is `d1[3]`) has been updated to `s`, which is the sum of 1 and the absolute difference between `lst[3]` and `lst[2]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
