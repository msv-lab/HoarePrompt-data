Output State: **`start` is `start` - 1, `end` is an input integer, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum distance found during the entire loop execution, `s` is the final accumulated value of `s` after all iterations, `i` is 0, `m` is the input integer `m`.**

The code `start -= 1` decrements the value of `start` by 1. The other variables (`end`, `inc`, `mini`, `s`, `i`, and `m`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
