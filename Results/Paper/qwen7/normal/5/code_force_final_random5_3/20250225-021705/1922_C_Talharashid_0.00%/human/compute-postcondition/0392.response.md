Output State: **`i` is 4, `t` is the same, `m` must be greater than 3, `end` is 0, `s` is either 1 or `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])`, `start` must be decremented further until it is not equal to 0, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where `d1[start]` is `s`, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory `int` where `d2[start]` is `s`, `inc` is -1, `mini` is the minimum of `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and `11111111` and `mini` is updated to be the minimum between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and the previous value of `mini`.**

This means that the variable `mini` has been updated to store the smaller value between `abs(lst[start] - lst[start - 1])` and its previous value (`11111111`). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
