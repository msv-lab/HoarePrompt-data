Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `end` is `end - 1`, `s` is 0, `s1` is `abs(d2[end] - d2[start])`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between `d2[end]` and `d2[start]` and assigns it to `s1`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was initially set to 0. The condition that `m` must be greater than 0 and `start` is greater than or equal to `end` still holds true. The value of `end` is updated to `end - 1`. The variable `s` remains unchanged as it was initially set to 0.
