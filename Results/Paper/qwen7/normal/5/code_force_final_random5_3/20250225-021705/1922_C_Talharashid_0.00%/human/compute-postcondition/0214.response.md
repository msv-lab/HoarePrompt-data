Output State: **`mini` holds the minimum distance found during the entire loop execution, `start` is now equal to `len(lst) - 1`, `end` is 0, `inc` remains unchanged from its initial value, `s` contains the sum of distances calculated during each iteration of the loop, `i` remains unchanged from its initial value, `m` remains unchanged from its initial value, `d1` is a dictionary where keys are indices from `start` to `end` and values are cumulative sums of distances up to those indices, `d2` remains unchanged from its initial state, `s2` remains unchanged from its initial state, `s1` remains unchanged from its initial state, `n` remains unchanged from its initial value, `lst` remains unchanged from its initial state.**

This output state reflects that the variable `end` has been explicitly set to 0, while `start` has been updated to `len(lst) - 1`. All other variables retain their initial states as described in the precondition.
