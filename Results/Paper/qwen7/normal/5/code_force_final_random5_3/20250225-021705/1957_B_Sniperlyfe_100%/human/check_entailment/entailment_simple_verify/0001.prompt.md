You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
    nums[0] += k
    return nums



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and k are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to `n`, `k` will be less than or equal to 0, and every element from `nums[1]` to `nums[n-1]` will be set to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` as long as `k` was greater than 0 during the iterations.
    nums[0] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list `nums` where `nums[0]` is equal to its original value plus `k`, and every element from `nums[1]` to `nums[n-1]` is set to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` if `k` was greater than 0 during the iterations. Additionally, `i` is equal to `n` and `k` is less than or equal to 0.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function constructs an array `nums` of length `n` initialized to zeros.
   - It sets `nums[0]` to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. This value is the largest number with `k.bit_length()` bits set to 1. For example, if `k = 5`, `k.bit_length()` is 3, and `(1 << 2) - 1` is 3 (binary `11`).
   - It then adjusts `k` by subtracting this value from `k`.
   - It iterates through the rest of the array (`i` from 1 to `n-1`):
     - If `k` is greater than 0, it sets `nums[i]` to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and `k`.
     - It decreases `k` by the value assigned to `nums[i]`.
   - Finally, it adjusts `nums[0]` by adding the remaining value of `k`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program collects the results of `func_1` for each test case and prints them out.

### Verification of Correctness:

1. **Sum Condition**:
   - The sum of the numbers should be `k`. The code ensures that the sum is correct because `nums[0]` is adjusted at the end to make sure the total sum is `k`.

2. **Bitwise OR Condition**:
   - The goal is to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of all elements.
   - The initial value of `nums[0]` is chosen to be the largest possible number with `k.bit_length()` bits set to 1. This ensures that the first element contributes significantly to the OR result.
   - Subsequent elements are set to `nums[0] + 1` when possible, which further increases the number of 1s in the OR result.
   - The adjustments ensure that the sum condition is met while maximizing the number of 1s in the OR result.

### Example Walkthrough:

- **Test Case 1**: `n = 1`, `k = 5`
  - `nums[0] = 5` (since `5` is the largest number with 3 bits set to 1).
  - Output: `5`

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 2`, `k = 3`
  - `nums[0] = 3` (since `3` is the largest number with 2 bits set to 1).
  - `nums[1] = 0` (since `k` is already 0 after setting `nums[0]`).
  - Output: `3 0`

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 2`, `k = 5`
  - `nums[0] = 3` (since `3` is the largest number with 2 bits set to 1).
  - `nums[1] = 2` (since `k = 2` after setting `nums[0]`).
  - Output: `3 2`

- **Test Case 4**: `n = 6`, `k = 51`
  - `nums[0] = 31` (since `31` is the largest number with 5 bits set to 1).
  - `nums[1] = 1` (since `k = 20` after setting `nums[0]`).
  - `nums[2] = 1` (since `k = 18` after setting `nums[1]`).
  - `nums[3] = 32` (since `k = 6` after setting `nums[1]` and `nums[2]`).
  - `nums[4] = 2` (since `k = 4` after setting `nums[3]`).
  - `nums[5] = 12` (since `k = 0` after setting `nums[4]`).
  - Output: `31 1 1 32 2 12`

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence while ensuring the sum condition is met. Therefore, the program is correct.
