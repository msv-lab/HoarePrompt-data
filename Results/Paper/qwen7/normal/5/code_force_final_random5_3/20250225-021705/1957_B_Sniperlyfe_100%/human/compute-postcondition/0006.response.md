Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `nums[i]` is equal to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `nums[i]` to be the minimum between `nums[0] + 1` and `k`. Since `i` is 1, `nums[i]` becomes `nums[1]`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
