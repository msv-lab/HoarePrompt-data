Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is 2
- `k` is decreased by `nums[1]`
- `nums[1]` is equal to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`
- If `k` is greater than 0, then `nums[2]` is also equal to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` and `k` is further decreased by `nums[1]`

### Loop Head:
```
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 each iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be 3.

2. **Variable `k`:**
   - `k` is decreased by `nums[1]` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - We need to check if `k` is still greater than 0 to determine if the loop continues.
   - If `k` is greater than 0, `nums[2]` is set to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` and `k` is further decreased by `nums[1]`.

### Adjusting States:
- `i` will be incremented to 3.
- We need to check the value of `k` to determine if the loop continues.
- If `k` is greater than 0, `nums[2]` will be set to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` and `k` will be further decreased by `nums[1]`.

### Conclusion:
- If `k` is greater than 0, the loop will continue.
- If `k` is not greater than 0, the loop will terminate.

### Final State:
- `i` will be 3.
- `k` will either remain as it is (if it was not greater than 0) or be updated based on the conditions mentioned.

Given the conditions, let's assume `k` is still greater than 0 for the next iteration (since the problem does not specify otherwise).

State: **`i` is 3, `k` is decreased by `nums[1]`, and `nums[2]` is equal to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` and `k` is further decreased by `nums[1]` if `k` is greater than 0.**

However, since we don't know the exact value of `k` after the previous iteration, we can represent it as:

State: **`i` is 3, `k` is decreased by `nums[1]`, and `nums[2]` is equal to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` if `k` is greater than 0.**

Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 3, `k` is decreased by `nums[1]`, and `nums[2]` is equal to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` if `k` is greater than 0.**
