Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and First Element Assignment**: The program correctly initializes a list `nums` of size `n` with all elements set to 0. It then assigns the first element `nums[0]` to a specific value based on `k` using `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. This value is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.

2. **Adjusting Remaining Value of `k`**: After setting `nums[0]`, the program correctly reduces `k` by this value. This ensures that the sum of the elements in `nums` will eventually match `k`.

3. **Filling the Rest of the List**: The program iterates through the rest of the list from index 1 to `n-1`. For each element, it sets the value to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and the remaining value of `k`. This step ensures that the bitwise OR of all elements in `nums` is maximized while maintaining the sum constraint.

4. **Final Adjustment**: After filling the list, the program adjusts `nums[0]` by adding any remaining value of `k`. This ensures that the sum of all elements in `nums` equals `k`.

5. **Output Format**: The program formats the output as required, joining the elements of `nums` with spaces and printing each test case's result on a new line.

Given the execution summary and the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to satisfy the conditions specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
