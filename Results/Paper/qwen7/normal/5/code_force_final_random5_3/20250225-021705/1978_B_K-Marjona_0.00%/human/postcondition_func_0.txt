The function processes a specified number of test cases, where each test case consists of three positive integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \). For each test case, it calculates and prints one of two possible outputs based on the values of \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \). If \( b \leq a \), it prints \( a \times n \). Otherwise, it calculates and prints a specific formula involving \( b \), \( k \) (the minimum of \( n \) and \( b - a \)), and \( a \). After processing all test cases, the function ends with all input variables reset for each test case.
