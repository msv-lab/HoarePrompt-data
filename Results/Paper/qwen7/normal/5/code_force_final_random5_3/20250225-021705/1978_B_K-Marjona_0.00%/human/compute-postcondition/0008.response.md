Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases.
   - `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers split from the input.
   - `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.
   - `b` is greater than `a`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:
   - We need to determine the value of `k` first, which is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.
   - Let's denote `k = min(n, b - a)`.
   - Now, let's analyze the expression inside the `print` function:
     - `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2`: This part calculates the average of `b` and `b - k + 1`.
     - Multiplying this result by `k` gives us the first term of the expression.
     - `(n - k) * a`: This part multiplies the difference between `n` and `k` by `a`.
     - Adding these two results together gives the final output.

4. **Final Expression**:
   - The expression simplifies to: \(\text{average} \times k + (n - k) \times a\), where the average is \(\frac{b + (b - k + 1)}{2}\).

Given the above analysis, the final output of the print statement is:

Output: **(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a (where k = min(n, b - a))**
