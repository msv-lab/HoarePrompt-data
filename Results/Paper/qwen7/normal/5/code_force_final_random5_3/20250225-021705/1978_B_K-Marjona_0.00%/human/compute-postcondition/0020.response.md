Output: **a * n (where a is the input integer, and n is the input integer)**

Explanation:
- `t` is a positive integer representing the number of remaining test cases minus 1. This variable is not used in the print statement and does not affect the output.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`, but this variable is also not used in the print statement.

The print statement `print(a * n)` simply multiplies the input integer `a` by the input integer `n` and prints the result. Therefore, the output is `a * n`.
