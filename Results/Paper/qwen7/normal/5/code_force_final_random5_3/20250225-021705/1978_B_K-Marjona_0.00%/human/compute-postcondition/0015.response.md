Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer representing the number of remaining test cases.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is an input integer.
   - `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.

2. **Expression to Evaluate:**
   ```python
   (b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Evaluation:**
   - First, determine the value of `k`:
     \[
     k = \min(n, b - a)
     \]
   - Next, evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:
     \[
     b + (b - k + 1) = 2b - k + 1
     \]
   - Divide the result by 2:
     \[
     \frac{2b - k + 1}{2}
     \]
   - Multiply this result by `k`:
     \[
     \left(\frac{2b - k + 1}{2}\right) * k
     \]
   - Add the result of `(n - k) * a` to the previous result:
     \[
     \left(\frac{2b - k + 1}{2}\right) * k + (n - k) * a
     \]

4. **Final Expression Simplified:**
   - The expression simplifies to:
     \[
     \left(\frac{2b - k + 1}{2}\right) * k + (n - k) * a
     \]

Given the above steps, the final expression will be evaluated with the values of `b`, `k`, and `n` as defined. Since `a` and `b` are input integers and `k` is determined from `n` and `b - a`, the expression will produce a specific numerical value based on these inputs.

Output: **(b + (b - k + 1) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a) (where b, n, a, and k are defined as per the initial state)**
