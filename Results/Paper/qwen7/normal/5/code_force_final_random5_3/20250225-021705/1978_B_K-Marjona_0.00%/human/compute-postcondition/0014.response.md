Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer representing the number of remaining test cases.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(a * n)
```

Here, the value of `a * n` will be printed. Since `a` and `n` are explicitly defined as input integers, their values will be used directly in the calculation.

Output: **a * n**
