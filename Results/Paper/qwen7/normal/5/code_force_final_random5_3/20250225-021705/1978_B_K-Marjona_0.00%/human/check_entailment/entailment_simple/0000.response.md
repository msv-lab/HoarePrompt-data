Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. It calculates `k` as the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. This is correct because `k` should be the smallest value between the number of buns and the difference between the modified price and the usual price.
4. If `b <= a`, it prints `a * n`, which means all buns are sold at the usual price. This is correct because the modified price would not increase the profit in this case.
5. Otherwise, it calculates the profit using the formula `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a`. This formula correctly calculates the sum of an arithmetic series for the first `k` buns and adds the profit from the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price `a`.

Given the logic and the calculations in the program match the problem statement and the examples provided, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
