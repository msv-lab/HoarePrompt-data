Let's break down the expression step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables:**
   - `t`: A positive integer representing the number of remaining test cases minus 1.
   - `n`: An input integer.
   - `a`: An input integer.
   - `b`: An input integer.
   - `k`: The minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.

2. **Expression Breakdown:**
   - `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k`: This part calculates the sum of an arithmetic series with the first term `b - k + 1`, the last term `b`, and the number of terms `k`.
   - `(n - k) * a`: This part multiplies the difference between `n` and `k` by `a`.

3. **Simplifying the Expression:**
   - The first part of the expression simplifies to the sum of the arithmetic series:
     \[
     \text{Sum} = \frac{k}{2} \times ((b - k + 1) + b) = \frac{k}{2} \times (2b - k + 1)
     \]
   - So, the full expression becomes:
     \[
     \frac{k}{2} \times (2b - k + 1) + (n - k) \times a
     \]

4. **Substitute the Values:**
   - Since `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`, let's denote it as `k = min(n, b - a)`.
   - The expression now becomes:
     \[
     \frac{\min(n, b - a)}{2} \times (2b - \min(n, b - a) + 1) + (n - \min(n, b - a)) \times a
     \]

5. **Final Output Description:**
   - The expression will evaluate to a specific numerical value based on the inputs `n`, `a`, `b`, and `k`.
   - Since the exact values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `t` are not provided, we can only describe the expression in terms of these variables.

Output: **(k / 2) * (2b - k + 1) + (n - k) * a where k = min(n, b - a)**
