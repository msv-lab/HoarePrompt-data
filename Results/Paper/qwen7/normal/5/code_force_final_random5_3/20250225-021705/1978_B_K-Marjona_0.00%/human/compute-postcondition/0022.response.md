Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of remaining test cases minus 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`. The value of `k` remains unchanged regardless of the condition in the if statement.**
