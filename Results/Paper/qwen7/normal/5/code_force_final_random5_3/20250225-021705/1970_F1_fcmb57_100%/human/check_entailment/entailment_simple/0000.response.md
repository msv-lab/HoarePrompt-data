Reasoning:
1. The program correctly parses the input and initializes the field, players, and goals.
2. The `func_1` function correctly updates the position of a player based on the direction specified.
3. The program processes each action in the sequence and updates the score accordingly when a player scores in the opponent's goal.
4. The final score is printed after processing all actions.

However, there are a few issues with the implementation:
- The `func_1` function should modify the dictionary entry for the player's position rather than returning a new tuple.
- The program does not handle the case where a player catches the Quaffle or throws it properly.
- The program does not account for the initial position of the Quaffle and how it moves when a player throws it.

Given these points, let's correct the implementation:

```python
(n, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
players = {}
goals = {'B': [], 'R': []}
mouvements = {'L': (-1, 0), 'R': (1, 0), 'U': (0, -1), 'D': (0, 1)}
(pointsb, pointsr) = (0, 0)
field = []

# Initialize the field
for y in range(n):
    s = input().split()
    row = []
    for x in range(m):
        if s[x] == '..' or s[x] == '.Q':
            row.append('.')
        elif s[x] == 'RG':
            goals['R'].append((x, y))
        elif s[x] == 'BG':
            goals['B'].append((x, y))
        else:
            players[s[x]] = (x, y)
            row.append(s[x][0])  # Store the team identifier
    field.append(row)

moves = int(input())
for i in range(moves):
    mo = input().split()
    entity, action = mo[0], mo[1]
    if entity in players:
        x, y = players[entity]
        if action in 'ULDR':
            dx, dy = mouvements[action]
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < m and 0 <= ny < n and field[ny][nx] != '.':
                players[entity] = (nx, ny)
        elif action == 'C':
            ball = mo[2]
            if ball == '.Q':
                for p in players:
                    if players[p] == (x, y):
                        del players[p]
                        players[entity] = (x, y)
                        break
        elif action == 'T':
            for p in players:
                if players[p] == (x, y):
                    del players[p]
                    field[y][x] = '.'
                    field[(n-1)//2][(m-1)//2] = '.Q'
                    break
            if (x, y) in goals['R']:
                pointsb += 1
                print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
            elif (x, y) in goals['B']:
                pointsr += 1
                print(i, 'RED GOAL')

print('FINAL SCORE:', pointsr, pointsb)
```

With these corrections, the program should work as intended.

Correctness: **False**
