Reasoning:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the dimensions \(n\) and \(m\) of the field, and the initial state of the field including players, goals, and the Quaffle. It also correctly identifies the positions of players and goals.

2. **Movement Logic**: The movement logic is implemented using a dictionary `mouvements` that maps directions to their corresponding changes in coordinates. The function `func_1` correctly updates the position of a player based on the direction specified.

3. **Action Handling**: The program correctly handles different actions:
   - **Movement (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`)**: Players move to the specified direction, updating their position correctly.
   - **Catching the Quaffle (`C`)**: When a player catches the Quaffle, the program updates the player's position and the Quaffle's position to the current player's position.
   - **Throwing the Quaffle (`T`)**: When a player throws the Quaffle, the Quaffle is placed at the player's current position, and the player stops carrying the Quaffle.

4. **Scoring Logic**: The program correctly checks if a player has scored by placing the Quaffle in the opponent's goal. If a player scores, the appropriate message is printed with the current time (action index).

5. **Final Score Calculation**: After processing all actions, the program correctly prints the final score.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to handle all aspects of the problem as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
