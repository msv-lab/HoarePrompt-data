Output State: **a is x, b is assigned to dx, y is assigned to dy**

Explanation: The code `dx, dy = b` unpacks the tuple `b` into the variables `dx` and `dy`. Since `b` is a tuple containing two elements (as implied by the unpacking), `dx` will be assigned the first element of `b`, and `dy` will be assigned the second element of `b`. The variables `a` and `y` remain unchanged from their initial states.
