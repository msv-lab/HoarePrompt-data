Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it checks if a given string `c` can be formed by characters that do not simultaneously appear in both strings `a` and `b`. If for every character in `c`, there is at least one position in either `a` or `b` where the character does not appear, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.**
