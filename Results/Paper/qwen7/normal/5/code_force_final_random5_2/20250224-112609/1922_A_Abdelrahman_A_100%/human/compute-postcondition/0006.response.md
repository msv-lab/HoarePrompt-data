Output State: **`no` is True, `i` is 0, `slength` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string, `c` is the input string from the user.**

The code simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `no`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `slength`, `a`, `b`, and `c`) remain unchanged.
