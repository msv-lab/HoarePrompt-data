Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to `n`. The values of `i`, `t`, `s`, and `results` remain unchanged from their initial states.
