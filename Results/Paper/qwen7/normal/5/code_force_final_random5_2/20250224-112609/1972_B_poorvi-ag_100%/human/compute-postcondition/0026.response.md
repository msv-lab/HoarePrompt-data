Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The only object in the loop head is `i`, which is iterating over the `results` list.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop will start with `i` being the first element of the `results` list.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements left in the `results` list. Once `i` has iterated through all elements in the `results` list, the loop will terminate.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Since the loop is iterating over the `results` list, the initial state of `i` should be set to the first element of the `results` list. Additionally, the `results` list must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

Given the postconditions provided:
- `i` is 99 (this is the value of `i` at the last iteration, but not relevant for the initial state)
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) (not relevant for the initial state of the loop)
- `n` is an input integer (not relevant for the initial state of the loop)
- `arr` is the string input from the user for the last iteration (not relevant for the initial state of the loop)
- `results` is a list containing 100 elements, each being either 'yes' or 'no' based on whether the count of 'U' in `arr` is odd or even, respectively

The only relevant information for the initial state of the loop is that `results` must have at least one element for the loop to execute, and `i` should be set to the first element of the `results` list.

Therefore, the adjusted state before the loop starts is:

**State: **`results` is a list containing 100 elements, each being either 'yes' or 'no', and the first element of `results` is assigned to `i`**.
