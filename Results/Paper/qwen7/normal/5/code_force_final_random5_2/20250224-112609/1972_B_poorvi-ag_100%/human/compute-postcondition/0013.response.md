Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' based on whether the count of 'U' in `arr` is odd or even, respectively, and `arr` is a new string input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `arr = input()` takes a new string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `arr`. The values of `i`, `t`, `s`, and `results` remain unchanged from their initial states.
