Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `results` is a list containing 99 elements, each being either 'yes' or 'no'.
   - The second element of `results` is the third element from the original list.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(i)
   ```

From the initial state, we know that the second element of `results` is the same as the third element of `results`. Let's denote this common value as `third_element`.

Since the code snippet simply prints `i`, and there is no explicit assignment or initialization of `i` in the given snippet, we need to infer the value of `i` from the context. Typically, in such snippets without further context, `i` might be expected to be an index or a variable used in a loop or similar context. However, since no such context is provided, and the code only prints `i` without assigning it a specific value, we must assume that `i` is being referenced in a way that would make sense in the context of the list `results`.

Given the nature of the problem, if `i` is intended to reference the index of the second element in the list `results`, then `i` would be 1 (since list indices start at 0).

Therefore, the output will be the value of `i`, which is 1.

Output: **1**
