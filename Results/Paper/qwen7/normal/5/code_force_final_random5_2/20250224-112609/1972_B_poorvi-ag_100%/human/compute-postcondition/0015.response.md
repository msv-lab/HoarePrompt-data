Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `results` is a list containing 'no', `arr` is a new string input by the user.**

The code appends the string `'no'` to the list `results`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
