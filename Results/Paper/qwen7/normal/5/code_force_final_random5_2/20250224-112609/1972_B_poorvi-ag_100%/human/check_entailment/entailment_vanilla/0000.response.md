### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves a game where players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins. The goal is to determine the winner based on the initial configuration of the coins.

2. **Key Insight**: The key insight here is that the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of facing-up coins determines the outcome. If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can force a win by playing optimally. If it's even, Bob can force a win by playing optimally.

3. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `arr` representing the initial state of the coins.
   - It counts the number of 'U' (facing-up) coins using `arr.count('U')`.
   - If the count of 'U' is odd, it appends 'yes' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'no'.
   - Finally, it prints the results.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic correctly identifies whether the number of facing-up coins is odd or even.
   - Based on this, it decides the winner correctly ('yes' for odd, 'no' for even).
   - The output format matches the required format.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution based on the problem statement and the provided examples.

### Correctness:
**True**
