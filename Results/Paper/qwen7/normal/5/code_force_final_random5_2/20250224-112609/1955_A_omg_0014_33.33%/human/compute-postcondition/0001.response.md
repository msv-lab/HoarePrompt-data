State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` must be 0, `n` must be greater than 0** 

Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
- For the loop to execute, the variable `n` must be greater than 0 because the `range(n)` function generates numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
- The initial value of `i` is 0, as the loop starts with `i` set to 0.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. The value of `t` (which is between 1 and \(10^4\)) does not affect the loop's execution and can remain unchanged.
