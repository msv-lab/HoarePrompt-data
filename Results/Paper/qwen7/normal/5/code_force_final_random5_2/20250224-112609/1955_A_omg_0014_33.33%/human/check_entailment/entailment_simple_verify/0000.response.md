### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step using the provided annotations and the original assessment.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))
```

#### Annotations:
- Before the function call, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- Inside the function, `n` is the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(1 \leq a, b \leq 30\).
- `d` is calculated as `c / 2`.
- The program checks if buying one yogurt at the regular price (`a * b`) is cheaper than buying one yogurt at the promotion price (`a * d`). If it is, it prints `a * b`; otherwise, it prints `round(a * d)`.

#### Original Assessment:
- The assessment states that the program is incorrect because it incorrectly calculates the average cost per yogurt for the promotion (`d = c / 2`) and does not account for the optimal way to group the yogurts to minimize the total cost.
- The assessment provides an example to demonstrate the error: for the input `3 5 11`, the program outputs `15` instead of the correct `16`.

#### Analysis:
1. **Promotion Calculation**: The calculation `d = c / 2` is intended to represent the cost of one yogurt when bought as part of a pair under the promotion. However, this is not the correct way to determine the cost of a single yogurt in a pair.
2. **Comparison Logic**: The logic `if a * b < a * d` is flawed because it does not correctly compare the cost of buying individual yogurts versus pairs of yogurts. Instead, it compares the cost of one yogurt at the regular price with half the cost of a pair.
3. **Correct Approach**: To find the minimum cost, we should:
   - Calculate how many pairs of yogurts can be bought at the promotion price.
   - Calculate the remaining single yogurts needed after buying as many pairs as possible.
   - Compute the total cost by summing the cost of these pairs and the remaining single yogurts.

#### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        pairs = c // 2
        remaining = c % 2
        total_cost = (pairs // 2) * (2 * b) + (pairs % 2) * b + remaining * b
        print(total_cost)
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was accurate. The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for buying \( n \) yogurts under the promotion. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

**Final: False**
