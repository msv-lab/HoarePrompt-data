Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs t, n, a, and b where t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers between 1 and 100 and 1 and 30 respectively. The function returns different outputs based on the values of n, a, and b.**

This means the function indirectly accepts multiple sets of parameters through variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`, and processes them according to their ranges, returning appropriate results for each test case.
