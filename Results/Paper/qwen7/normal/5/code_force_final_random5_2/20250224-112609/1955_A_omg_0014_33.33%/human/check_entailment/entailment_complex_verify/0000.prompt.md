You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        d = c / 2
        
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` equals `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variable `n` is the number of times the loop executed, which means `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`. For each iteration, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split, and `d` is calculated as `c / 2`. After executing the if-else block, the output is either `a * b` if it is less than `a * d`, or `round(a * d)` otherwise. The final state does not depend on the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `c` for each iteration but rather on the completion of the loop with `i` equal to `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers n, a, and b. It calculates either a * b or round(a * c/2) based on the comparison between a * b and a * c/2, where c is another integer input. After processing all test cases, it outputs the results for each case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for buying \( n \) yogurts under the given promotion. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the average cost per yogurt for the promotion (`d = c / 2`) and does not account for the optimal way to group the yogurts to minimize the total cost.

For example, consider the input:
```
3 5 11
```
- The program calculates `d = 11 / 2 = 5.5`.
- It then compares `a * b` (which is `5 * 3 = 15`) with `a * d` (which is `5 * 5.5 = 27.5`), and prints `15`.

However, the correct approach would be to buy one yogurt at the regular price and the second yogurt at the promotion price, which would cost `5 + 11 = 16`. This is less than `15`, so the program is incorrect for this case.

To fix this, the program should calculate the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and then handle the remaining yogurts at the regular price.
