Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split, `d` is equal to `c / 2`, and after the execution of the if-else block, `a * b` is either less than `a * d` or greater than or equal to `a * d`.
