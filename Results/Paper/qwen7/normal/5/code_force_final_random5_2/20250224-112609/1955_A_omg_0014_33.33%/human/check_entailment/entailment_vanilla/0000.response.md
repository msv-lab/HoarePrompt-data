Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then enters a loop that iterates `n` times, reading three integers `(a, b, c)` for each test case.
   - Here, `a` is the price of one yogurt, `b` is the price for two yogurts, and `c` is used incorrectly (it should be `b`).

2. **Calculation:**
   - The variable `d` is assigned the value of `c / 2`, which should actually be `b / 2` since `b` is the price for two yogurts.
   - The condition `if a * b < a * d:` checks if buying one yogurt at the regular price is cheaper than buying one yogurt at half the price of two yogurts. This logic is incorrect because `d` should represent the price per yogurt when bought in pairs, not half the price of two yogurts.
   - If the condition is true, it prints `a * b`, which is the total cost if buying all yogurts at the regular price.
   - Otherwise, it prints `round(a * d)`, which is the total cost if buying all yogurts at the promotion price.

3. **Promotion Logic:**
   - The promotion logic should be based on the optimal way to use the promotion to minimize cost.
   - Buying in pairs can be more cost-effective, so we need to calculate the cost considering both the regular price and the promotion price.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly implement the solution, we need to:
- Calculate the cost if all yogurts are bought individually.
- Calculate the cost if we maximize the use of the promotion (buying as many pairs as possible).
- Compare these two costs and choose the minimum.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        # Cost if all yogurts are bought individually
        cost_individual = a * n
        # Number of pairs we can buy
        num_pairs = n // 2
        # Remaining yogurts after buying pairs
        remaining_yogurts = n % 2
        # Cost if we use the promotion for as many pairs as possible
        cost_promotion = num_pairs * c + remaining_yogurts * a
        # Print the minimum cost
        print(min(cost_individual, cost_promotion))
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has logical errors in its calculation and does not correctly implement the promotion logic. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
