Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 0.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split.
- `d` is equal to `c / 2`.
- The current value of `a * b` is less than the current value of `a * d`.

We need to determine what will be printed when the statement `print(a * b)` is executed.

From the conditions given:
- `d = c / 2`, so `a * d = a * (c / 2)`.
- We know that `a * b < a * d`, which implies `a * b < a * (c / 2)`. Since `a` is a non-zero integer (otherwise the inequality would not make sense), we can divide both sides by `a` to get `b < c / 2`.

However, the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not explicitly given, but we know they come from an input split. The only thing we can definitively say is that `a * b` is being printed, and it is less than `a * (c / 2)`.

Therefore, the output will be the product of `a` and `b`, where `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input.

Output: **a * b (where a and b are integers obtained from the input and a * b < a * (c / 2))**
