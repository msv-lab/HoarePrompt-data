Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split.
- `d` is equal to `c / 2`.
- `a * b` is either less than `a * (c / 2)` or greater than or equal to `a * (c / 2)`.
- `d` is now set to `c / 2`.

The `print(a * b)` statement will print the product of `a` and `b`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `a * b`. However, we know it is either less than `a * (c / 2)` or greater than or equal to `a * (c / 2)`.

Output: **a * b (where a and b are integers obtained from the input split)**
