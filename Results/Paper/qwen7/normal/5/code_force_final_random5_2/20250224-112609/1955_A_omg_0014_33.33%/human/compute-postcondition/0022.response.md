Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split.
   - `d` is equal to `c / 2`.
   - `a * b` is either less than `a * (c / 2)` or greater than or equal to `a * (c / 2)`.
   - `d` is recalculated as `c / 2`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(round(a * d))
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `d` is initially set to `c / 2`.
- `d` is then recalculated as `c / 2` again, so it remains `c / 2`.

Given this, the expression `a * d` simplifies to `a * (c / 2)`.

Since `a * b` is either less than `a * (c / 2)` or greater than or equal to `a * (c / 2)`, but the exact value of `b` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `a * (c / 2)`. However, we know that `d` is `c / 2`, and the expression `a * d` will be rounded to the nearest integer.

Therefore, the output will be the rounded value of `a * (c / 2)`.

Output: **round(a * (c / 2))**
