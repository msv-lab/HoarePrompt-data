Output State: **`list1` is not empty, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `num` is 0, `s` is 0, `list2` is now containing one element which is the integer representation of `a`, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string**.

Explanation: The code `list2.append(int(a))` appends the integer representation of the input string `a` to the list `list2`. Since `a` is an input string, its integer representation is added to `list2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
