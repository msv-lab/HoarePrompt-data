Output State: **`b` is a non-empty string, list1 is a list of strings obtained by splitting `b`, `list2` is a list with one element which is the integer representation of the first string in `list1`.**

Explanation: The code appends the integer representation of the first string in `list1` to `list2`. Since `list1` is obtained by splitting `b`, `list2` will contain one element, which is the integer representation of the first string in `list1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
