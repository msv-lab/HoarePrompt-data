Output State: **`b` is a non-empty string, `list2` is a sorted list, `s` is 0, `final` is a list containing one element which is `s`, `num` is incremented by 1, `int(n)` remains the same**

Explanation: The code `s = 0` initializes `s` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `b` remains a non-empty string, `list2` remains a sorted list, `final` is still a list containing the original value of `s` (which is now 0), `num` is incremented by 1, and `int(n)` remains the same.
