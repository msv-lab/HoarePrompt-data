Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads `n` as a string and then tries to use it as an integer in the loop, which will cause a TypeError. It should directly use `int(n)` without reassigning it to `n`.

2. **Score Calculation**: The score calculation logic is flawed. The variable `s` is reset to 0 at the beginning of each test case, but this is unnecessary since we are calculating scores for different test cases. Also, the logic for summing up the minimum values every two elements in the sorted list is correct, but the way it's implemented might lead to confusion.

3. **Test Case Loop**: The program reads `n` and processes multiple test cases within the same loop, which is incorrect. Each test case should be processed separately.

4. **Reading Input**: The program reads `a` and `b` as strings and then splits `b` into a list of integers. This is unnecessary because `a` is not used and `b` should be read once per test case.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        nums = list(map(int, data[index:index + 2 * n]))
        index += 2 * n
        
        nums.sort()
        score = sum(nums[i] for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2))
        results.append(score)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

func()
```

This corrected version properly handles multiple test cases and calculates the maximum score correctly.
