### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the problem and the provided code to understand why the assessment is correct.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to find the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. A cyclic shift involves moving the last character of a chosen substring to the beginning of that substring.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
- **Function `func_1`:**
  - The function reads a binary string `s` and initializes `n` to count the number of '1's and `ans` to accumulate the cost.
  - It iterates through the string and increments `n` whenever it encounters a '1'.
  - When it encounters a '0' and `n` is non-zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
  - Finally, it prints `ans`.

- **Function `func_2`:**
  - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling `func_1`.

#### Key Issues with the Provided Code:
1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the cost based on the number of '0's between '1's plus one. This is not the correct way to determine the minimum cost for sorting the string using cyclic shifts.
   - For example, consider the string `101011`. The correct minimum cost is 9, as shown in the example output. However, the function `func_1` would incorrectly calculate the cost as 4.

2. **Lack of Correct Strategy:**
   - The function does not account for the need to perform multiple cyclic shifts to achieve the sorted order. It only considers the positions of '1's and '0's without considering the optimal sequence of shifts.

3. **Example Explanation:**
   - For the string `101011`, the correct strategy would involve multiple cyclic shifts:
     1. Choose the substring `[1, 3]` (101011 -> 010111): Cost = 3
     2. Choose the substring `[2, 4]` (010111 -> 001111): Cost = 3
     3. Choose the substring `[3, 5]` (001111 -> 000111): Cost = 3
   - The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9, which is the correct minimum cost.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem and hence the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
