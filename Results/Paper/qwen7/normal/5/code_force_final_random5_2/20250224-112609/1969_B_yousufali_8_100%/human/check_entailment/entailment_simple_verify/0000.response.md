### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why the provided program does not correctly solve the problem.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to find the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. A cyclic shift involves moving the last character of a chosen substring to the front of that substring.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The program iterates through the string `s` and counts the number of '1's (`n`) until it encounters a '0'.
   - When a '0' is encountered, it adds `n + 1` to the total cost (`ans`).
   - This logic is flawed because it only considers the cost of shifting a single block of '0's, without considering the need for multiple shifts to properly sort the string.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The logic in `func_2` is correct in terms of handling multiple test cases, but it relies on the incorrect logic in `func_1`.

#### Example Analysis:
Consider the input string `101011`:
- The provided program would count the number of '1's before the first '0', which is 1, and add 1 + 1 = 2 to the total cost.
- However, the correct minimum cost is 9, as explained in the problem note.

The program fails to handle the string as a sequence of segments of '1's and '0's and calculate the cost based on the positions of these segments. It only considers the cost of shifting a single block of '0's, which is insufficient for solving the problem correctly.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.

**Final: False**
