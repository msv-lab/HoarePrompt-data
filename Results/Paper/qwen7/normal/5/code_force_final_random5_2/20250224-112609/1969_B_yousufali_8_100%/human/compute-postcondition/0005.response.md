Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `t` which is used in the `range(t)` function.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**: The state given is that `t` must be greater than 0.

4. **Adjusting the State for Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0. Since no other variables are mentioned in the loop head, we only need to ensure that `t` remains greater than 0.

5. **Formulate the New State**: The new state should reflect that `t` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue executing.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
