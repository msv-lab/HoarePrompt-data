Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function processes a binary string `s` and calculates the minimum cost to sort it using cyclic shifts.
   - It correctly counts the number of '1's in the string (`n`).
   - For each '0' encountered, it adds the count of '1's seen so far plus one to `ans`. This is because each block of '0's can be moved to the front by performing cyclic shifts, and the cost is the length of the block plus one (to account for the shift operation).

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.
   - The logic ensures that for each test case, the binary string `s` is processed correctly by `func_1`.

3. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The program structure is correct and follows the problem statement.
   - It handles multiple test cases efficiently by using a loop.
   - Each test case is processed independently by `func_1`, which correctly computes the required cost.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
