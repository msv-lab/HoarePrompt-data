### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to sort a binary string in non-descending order with the minimum total cost. A cyclic shift operation on a substring of length `r-l+1` has a cost of `r-l+1`.

2. **Analyzing `func_1()`**:
   - The function `func_1()` takes a binary string `s` as input.
   - It iterates through the string and counts the number of consecutive '1's (`n`).
   - When it encounters a '0' after at least one '1' has been encountered (`n != 0`), it adds `n + 1` to the answer (`ans`). This suggests that it is counting the cost of shifting all '1's to the end of the string.
   - Finally, it prints the accumulated cost.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1()` is indeed flawed. It attempts to move all '1's to the end of the string, which is not always the optimal strategy. For example, consider the string "101011". The correct solution involves multiple shifts, but the current logic would incorrectly calculate the cost as 5 instead of 9.
   - The function does not consider the optimal way to perform cyclic shifts to minimize the total cost. Instead, it assumes that moving all '1's to the end is the best strategy, which is not true in many cases.

4. **Analyzing `func_2()`**:
   - The function `func_2()` reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1()` for each test case.
   - This part of the code is correct and handles multiple test cases as required.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The logic in `func_1()` is fundamentally flawed because it does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for sorting the string using cyclic shifts. The approach of moving all '1's to the end is not always optimal.
   - Therefore, the overall program will produce incorrect results for most test cases.

6. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The provided function summary for `func_2()` states that it processes a number of test cases and checks if a given binary string can be sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. However, this summary is misleading because the function does not actually check if the string can be sorted; it just prints the calculated cost, which is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts. The logic in `func_1()` is flawed and does not account for the optimal way to perform cyclic shifts.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
