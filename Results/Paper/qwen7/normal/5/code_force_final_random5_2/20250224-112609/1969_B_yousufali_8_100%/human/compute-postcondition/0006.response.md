Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The code `func_1()` is called, but since no changes to variables are made within this function call (no specific details about `func_1` are provided), the only precondition that remains valid is that `t` must be greater than 0. All other variables remain unaffected and retain their unspecified initial states.
