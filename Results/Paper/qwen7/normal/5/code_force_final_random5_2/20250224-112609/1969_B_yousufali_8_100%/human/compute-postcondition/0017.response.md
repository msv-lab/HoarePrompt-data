Output State: **`s` is an input binary string, `n` is 2, `ans` is 4, `i` is 3**.

Explanation: The code `ans += n + 1` increments the value of `ans` by the sum of `n` (which is 2) and 1. Therefore, `ans` changes from its initial value of 2 to 4. The other variables (`s`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
