Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is a positive integer.
   - `n` is the first integer entered by the user.
   - `a` is the second integer entered by the user.
   - `b` is the third integer entered by the user.
   - `k` is the minimum value between the new `n` and `b - a`.

2. **Expression to Evaluate**:
   ```python
   print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)
   ```

3. **Determine the Value of `k`**:
   - `k` is defined as the minimum value between the new `n` and `b - a`.
   - Since `n` is the first integer entered by the user, and `b` and `a` are the second and third integers entered by the user respectively, `k` will be `min(n, b - a)`.

4. **Substitute `k` into the Expression**:
   - Let's denote `k = min(n, b - a)`.
   - The expression becomes:
     \[
     (b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a
     \]
   - Simplify inside the parentheses:
     \[
     (b + b - k + 1) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a = (2b - k + 1) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a
     \]

5. **Final Expression**:
   - The final expression to evaluate is:
     \[
     \left(\frac{2b - k + 1}{2}\right) * k + (n - k) * a
     \]

6. **Output Description**:
   - The output will be the result of the above expression, where `n`, `a`, `b`, and `k` are determined by the user inputs.

Therefore, the output will be the evaluated result of the expression given the user inputs.

Output: **(2b - k + 1) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a (where k = min(n, b - a))**
