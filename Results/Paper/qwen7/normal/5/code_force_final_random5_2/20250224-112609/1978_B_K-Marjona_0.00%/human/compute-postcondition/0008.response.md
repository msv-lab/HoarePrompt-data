Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then `k` remains the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`. If `b` is greater than `a`, then `k` still remains the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.
