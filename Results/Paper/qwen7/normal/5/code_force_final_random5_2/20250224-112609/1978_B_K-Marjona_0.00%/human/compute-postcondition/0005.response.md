Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- The current value of `b` is less than or equal to `a`.
- `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(a * n)`.

First, let's analyze the expression `a * n`:
- `a` is an input integer.
- `n` is an input integer.

Since both `a` and `n` are explicitly defined as input integers, their values will be used directly in the multiplication.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the product of `a` and `n`.

Output: **a * n**
