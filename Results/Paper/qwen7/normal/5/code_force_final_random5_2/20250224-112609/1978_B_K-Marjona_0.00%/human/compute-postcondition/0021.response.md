Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `a` is the second integer entered by the user, `b` is the third integer entered by the user, and `k` is the minimum value between the new `n` and `b - a`. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, `k` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `k` is still the minimum value between the new `n` and `b - a`.
