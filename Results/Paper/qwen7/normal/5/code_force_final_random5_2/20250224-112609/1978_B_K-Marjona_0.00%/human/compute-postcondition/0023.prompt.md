Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of three positive integers n, a, and b, where n is the number of buns, a is the usual price of a bun, and b is the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price (0 ≤ k ≤ min(n, b)).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    k = min(n, b - a)
    if b <= a:
        print(a * n)
    else:
        print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, then `k` remains unchanged. If `b` is greater than `a`, then `k` remains unchanged as well.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the values entered by the user, and `k` is the minimum value between the new `n` and `b - a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is the first integer entered by the user, `a` is the second integer entered by the user, `b` is the third integer entered by the user, and `k` is the minimum value between the new `n` and `b - a`. Since the if condition `b <= a` is not met in the else part, `k` remains unchanged from its initial value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
