Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `range(int(input()))` expression. This means the loop will run for as many times as the integer input from the user.

2. **Determine the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `t` is a positive integer (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
   - `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the values entered by the user.
   - `k` is the minimum value between the new `n` and `b - a`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute based on the integer input from the user. The loop will stop when the user inputs a non-positive integer.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the user must input a positive integer. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from the previous iteration, and `k` will be recalculated based on the new `n` and `b - a`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- The user must input a positive integer for the loop to continue.

Given the constraints and the loop head, the states that need to be explicitly adjusted are `n`, `a`, `b`, and `k` (recalculated based on the new `n` and `b - a`).

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the values entered by the user, and `k` is the minimum value between the new `n` and `b - a`**.
