Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `k` is the minimum value between `n` and `b - a`, and `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated to the values entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input from the user and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively. The variable `k` remains unchanged as it was defined earlier based on the initial values of `n` and `b - a`. The initial state of `t` as a positive integer is preserved, and the other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, and `k`) are updated to the values provided by the user.
