#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")". The string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
        
    #State: Output State: The dictionary `d` will contain keys from `1` to `len(s)`, where each key's value is determined by the cumulative count of parentheses. Starting from `d[0] = 0`, for every opening parenthesis `(` encountered in the string `s`, the value increases by 1, and for every closing parenthesis `)` encountered, the value decreases by 1.
    #
    #For example, if the string `s` is `"((()))"`, after the loop completes, the dictionary `d` will look like this: `{0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 2, 5: 1, 6: 0}`. This indicates that starting from index 0, the count increases by 1 for each opening parenthesis and decreases by 1 for each closing parenthesis as we move through the string.
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State: Output State: The dictionary `d` is sorted based on the values associated with its keys, `i` is the last key in the sorted dictionary, `j` is the value associated with the last key in the sorted dictionary, `ans` is the sum of `s[i]` for all keys `i` in the dictionary `d`.
    #
    #In this final state, the dictionary `d` remains sorted based on the values of its keys. The variable `i` holds the key of the last element in the sorted dictionary, and `j` holds the corresponding value. The variable `ans` contains the cumulative sum of `s[i]` for every key `i` present in the dictionary `d`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the cumulative sum of `s[i]` for every key `i` present in the dictionary `d`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of "(" and ")" and returns a new string. This new string is constructed by selecting characters from `s` based on the sorted order of their corresponding positions in the cumulative count of parentheses. Specifically, it first calculates the cumulative count of parentheses, removes the last position from the dictionary, sorts the dictionary by its values, and then constructs the result string by concatenating characters from `s` at the sorted positions.
