### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the provided problem description and function summary.

1. **Problem Description and Function Summary Recap:**
   - The goal is to perform a balanced shuffle operation on a balanced parentheses sequence.
   - The function `func_1` should take a string `s` and return a new string `t` by sorting the positions based on the prefix balance and then constructing the result string using these sorted positions.

2. **Current Implementation Analysis:**
   - The function correctly computes the balance at each position and stores it in a dictionary.
   - However, the sorting step is problematic because it only sorts by balance and does not handle ties by position correctly.

3. **Corrected Implementation:**
   - To address the issue, we need to sort the dictionary items by balance in ascending order and by position in descending order for ties. This ensures that the positions with the same balance are handled correctly.

4. **Function `func_1` with Correct Sorting:**
   ```python
   def func_1(s):
       n = len(s)
       ans = ''
       d = {0: 0}
       for i in range(len(s)):
           if s[i] == '(':
               d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
           else:
               d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
       d.pop(n)
       # Sort by balance in ascending order and position in descending order for ties
       d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
       for (i, _) in d:
           ans += s[i]
       return ans
   ```

5. **Verification:**
   - The corrected implementation ensures that the positions are sorted correctly according to the problem requirements.
   - The function now properly handles ties by position, ensuring that the balanced shuffle operation is performed accurately.

### Conclusion

The original assessment was accurate. The given program does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation due to the issue with sorting. The corrected implementation provided above addresses this issue.

Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect.
