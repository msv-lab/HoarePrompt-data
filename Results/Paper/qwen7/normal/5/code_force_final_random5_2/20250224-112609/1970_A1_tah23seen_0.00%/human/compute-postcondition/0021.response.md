Output State: The dictionary `d` will cover indices from `0` to `n` (where `n` is the length of `s`), and each value in `d` will represent the net count of opening parentheses '(' up to that index. Specifically, `d[0]` starts at `0`, and for each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`, if `s[i]` is '(', `d[i+1]` will be `d[i] + 1`, otherwise `d[i+1]` will be `d[i] - 1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the dictionary `d` will contain the cumulative count of unmatched opening parentheses at each index of the string `s`.
