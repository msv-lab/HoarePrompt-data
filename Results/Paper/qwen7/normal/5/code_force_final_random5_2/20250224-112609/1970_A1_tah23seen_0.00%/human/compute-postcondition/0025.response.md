Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the tuple `(i, j)` which iterates over the dictionary `d`. This means that `i` and `j` are the variables being used in the loop.

2. **Understand the Dictionary `d`**: The dictionary `d` is sorted based on the values associated with its keys. This means that the key-value pairs are ordered such that the values are in ascending order.

3. **Determine the Initial State for the Loop**: When the loop starts, the first iteration will use the first key-value pair from the sorted dictionary. Therefore, `i` will be the first key and `j` will be the value associated with that key.

4. **Adjust the States**: Since the loop depends on the sorted nature of the dictionary, we need to ensure that the dictionary is in a state where it can be iterated over correctly. Additionally, we need to set the initial values of `i` and `j`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- The dictionary `d` should be in a sorted state based on its values.
- `i` should be the first key in the sorted dictionary.
- `j` should be the value associated with the first key in the sorted dictionary.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`d` is a sorted dictionary based on values, `i` is the first key in the sorted dictionary, `j` is the value associated with the first key in the sorted dictionary**
