Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined as follows:
   ```python
   for (i, j) in d:
   ```
   This means that `i` and `j` are the variables being iterated over from the dictionary `d`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `d` is a sorted dictionary based on values.
   - `i` is the second key in the sorted dictionary.
   - `j` is the value associated with the second key in the sorted dictionary.
   - `ans` is `ans` plus the value `s[i]`.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the next key-value pair in the dictionary `d` must be accessed.
   - Since `i` was the second key in the previous iteration, the next key will be the third key in the sorted dictionary.
   - The corresponding value `j` will be the value associated with the third key.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will now be the third key in the sorted dictionary.
   - `j` will be the value associated with the third key in the sorted dictionary.
   - No changes are needed for `ans` or `d` since they are not part of the loop head and their values are not directly modified within the loop head.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`d` is a sorted dictionary based on values, `i` is the third key in the sorted dictionary, `j` is the value associated with the third key in the sorted dictionary, `ans` is `ans` plus the value `s[i]`**
