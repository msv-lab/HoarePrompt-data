Output State: **The dictionary `d` is sorted based on the values associated with its keys.**

Explanation: The code sorts the dictionary `d` based on its values (which represent the cumulative count of parentheses) using the `sorted()` function with a lambda function as the key parameter. This means that the dictionary `d` will now have its items ordered by their values in ascending order. The keys and their corresponding values remain the same, but the order of the key-value pairs in the dictionary changes.
