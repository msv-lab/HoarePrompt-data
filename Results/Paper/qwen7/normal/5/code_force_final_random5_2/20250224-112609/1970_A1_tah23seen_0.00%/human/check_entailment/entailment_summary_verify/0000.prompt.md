You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program:
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of "(" and ")" and returns a new string. This new string is constructed by selecting characters from `s` based on the sorted order of their corresponding positions in the cumulative count of parentheses. Specifically, it first calculates the cumulative count of parentheses, removes the last position from the dictionary, sorts the dictionary by its values, and then constructs the result string by concatenating characters from `s` at the sorted positions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation. Specifically, the issue lies in how the dictionary `d` is being used and sorted. The dictionary `d` is built to store the prefix balance at each position, but the sorting step does not correctly handle the positions in descending order when there are ties in prefix balance.

For example, consider the input `(()(()))`. The correct balanced shuffle should be `()(()())`, but the current implementation might produce an incorrect result due to the way the dictionary is sorted.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = [(0, 0)]  # Start with a dummy entry for balance 0 at position 0
    balance = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        d.append((balance, i))
    
    d.sort()  # Sort by balance, breaking ties by position in descending order
    
    for (_, pos) in d:
        ans += s[pos]
    
    return ans

n = input()
print(func_1(n))
```

This corrected version ensures that the positions are sorted correctly, maintaining the required order for the balanced shuffle operation.
