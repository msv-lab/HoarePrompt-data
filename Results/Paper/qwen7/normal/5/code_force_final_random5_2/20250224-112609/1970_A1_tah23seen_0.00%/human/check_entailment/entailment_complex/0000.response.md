Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the input string `s` which is a balanced parentheses sequence.
2. The function `func_1` calculates the prefix balance for each position in the string `s` and stores these balances in a dictionary `d`. This part is correct.
3. After removing the last entry from the dictionary (which corresponds to the last character in the string), the dictionary is sorted based on the values (prefix balances). This step is also correct.
4. The function then constructs the result string `ans` by appending characters from `s` based on the sorted order of their corresponding positions in the dictionary `d`. This is done correctly by iterating over the sorted items in the dictionary and appending the corresponding characters from `s` to `ans`.
5. Finally, the function returns the constructed string `ans`.

Given the steps and the logic described, the program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as defined in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
