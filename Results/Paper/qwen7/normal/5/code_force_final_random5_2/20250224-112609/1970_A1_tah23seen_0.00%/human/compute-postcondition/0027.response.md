Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined as `for (i, j) in d`. This means the loop iterates over each key-value pair in the dictionary `d`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `d` is a sorted dictionary based on values.
   - `i` is the first key in the sorted dictionary.
   - `j` is the value associated with the first key in the sorted dictionary.
   - `ans` is `ans` plus the value `s[i]`.

3. **Determine the next state for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute again if there are more key-value pairs in the dictionary `d`.
   - After the current iteration, `i` and `j` will refer to the next key-value pair in the sorted dictionary.
   - Since `d` is sorted based on values, the next key-value pair will be the second smallest value in the dictionary.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will now be the second key in the sorted dictionary.
   - `j` will now be the value associated with the second key in the sorted dictionary.
   - The state of `ans` remains unchanged as it is not directly affected by the loop head but by the loop body, which is omitted here.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`d` is a sorted dictionary based on values, `i` is the second key in the sorted dictionary, `j` is the value associated with the second key in the sorted dictionary, `ans` is `ans` plus the value `s[i]`**.
