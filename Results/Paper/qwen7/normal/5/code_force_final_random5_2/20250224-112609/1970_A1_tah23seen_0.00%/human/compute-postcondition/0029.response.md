Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `(i, j) in d`. This means the loop iterates over each key-value pair in the dictionary `d`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `d` is a sorted dictionary based on values.
   - `i` is the second key in the sorted dictionary.
   - `j` is the value associated with the second key in the sorted dictionary.
   - `ans` is `ans` plus the value `s[i]`.

3. **Determine the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, it needs to get the next key-value pair from the dictionary `d`.
   - Since `i` is currently the second key, the next key will be the third key in the sorted dictionary.
   - The corresponding value for this new key will be the value associated with the third key.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will now be the third key in the sorted dictionary.
   - `j` will be the value associated with the third key in the sorted dictionary.

5. **No change to `ans` or `s`**: The state of `ans` and `s` remains the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration because the loop body is omitted and no changes are made to these variables within the loop.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `d` is a sorted dictionary based on values, `i` is the third key in the sorted dictionary, `j` is the value associated with the third key in the sorted dictionary, `ans` is `ans` plus the value `s[i]`**.
