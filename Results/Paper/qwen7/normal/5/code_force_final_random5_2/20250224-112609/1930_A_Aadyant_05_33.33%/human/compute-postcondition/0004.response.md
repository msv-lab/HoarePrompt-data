Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `num` is a positive integer, `out` is an empty list, `numbers` is 0, `list1` is an empty list, `list2` is an empty list.**

The code initializes `list1` as an empty list. This does not affect the values of `t`, `num`, `out`, `numbers`, or `list2`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
