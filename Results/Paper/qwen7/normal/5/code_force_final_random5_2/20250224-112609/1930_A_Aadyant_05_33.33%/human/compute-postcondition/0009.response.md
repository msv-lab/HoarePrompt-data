Output State: **`list1` is sorted, `num` is a positive integer, `out` is an empty list, `numbers` is 0, `list2` is an empty list, `a` is the input string converted to an integer, and `b` is the input string.**

The code `list1.sort()` sorts the list `list1`. Since sorting a list modifies it in place, the only change is that `list1` is now sorted. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
