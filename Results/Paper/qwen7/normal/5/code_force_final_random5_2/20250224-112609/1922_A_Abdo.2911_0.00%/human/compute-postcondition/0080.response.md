Output State: **`match_a_b` is True, `match_c` is False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `match_a_b` and `match_c`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since no such context is provided, we assume it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `match_a_b` and `match_c` remain unchanged.
