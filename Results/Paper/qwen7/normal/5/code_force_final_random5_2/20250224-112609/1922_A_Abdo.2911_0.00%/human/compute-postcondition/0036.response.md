Output State: **`match_a_b` is False, `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `match_a_b`, `i`, or `n`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since no new assignments or changes to these variables are made, their values remain the same. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged values of `match_a_b`, `i`, and `n`, along with the indication that a break statement was executed.
