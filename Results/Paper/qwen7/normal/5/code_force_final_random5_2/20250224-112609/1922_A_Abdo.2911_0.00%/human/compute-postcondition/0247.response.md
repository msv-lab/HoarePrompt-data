Output State: **`match_a_b` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and either `a[i]` or `b[i]` is equal to the corresponding character in `template` when both are converted to lowercase.**

Explanation: The variable `match_a_b` is explicitly set to `False`. The values of `i`, `n`, and the condition regarding `a[i]` and `b[i]` relative to `template` remain unchanged from the initial state.
