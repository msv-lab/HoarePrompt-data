Postcondition: `match_a_b` is `True`, `match_c` is either `True` or `False`, `c` is an input string after stripping whitespace, `template` is a list containing either `a[i]` (if `a[i]` equals `b[i]`) or the uppercase version of `a[i]` (if `a[i]` does not equal `b[i]`), `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 0.
