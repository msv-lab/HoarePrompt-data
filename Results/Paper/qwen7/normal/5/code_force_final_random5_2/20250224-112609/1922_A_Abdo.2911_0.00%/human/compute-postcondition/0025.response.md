Output State: **`match_a_b` is `True`.**

Explanation: The code `match_a_b = True` assigns the value `True` to the variable `match_a_b`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, or the `template` list. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for these variables while updating `match_a_b` to `True`.
