Postcondition: `match_c` is True, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. If the first character of `template` is not a lowercase letter, then the first character of `template` is not a lowercase letter. If the lowercase version of `c[0]` equals the lowercase version of `template[0]`, then `match_c` remains True, `i` becomes 1, and the first character of `template` is not a lowercase letter. If the condition is not met, `match_c` remains True, `i` remains 0, and the first character of `template` is not a lowercase letter.
