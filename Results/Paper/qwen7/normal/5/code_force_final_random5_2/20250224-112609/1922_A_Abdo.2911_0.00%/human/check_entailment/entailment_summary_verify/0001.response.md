### Reasoning:

1. **Template Construction**:
   - The function constructs a template based on the characters of `a` and `b`. If the characters at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, it appends the character from `a` directly to the template. If they are different, it appends the uppercase version of `a[i]` to the template. This ensures that both `a` and `b` will match the template if the conditions are met.

2. **Matching Conditions**:
   - For `a` and `b` to match the template:
     - If the character in the template is lowercase, the corresponding character in `a` or `b` must match.
     - If the character in the template is uppercase, the corresponding character in `a` or `b` must not match the lowercase version of the template character.
   - For `c` to not match the template:
     - If the character in the template is lowercase, the corresponding character in `c` must not match.
     - If the character in the template is uppercase, the corresponding character in `c` must match the lowercase version of the template character.

3. **Checking Conditions**:
   - The function checks if `a` and `b` match the constructed template by iterating through each character and ensuring the conditions are met.
   - It also checks if `c` does not match the template under the same conditions.

4. **Output**:
   - If both `a` and `b` match the template but `c` does not, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Analysis:
- The logic for constructing the template and checking the matching conditions seems correct based on the problem statement.
- However, there is a potential issue in the way the template is checked against `a` and `b`. Specifically, the function should ensure that both `a` and `b` match the template, not just one of them.

### Example Analysis:
- **Test Case 1**:
  - Input:
    ```
    4
    1
    a
    b
    c
    2
    aa
    bb
    aa
    10
    mathforces
    luckforces
    adhoccoder
    3
    acc
    abd
    abc
    ```
  - Expected Output:
    ```
    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    ```

- **Issue in Test Case 2**:
  - In the second test case, `aa` and `bb` match the template `"AA"`, but `aa` does not match the template because it should have been `"BB"` to satisfy the condition for both `a` and `b`.

### Corrected Template Check:
To ensure that both `a` and `b` match the template, we need to modify the template check logic. Specifically, we should ensure that both `a` and `b` match the template before checking `c`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        template = []
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                template.append(a[i])
            else:
                template.append(a[i].upper())
        
        # Check if both a and b match the template
        match_a_b = True
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
                    match_a_b = False
                    break
            elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
                match_a_b = False
                break
        
        if not match_a_b:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        # Check if c does not match the template
        match_c = True
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if c[i] == template[i]:
                    match_c = False
                    break
            elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
                match_c = False
                break
        
        if match_c:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was **inaccurate** because the function does not correctly ensure that both `a` and `b` match the template before checking `c`. The corrected code ensures this condition is met.

**Final: False**
