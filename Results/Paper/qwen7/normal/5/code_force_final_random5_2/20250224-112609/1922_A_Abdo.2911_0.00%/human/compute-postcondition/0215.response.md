Output State: **`match_c` is True, `i` is 3, `a` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace**

Explanation: The code assigns the stripped input string to the variable `a`. The values of `match_c` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. The input integer `n` is not used in this snippet, so its state remains as an input integer. The input string `a` now holds the value of the user's input, stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.
