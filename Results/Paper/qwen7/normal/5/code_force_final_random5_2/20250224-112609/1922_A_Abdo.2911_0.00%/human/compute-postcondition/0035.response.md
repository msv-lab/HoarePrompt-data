Output State: **`match_a_b` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `template[i]` is not a lowercase character, either `a[i]` or `b[i]` is in lowercase and matches `template[i]` in lowercase**

Explanation: The code sets `match_a_b` to `False`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `template[i]`, `a[i]`, and `b[i]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
