Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `template` is a list.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in `range(n)`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 3 in the next iteration.

5. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
   - Since `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` is now 3, `n` must still be greater than 3 for the loop to execute one more time.

6. **Adjusting the States:**
   - We need to ensure that `i` is set to 3 and `n` is greater than 3.

Therefore, the updated states at the start of the next iteration of the loop are:
- `i` is 3.
- `n` must be greater than 3.

Since the `template` list is not directly modified within the loop head (it is modified inside the loop body), we do not need to adjust its state here.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
