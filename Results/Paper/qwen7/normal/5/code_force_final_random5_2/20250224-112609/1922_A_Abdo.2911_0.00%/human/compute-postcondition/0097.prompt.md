Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `match_a_b` is True, `match_c` is True, `i` is `n-1`
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if template[i].islower():
        if c[i] != template[i]:
            match_c = False
            break
    elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
        match_c = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `match_a_b` is True, `match_c` is True if the character at index `i` in `c` matches the character at the same index in `template` (ignoring case). Otherwise, `match_c` is False. The value of `i` remains `n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `match_a_b` is True, and `match_c` is determined as follows: if the character at index `i` in `c` does not match the character at the same index in `template` (ignoring case), `match_c` is False. Otherwise, `match_c` is True. The value of `i` remains `n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `match_a_b` is True, `match_c` is determined based on the lowercase check of `template[i]`. If `template[i]` is lowercase and does not match the corresponding character in `c` (ignoring case), `match_c` is False. Otherwise, `match_c` remains True and `i` is `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
