Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2; `template` has an additional element `a[2]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `a[i]` to the list `template`. Given that `i` is 2, `template` now includes the element `a[2]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
