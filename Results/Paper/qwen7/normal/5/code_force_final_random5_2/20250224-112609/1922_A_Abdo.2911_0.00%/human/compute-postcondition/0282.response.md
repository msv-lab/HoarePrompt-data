Output State: **`match_c` is False, `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified, the `break` statement is interpreted as breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `match_c` and `i` remain unchanged.
