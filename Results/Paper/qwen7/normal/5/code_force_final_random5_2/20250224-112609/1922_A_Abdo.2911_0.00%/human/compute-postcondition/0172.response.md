Output State: **`match_c` is False, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `template[i]` is a lowercase character, the current value of `c[i]` is not equal to the current value of `template[i]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `match_c`, `i`, `n`, `template[i]`, or `c[i]`. It only indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no new assignments or changes are made to these variables, their states remain as they were in the initial state.
