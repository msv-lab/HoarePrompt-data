Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `t`**: According to the problem, `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, it will always be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `t` meets this condition. Given that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, the initial state already satisfies this condition.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the state of `t` because it is guaranteed to be greater than 0 based on the given constraints.

**State:**
**`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive**
