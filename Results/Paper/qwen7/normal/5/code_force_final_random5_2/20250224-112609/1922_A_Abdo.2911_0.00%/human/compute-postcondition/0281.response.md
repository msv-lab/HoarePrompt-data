Output State: **`match_c` is False, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `template[i]` is a lowercase character, the current value of `c[i]` is not equal to the current value of `template[i]`**

Explanation: The line `match_c = False` simply assigns the value `False` to the variable `match_c`. None of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `template[i]`, `c[i]`) are affected by this assignment. Therefore, their previous states remain unchanged.
