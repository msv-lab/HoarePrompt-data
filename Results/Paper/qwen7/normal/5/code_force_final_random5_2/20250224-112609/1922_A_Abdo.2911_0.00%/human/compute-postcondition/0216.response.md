Output State: **`match_c` is True, `i` is 3, `a` is an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is a string obtained by stripping leading and trailing whitespace from the input.**

Explanation: The code `b = input().strip()` takes an input from the user, strips any leading and trailing whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `b`. The values of `match_c` and `i` remain unchanged, and `a` is still an input string stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, which is preserved as part of the initial state.
