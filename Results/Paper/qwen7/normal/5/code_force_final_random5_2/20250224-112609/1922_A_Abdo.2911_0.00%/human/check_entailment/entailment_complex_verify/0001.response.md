### Reasoning:

1. **Template Construction**:
   - The function correctly constructs the template based on the characters of `a` and `b`. If the characters at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, it appends the character from `a` directly to the template. If they are different, it appends the uppercase version of `a[i]` to the template. This ensures that both `a` and `b` will match the template if the conditions are met.

2. **Matching Conditions**:
   - For `a` and `b` to match the template:
     - If the character in the template is lowercase, the corresponding character in `a` or `b` must match.
     - If the character in the template is uppercase, the corresponding character in `a` or `b` must not match the lowercase version of the template character.
   - For `c` to not match the template:
     - If the character in the template is lowercase, the corresponding character in `c` must not match.
     - If the character in the template is uppercase, the corresponding character in `c` must match the lowercase version of the template character.

3. **Checking Conditions**:
   - The function checks if `a` and `b` match the constructed template by iterating through each character and ensuring the conditions are met.
   - It also checks if `c` does not match the template under the same conditions.

4. **Output**:
   - If both `a` and `b` match the template but `c` does not, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Analysis:
- The logic for constructing the template and checking the matching conditions seems correct based on the problem statement.
- The implementation handles the conditions for both `a`, `b`, and `c` correctly.
- The examples provided in the problem statement are correctly handled by the function.

However, there is a subtle issue in the implementation of the matching conditions for `a` and `b`. Specifically, the code checks if `a[i]` or `b[i]` matches the template character when the template character is lowercase, which is correct. However, the code incorrectly checks if `a[i].lower()` or `b[i].lower()` matches the template character when the template character is uppercase. This is because the problem requires that if the template character is uppercase, `a[i]` or `b[i]` should not match the lowercase version of the template character.

### Detailed Explanation:
- In the annotated code, the line `elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i].lower():` should be changed to `elif a[i] != template[i].lower() or b[i] != template[i].lower():`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        template = []
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                template.append(a[i])
            else:
                template.append(a[i].upper())
        match_a_b = True
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
                    match_a_b = False
                    break
            elif a[i] != template[i].lower() or b[i] != template[i].lower():
                match_a_b = False
                break
        match_c = True
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if c[i] != template[i]:
                    match_c = False
                    break
            elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
                match_c = False
                break
        if match_a_b and not match_c:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was almost correct, but there is a small mistake in the implementation of the matching conditions for `a` and `b`. The corrected code should handle the conditions correctly.

### Final:
**False**
