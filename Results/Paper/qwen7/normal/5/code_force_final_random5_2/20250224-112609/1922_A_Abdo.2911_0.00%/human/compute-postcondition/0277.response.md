Output State: **`match_c` is True**.

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value `True` to the variable `match_c`. Since no other operations are performed on `match_c` or any other variables, the only change is that `match_c` is now `True`. The initial state of `match_a_b` and its conditions remain unchanged.
