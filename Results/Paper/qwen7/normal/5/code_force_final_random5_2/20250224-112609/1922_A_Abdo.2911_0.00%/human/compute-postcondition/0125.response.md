Postcondition: `match_a_b` is `True`, `match_c` is either `True` or `False`, `c` is an input string after stripping whitespace, `template` is a list that includes at least the first element being either `a[4]` or its uppercase version depending on whether `a[4]` equals `b[4]`, and if `a[4] == b[4]`, the second element is `a[4]`, otherwise, the third element is `a[4].upper()`, `i` is 5, and `n` must be greater than 0.
