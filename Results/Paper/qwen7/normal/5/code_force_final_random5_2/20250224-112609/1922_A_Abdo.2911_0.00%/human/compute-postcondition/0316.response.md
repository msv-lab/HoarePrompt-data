Output State: **`match_c` is either True or False, `i` is equal to `n`, and `n` is greater than 0.**

In the final output state after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `match_c` will retain its last determined value, which is `True` if no mismatches were found throughout the entire loop (ignoring case differences for lowercase letters) or `False` if any mismatch was found. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations from `0` to `n-1`. The value of `n` remains unchanged and is assumed to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.
