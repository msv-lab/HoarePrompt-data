Output State: `match_c` is True, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than 3.

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations without encountering any mismatches between the characters in `template` and `c`. The variable `i` has been incremented to 3, indicating that the loop has checked each character up to index 2 (since indexing starts at 0). The condition `match_c` remains True, meaning that all characters up to the last checked index (2) matched the criteria specified in the loop body. Additionally, the value of `n` must be greater than 3 to ensure there were at least 4 elements to check in the loop.
