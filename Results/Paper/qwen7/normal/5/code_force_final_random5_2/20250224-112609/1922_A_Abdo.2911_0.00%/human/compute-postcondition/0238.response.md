State: **`match_a_b` is True, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 (since `range(n)` will generate numbers from 0 to `n-1`).
3. The variable `i` starts at 0 when the loop begins.
4. The initial state of `match_a_b` being `True` does not affect the loop's execution condition, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` set to 0 and `n` must be greater than 0.
