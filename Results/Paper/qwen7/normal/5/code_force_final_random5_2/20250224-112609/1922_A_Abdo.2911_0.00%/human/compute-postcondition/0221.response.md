Output State: **`i` is 0 or 1; `n` is a positive integer; `template` contains the value of `a[i]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `template`. Since `i` can be either 0 or 1, `a[i]` will be either `a[0]` or `a[1]`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The variable `template` now includes the value of `a[i]`.
