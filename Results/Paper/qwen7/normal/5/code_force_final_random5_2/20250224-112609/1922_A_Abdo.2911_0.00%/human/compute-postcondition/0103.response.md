The only object in the loop head is the variable `t`, which controls the number of iterations of the loop. The variables `match_a_b` and `match_c` are modified within the loop body, but their initial states at the start of each iteration are determined by the conditions specified.

Given the condition `match_a_b and (not match_c)` determines whether `match_c` remains `False` or becomes `True`, we need to consider the possible states for `match_a_b` and `match_c` at the start of the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `match_a_b` is `True`.
- `match_c` is either `True` or `False`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is not modified within the loop, its value remains the same for the next iteration.

Considering the condition `match_a_b and (not match_c)`:
- If `match_c` was `True` at the end of the previous iteration, then `match_a_b and (not match_c)` would be `False`, and `match_c` would remain `True` at the start of the next iteration.
- If `match_c` was `False` at the end of the previous iteration, then `match_a_b and (not match_c)` would be `True`, and `match_c` would become `False` at the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, the possible states for `match_c` at the start of the next iteration depend on its state at the end of the previous iteration. However, since we cannot predict the exact state of `match_c` without knowing the loop body, we can only express the possible states.

State: **`match_a_b` is `True`, `match_c` is either `True` or `False`**
