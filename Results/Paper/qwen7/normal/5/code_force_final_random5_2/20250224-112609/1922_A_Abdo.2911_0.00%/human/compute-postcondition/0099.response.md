Based on the initial state provided:

- `match_a_b` is `True`.
- `match_c` is either `True` or `False` depending on the comparison of characters in `c` and `template` throughout the entire loop, but currently it is `False`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This `print` statement outputs the string `'YES'` directly, regardless of the values of `match_a_b` and `match_c`.

Output: **YES**
