Output State: **`match_c` is False, `i` is 1 or incremented such that it is still less than `n`.**

Explanation: The variable `match_c` is explicitly set to `False`. The variable `i` was initially `1` or incremented to a value less than `n`, but the code does not modify `i`. Therefore, `i` remains in its original condition of being `1` or incremented to a value less than `n`.
