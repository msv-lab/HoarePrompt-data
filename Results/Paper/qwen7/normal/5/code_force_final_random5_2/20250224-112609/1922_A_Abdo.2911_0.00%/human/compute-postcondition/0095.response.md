Postcondition: `match_a_b` is True, `match_c` is determined based on whether the character at index `i` in `c` matches the character at the same index in `template` (ignoring case). If the character at index `i` in `c` matches the character at the same index in `template`, `match_c` is True and `i` is `n`; otherwise, `match_c` is False.
