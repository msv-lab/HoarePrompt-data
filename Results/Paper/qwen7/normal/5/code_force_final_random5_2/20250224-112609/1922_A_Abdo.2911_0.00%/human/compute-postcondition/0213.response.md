Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the `range(t)` part of the for loop. The variables involved in this loop are `_` (a placeholder variable), and the loop itself does not directly modify `match_c`, `i`, or `n`. However, the loop condition is based on the value of `t`.

2. **Determine the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `match_c` is True, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than 3. These values do not change within the loop body since they are not modified in the given information.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is not explicitly modified within the loop, the only way to ensure the loop continues is to decrease `t` by 1.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `t` while keeping `match_c`, `i`, and `n` unchanged.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`match_c` is True, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, and `t` must be greater than 0**.
