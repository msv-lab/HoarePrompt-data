Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `match_a_b` is `True`, `match_c` is either `True` or `False`, `c` is an input string after stripping whitespace, `template` is a list containing elements from `a` and their uppercase versions based on comparison with `b` for each index up to `n-1`, `i` is `n`, and `n` must be greater than 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if template[i].islower():
        if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
            match_a_b = False
            break
    elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i
        ].lower():
        match_a_b = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and the character at index `i` in `template` is either a lowercase letter where neither `a[i]` nor `b[i]` matches it, or it is not a lowercase letter where either `a[i]` or `b[i]` matches it when converted to lowercase. If the condition in the if statement is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and the character at index `i` in `template` is either a lowercase letter where neither `a[i]` nor `b[i]` matches it, or it is not a lowercase letter where either `a[i]` or `b[i]` matches it when converted to lowercase. In both the if and else cases, if the condition `a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and the character at index `i` in `template` is either a lowercase letter where neither `a[i]` nor `b[i]` matches it, or it is not a lowercase letter where either `a[i]` or `b[i]` matches it when converted to lowercase. If the condition `a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
