Output State: **`match_a_b` is `True`, `match_c` is either `True` or `False`, `c` is an input string after stripping whitespace, `template` is a list where the first element is either `a[i]` or its uppercase version depending on whether `a[i]` equals `b[i]` and now includes `a[i]` as its second element, `i` is 3, and `n` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `template.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `template`. Given that `i` was initially 2, after appending `a[i]`, `i` increments to 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
