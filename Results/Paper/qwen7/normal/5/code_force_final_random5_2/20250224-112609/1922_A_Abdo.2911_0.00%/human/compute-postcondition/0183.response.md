Postcondition: `match_c` is True, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current character in `template` at index `i` is either a lowercase character where it matches `c[i]` or it is not a lowercase character. If the characters do not match (when the character in `template` is not lowercase), the postcondition remains as initially described.
