Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < t`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces.
   - If `a < b < c` holds true, then the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `b` becomes the maximum value among `a`, `b`, and `c`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged because it is the upper limit of the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is 1.
- `t` remains the same (an integer between 1 and 1000).
- `a`, `b`, and `c` retain their values from the previous iteration based on the condition.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` retain their values from the previous iteration**.
