Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values of three integers entered by the user.**

The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
