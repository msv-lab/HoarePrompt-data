Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 999 (since the loop runs `t` times), `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values of three integers entered by the user during the last iteration of the loop. If `a < b < c` is true during the last iteration, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.
    #
    #This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `t` will be equal to the initial input integer, `i` will be `t-1`, and `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold the values from the last set of inputs provided by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes up to 1000 test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) within the range [0, 9]. For each test case, it prints one of three strings: "STAIR" if \(a < b < c\), "PEAK" if \(b\) is the maximum value among \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), and "NONE" otherwise. After processing all test cases, it outputs nothing and ends.
