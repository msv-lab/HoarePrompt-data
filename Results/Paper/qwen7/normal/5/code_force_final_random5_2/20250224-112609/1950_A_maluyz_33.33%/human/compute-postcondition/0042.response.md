Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values of three integers entered by the user. If `a`, `b`, and `c` are all equal, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Otherwise, if the maximum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is not equal to `b`, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.
