Functionality: **The function processes up to 1000 test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) within the range [0, 9]. For each test case, it prints one of three strings: "STAIR" if \(a < b < c\), "PEAK" if \(b\) is the maximum value among \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), and "NONE" otherwise. After processing all test cases, it outputs nothing and ends.**
