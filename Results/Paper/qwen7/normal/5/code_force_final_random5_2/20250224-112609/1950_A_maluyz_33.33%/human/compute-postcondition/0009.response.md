Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
- `i` is 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned the values from the input split by spaces.
- Either `a` is greater than or equal to `b` or `b` is greater than or equal to `c`.
- The current value of `a`, `b`, and `c` is such that `a` is equal to `b` and `b` is equal to `c`.

Given these conditions, the print statement `print('NONE')` will simply print the string `'NONE'`.

Output: **NONE**
