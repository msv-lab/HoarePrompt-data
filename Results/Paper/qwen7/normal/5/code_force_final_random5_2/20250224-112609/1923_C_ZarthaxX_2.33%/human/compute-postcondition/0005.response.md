Output State: **`ones[i]` is updated to `ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)`**.

This means that the value of `ones[i]` is set to the value of `ones[i - 1]` plus 1 if `nums[i - 1]` is equal to 1, otherwise it is set to the value of `ones[i - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
