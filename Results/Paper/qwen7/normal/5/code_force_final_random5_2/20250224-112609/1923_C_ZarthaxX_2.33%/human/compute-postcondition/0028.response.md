Postcondition: `q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer from input; `r` is an integer from input; `sumInRange` is the sum of integers from index `l-1` to `r`; `onesInRange` is the difference between `ones[r]` and `ones[l - 1]` if `l` is not equal to `r`. If the condition `(2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange) <= sumInRange` is satisfied, then the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange > sumInRange` holds true.
