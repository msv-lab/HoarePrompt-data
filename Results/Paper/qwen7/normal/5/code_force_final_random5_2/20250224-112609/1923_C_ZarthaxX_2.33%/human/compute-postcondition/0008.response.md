Output State: **`ones[i]` is `ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)`, `i` is `n + 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ones[i]` based on the value of `ones[i - 1]` and the condition involving `nums[i - 1]`. The value of `i` remains `n + 1` from the initial state, and `ones[i]` is set to the sum of `ones[i - 1]` and 1 if `nums[i - 1]` is 1, otherwise it is just `ones[i - 1]`.
