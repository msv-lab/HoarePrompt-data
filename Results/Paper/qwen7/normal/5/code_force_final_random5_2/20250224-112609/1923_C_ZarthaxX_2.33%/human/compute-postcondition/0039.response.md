Postcondition: **`onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `q` must be greater than or equal to 0, `l` and `r` are assigned the values from input split by space, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`. If the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is true, the program continues under this condition. Otherwise, the program continues under the same conditions without any changes.**
