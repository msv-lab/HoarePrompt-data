Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code reads two integers, `n` and `q`, from the input using the `map` function and `int` conversion. These values replace the previous values of `n` and `q`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and is still a positive integer.
