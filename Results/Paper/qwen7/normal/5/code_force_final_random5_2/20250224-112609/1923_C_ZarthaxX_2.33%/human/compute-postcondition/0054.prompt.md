You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer; for each test case, n and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5; c is a list of n positive integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive; for each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split(' '))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ones = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    sum = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        ones[i] = ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)
        
        sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `ones[i]` will contain the cumulative count of 1s in the `nums` list up to each index `i`, and `sum[i]` will contain the cumulative sum of the elements in `nums` up to each index `i`, adjusted by subtracting 1 at each step.
    #
    #In more detail:
    #- `ones[i]` will be the total number of 1s in the `nums` list from index 0 to index `i`.
    #- `sum[i]` will be the cumulative sum of the elements in `nums` from index 0 to index `i`, but each element is decremented by 1 before adding to the cumulative sum.
    #
    #This means that after the loop completes, `ones[n]` will give the total count of 1s in `nums`, and `sum[n]` will give the adjusted cumulative sum of the elements in `nums`.
    for _ in range(q):
        l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))
        
        if l == r:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
        
        sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
        
        if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `ones[i]` will contain the cumulative count of 1s in the `nums` list up to each index `i`, and `sum[i]` will contain the cumulative sum of the elements in `nums` up to each index `i`, adjusted by subtracting 1 at each step. This means that `ones[n]` will give the total count of 1s in `nums`, and `sum[n]` will give the adjusted cumulative sum of the elements in `nums`.
    #
    #In more detail, after the loop completes, for every index `i` from 0 to `n`:
    #- `ones[i]` will store the total number of 1s in the `nums` list from index 0 to index `i`.
    #- `sum[i]` will store the cumulative sum of the elements in `nums` from index 0 to index `i`, with each element decremented by 1 before adding to the cumulative sum.
    #
    #The values of `q`, `l`, and `r` will reflect the final state after all iterations of the loop have been executed, with `q` being decremented by 1 for each iteration where `l` is not equal to `r`. The conditions checked within the loop will be evaluated based on the updated values of `ones` and `sum` arrays.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list `c` of n positive integers and handles q queries. For each query, it checks a range from index l_i to r_i within the list `c` and returns the sum of elements within that range.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
