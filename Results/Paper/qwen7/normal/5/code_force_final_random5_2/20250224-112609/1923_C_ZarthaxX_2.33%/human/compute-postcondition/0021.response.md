Output State: **`q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer from input; `r` is an integer from input; `onesInRange` is the difference between `ones[r]` and `ones[l - 1]` if `l` is not equal to `r`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `onesInRange` as the difference between `ones[r]` and `ones[l - 1]`. This calculation is only performed if `l` is not equal to `r`. If `l` equals `r`, the loop continues without updating any variables. Therefore, the values of `q`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged, and `onesInRange` is calculated based on the given condition.
