You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

- Program:
import math

testCases = int(input())
for i in range(testCases):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, q) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ones = [0 for i in range(n + 1)]
    sum = [0 for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        ones[i] = ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)
        sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1
    for _ in range(q):
        (l, r) = map(int, input().split(' '))
        if l == r:
            print('NO')
            continue
        onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
        sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
        if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a list of positive integers and handles multiple queries. It calculates the cumulative count of 1s and the adjusted cumulative sum of elements up to each index in the list. For each query, it checks if a specific condition is met based on the range of indices provided and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. After processing all queries, the function does not return any value but modifies the internal state of the `ones` and `sum` lists to reflect the cumulative counts and sums.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- An array \(a\) of length \(m\) is considered "good" if there exists another array \(b\) of the same length such that:
  1. The sums of the elements of \(a\) and \(b\) are equal.
  2. \(a_i \neq b_i\) for every index \(i\) from 1 to \(m\).
  3. \(b_i > 0\) for every index \(i\) from 1 to \(m\).

- We need to check if a subarray of the given array \(c\) is "good".

### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - It processes each test case by reading \(n\) and \(q\), followed by the array \(c\), and then \(q\) queries.

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - The program calculates two arrays `ones` and `sum`:
     - `ones[i]` stores the count of 1s in the subarray \(c[0:i]\).
     - `sum[i]` stores the sum of the subarray \(c[0:i]\) minus the count of 1s in it.
   - These calculations are done in linear time, which is efficient given the constraints.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program checks if the subarray is "good":
     - If the subarray has only one element, it prints "NO".
     - Otherwise, it calculates the number of 1s (`onesInRange`) and the sum adjusted by the count of 1s (`sumInRange`) in the queried subarray.
     - It then checks if the condition \(2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (\text{r} - \text{l} + 1) - \text{onesInRange} \leq \text{sumInRange}\) holds.
       - Simplifying the condition, we get \( \text{onesInRange} + (\text{r} - \text{l} + 1) \leq \text{sumInRange} \).
       - This condition ensures that there are enough non-1 elements to form a "good" subarray \(b\).

### Correctness Analysis:
- The preprocessing step is correct and efficient.
- The query processing logic is correct and follows the necessary conditions for a subarray to be "good".
- The program handles edge cases (e.g., single-element subarrays) appropriately.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
