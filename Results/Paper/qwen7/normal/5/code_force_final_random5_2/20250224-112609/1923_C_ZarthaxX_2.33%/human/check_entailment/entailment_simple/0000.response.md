Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if a subarray is "good" based on specific conditions.
2. The annotated program correctly initializes variables and processes the input data.
3. The program calculates the cumulative counts of 1s (`ones`) and the adjusted cumulative sums (`sum`) for the entire array.
4. For each query, it checks if the subarray is good by comparing the conditions specified in the problem statement.
5. The logic in the program appears to be correct:
   - It correctly handles the case when `l == r` by printing "NO".
   - It calculates the number of 1s and the adjusted sum for the queried subarray.
   - It uses these values to check if the subarray meets the criteria for being "good".

Given the above points, the annotated program seems to correctly implement the solution for the problem.

Correctness: **True**
