Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i`.
2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` until `i < n + 1`.
3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `q` is an input integer.
- `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer.
- `ones` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.
- `sum` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.

The only object in the loop head that needs adjustment is `i`. For the loop to start executing, `i` should be initialized to 1 (the starting value of the loop).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` being set to 1.

**State:**
**`i` is 1, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `ones` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `sum` is a list of `n + 1` zeros**
