Based on the initial state provided:

- `onesInRange` is calculated as `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`.
- `q` is a variable that must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `l` and `r` are assigned values from input split by space.
- `sumInRange` is calculated as `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This print statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`, regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **'NO'**
