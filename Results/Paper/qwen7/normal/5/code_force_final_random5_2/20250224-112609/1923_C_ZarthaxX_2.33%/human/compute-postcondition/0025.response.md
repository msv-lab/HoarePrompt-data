Postcondition: **`q` must be greater than 0; `l` is an integer from input; `r` is an integer from input; `sumInRange` is the sum of integers from index `l-1` to `r`; `onesInRange` is the difference between `ones[r]` and `ones[l - 1]` if `l` is not equal to `r`. The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange > sumInRange` holds true.**
