Output State: **`onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `q` is `q - 1`, `l` and `r` are integers from input split by space, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code `sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]` does not change any of the existing variables. It simply reassigns the value of `sumInRange` based on the same formula it already had. Therefore, the values of `onesInRange`, `q`, `l`, `r`, and the expression for `sumInRange` remain unchanged.
