You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

- Program:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
index = 0
t = int(data[index])
index += 1
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    b = data[index]
    index += 1
    results.append(func_1(b))
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(encoded):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    char_map = {}
    len_unique = len(unique_chars)
    for i in range(len_unique):
        char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]
    decoded = ''.join((char_map[ch] for ch in encoded))
    return decoded



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a string `encoded` and returns a new string `decoded`. It creates a mapping between each unique character in `encoded` and its corresponding character based on a mirrored sorted order of unique characters. If the number of unique characters is odd, the middle character maps to itself. The function then uses this mapping to replace each character in the original `encoded` string to produce the `decoded` string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly decodes the encoded string according to the problem description. Here's a breakdown of how the program works and why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads multiple test cases from standard input. It correctly handles the reading of the number of test cases (`t`), the length of the encoded string (`n`), and the encoded string itself (`b`).

2. **Decoding Logic**:
   - **Unique Characters**: The program constructs a set of unique characters from the encoded string and sorts them alphabetically to form the auxiliary string `r`.
   - **Character Mapping**: It creates a dictionary `char_map` that maps each character in `r` to its corresponding symmetric character in `r`.
   - **Decoding**: For each character in the encoded string `b`, it uses the `char_map` to find the corresponding character in the original string `s`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Character Strings**: The program correctly handles single-character strings. For example, the input `"w"` is correctly decoded to `"w"`.
   - **Multiple Test Cases**: The program processes multiple test cases correctly, ensuring that each encoded string is decoded independently.
   - **Symmetry Handling**: The program correctly handles the symmetry of the mapping, ensuring that each character is mapped to its correct symmetric counterpart.

Given the provided examples and the structure of the program, it appears that the program correctly decodes the encoded strings for all potential cases described in the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
