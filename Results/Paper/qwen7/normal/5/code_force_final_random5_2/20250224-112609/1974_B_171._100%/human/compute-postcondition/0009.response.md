Output State: **`len_unique` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `char_map[unique_chars[3]]` is equal to `unique_chars[2]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `char_map[unique_chars[i]]` to `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]`. Given the initial conditions:
- `i` is 3
- `char_map[unique_chars[1]]` is equal to `unique_chars[len_unique - 2]`

We substitute these into the code:
- `char_map[unique_chars[3]]` is set to `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - 3]`, which simplifies to `unique_chars[len_unique - 4]`.

Since `len_unique` must be greater than 3, the condition `len_unique - 4` would refer to the index `len_unique - 4` in `unique_chars`. Therefore, `char_map[unique_chars[3]]` is now equal to `unique_chars[len_unique - 4]`, which is the same as `unique_chars[len_unique - 2]` according to the initial condition. Thus, the updated state is as stated above.
