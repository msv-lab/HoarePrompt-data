Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in this case is `i`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len_unique`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `len_unique` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `char_map[unique_chars[0]]` is equal to `unique_chars[len_unique - 1]`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop continues as long as `i < len_unique`, the next value of `i` will be 1.
   - The condition `char_map[unique_chars[0]] == unique_chars[len_unique - 1]` remains unchanged because it is not dependent on `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `len_unique` must still be greater than 0.
- `i` will be 1.
- `char_map[unique_chars[0]]` is still equal to `unique_chars[len_unique - 1]`.

So, the updated state is:
State: **`len_unique` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `char_map[unique_chars[0]]` is equal to `unique_chars[len_unique - 1]`**
