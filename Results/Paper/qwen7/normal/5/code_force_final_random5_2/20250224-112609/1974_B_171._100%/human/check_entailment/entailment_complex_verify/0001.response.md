### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads input from standard input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It correctly initializes the index to 0 and reads the number of test cases `t`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the encoded string `b`.
   - It then processes the encoded string `b` to decode it using the function `func_1`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes an encoded string `b` as input.
   - It first finds all unique characters in `b` and sorts them alphabetically to form the string `unique_chars`.
   - It creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to its corresponding symmetric character.
   - Finally, it decodes the string `b` by replacing each character with its mapped value from `char_map`.

4. **Decoding Logic:**
   - The logic to create the `char_map` is correct. It maps each character to its symmetric counterpart in the sorted list of unique characters.
   - The decoding process using the `char_map` also appears to be correct.

5. **Output:**
   - The decoded strings are stored in the `results` list and printed out one by one.

Given the above analysis, the provided program seems to follow the correct steps to decode the encoded strings as per the problem description.

However, there is a subtle issue with the way the `char_map` is created and used. Specifically, when creating the `char_map`, the function should map each character to its symmetric counterpart, but the current implementation does not handle the case where the number of unique characters is odd correctly. When the number of unique characters is odd, the middle character should map to itself, but the current implementation does not account for this.

### Example to Illustrate the Issue:
Consider the encoded string `b = "abacaba"`. The unique characters are `a, b`, and the sorted order is `a, b`. The symmetric mapping should be:
- `a -> b`
- `b -> a`

But the current implementation would create:
- `a -> b`
- `b -> a`

This is correct, but let's consider another example where the number of unique characters is odd, say `b = "abcba"`. The unique characters are `a, b, c`, and the sorted order is `a, b, c`. The symmetric mapping should be:
- `a -> c`
- `b -> b`
- `c -> a`

But the current implementation would create:
- `a -> c`
- `b -> a`
- `c -> b`

This is incorrect because `b` should map to itself.

### Corrected Implementation:
To fix this, we need to ensure that the middle character (if any) is correctly mapped to itself. Here is the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(encoded):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    char_map = {}
    len_unique = len(unique_chars)
    for i in range(len_unique // 2):
        char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]
        char_map[unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]] = unique_chars[i]
    if len_unique % 2 == 1:
        char_map[unique_chars[len_unique // 2]] = unique_chars[len_unique // 2]
    decoded = ''.join(char_map[ch] for ch in encoded)
    return decoded
```

With this correction, the program should work correctly for all cases.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was almost correct, but it did not account for the special case where the number of unique characters is odd. With the corrected implementation, the program should now handle all cases correctly.

### Final:
Final: **False**
