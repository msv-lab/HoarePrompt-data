Output State: `len_unique` is less than or equal to `i`, every key in `char_map` is paired with its corresponding character such that `char_map[unique_chars[j]]` equals `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - j]` for all valid `j`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `char_map` will contain mappings for each unique character in `encoded`, where each character is mapped to its mirror character in the sorted list of unique characters. If `len_unique` is odd, the middle character will be its own mapping. If `len_unique` is even, all characters will be paired symmetrically.
