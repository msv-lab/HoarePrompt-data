Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` and `len_unique`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len_unique`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `len_unique` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `char_map[unique_chars[1]]` is equal to `unique_chars[len_unique - 2]`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - The value of `len_unique` does not change based on the given information, so it remains the same.

5. **Check the loop condition**: For the loop to execute again, `i` (which will be 3) must still be less than `len_unique`. This means `len_unique` must be greater than 3.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `len_unique` must be greater than 3.
   - The value of `char_map[unique_chars[1]]` and `unique_chars[len_unique - 2]` does not change and remains as they were in the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`len_unique` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `char_map[unique_chars[1]]` is equal to `unique_chars[len_unique - 2]`**
