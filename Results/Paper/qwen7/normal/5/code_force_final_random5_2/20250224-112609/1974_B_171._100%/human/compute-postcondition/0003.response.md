Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len_unique`.
3. **Initial state of the variables**:
   - `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars`.
   - `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters from `encoded`, sorted alphabetically.
   - `char_map` is an empty dictionary.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars`, it should be a positive integer (greater than 0) for the loop to execute at least once.
   - The variable `i` should start at 0 for the loop to begin its first iteration.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `len_unique` is greater than 0 and `i` is set to 0.

**Final State**:
State: **`len_unique` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
