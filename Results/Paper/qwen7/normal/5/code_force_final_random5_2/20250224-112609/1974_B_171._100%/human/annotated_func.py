#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The string encoded is the result of encoding some original string s using the specified algorithm.
def func_1(encoded):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    char_map = {}
    len_unique = len(unique_chars)
    for i in range(len_unique):
        char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]
        
    #State: Output State: `len_unique` is less than or equal to `i`, every key in `char_map` is paired with its corresponding character such that `char_map[unique_chars[j]]` equals `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - j]` for all valid `j`.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop, `char_map` will contain mappings for each unique character in `encoded`, where each character is mapped to its mirror character in the sorted list of unique characters. If `len_unique` is odd, the middle character will be its own mapping. If `len_unique` is even, all characters will be paired symmetrically.
    decoded = ''.join(char_map[ch] for ch in encoded)
    return decoded
    #The program returns the string `decoded`, which is the result of replacing each character in the original `encoded` string using the mappings defined in `char_map`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `encoded` and returns a new string `decoded`. It creates a mapping between each unique character in `encoded` and its corresponding character based on a mirrored sorted order of unique characters. If the number of unique characters is odd, the middle character maps to itself. The function then uses this mapping to replace each character in the original `encoded` string to produce the `decoded` string.
