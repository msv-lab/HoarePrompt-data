Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters from `encoded`, sorted alphabetically.**

Explanation: The code `unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))` creates a set from the string `encoded` to remove duplicate characters and then sorts the resulting set of unique characters alphabetically. The length of `encoded` and its nature (consisting of lowercase Latin letters) remain unchanged. The new variable `unique_chars` is a list of these unique, sorted characters.
