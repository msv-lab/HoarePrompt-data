Output State: **`re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `i` is 2 * `n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `res` contains the elements from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, `ur` is increased by `2 * n` for each iteration where `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, and `r` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes `re`, `ul`, and `ur` to 0. The values of `i`, `a`, `res`, and `r` remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, these variables retain their previous values and conditions.
