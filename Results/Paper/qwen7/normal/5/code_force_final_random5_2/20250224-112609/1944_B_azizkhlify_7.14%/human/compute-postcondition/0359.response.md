Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `res` must contain elements, `ul` is equal to `ur` + 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The variable `ur` is incremented by 2, making its new value `ur + 2`. All other variables (`i`, `res`, `ul`) remain unchanged from their initial states. We also break out of the most internal loop or if statement as mentioned in the initial state.
