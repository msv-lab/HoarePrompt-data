Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` remains the same (though its value is not specified, it doesn't affect the current output).
   - The element at index `a[i] - 1` in list `l` is equal to 1.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(a[i], end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - `a[i]` refers to the element at index `i` in the list `a`. Given that `i` is 0, `a[i]` is `a[0]`.
   - The value of `a[0] - 1` is the index from which we are retrieving the element in list `l`. Since the element at this index in `l` is 1, we don't need to know the exact value of `a[0]` to determine the output.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The `print(a[i], end=' ')` statement will print the value of `a[0]`.

Given that the value of `a[0] - 1` corresponds to an index in `l` where the element is 1, and since `a[0] - 1` must be a valid index, the value of `a[0]` must be 1 (because `1 - 1 = 0`, and the element at index 0 in `l` is 1).

Therefore, the output will be the value of `a[0]`, which is 1.

Output: **1**
