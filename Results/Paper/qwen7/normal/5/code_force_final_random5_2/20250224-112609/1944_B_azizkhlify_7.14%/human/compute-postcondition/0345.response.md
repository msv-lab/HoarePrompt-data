Output State: **The loop will continue to execute as long as `res` contains elements. Since the problem does not specify a termination condition and given that `res` must contain at least one element for each iteration, the loop will keep running indefinitely unless `res` is explicitly emptied or modified within the loop.**

In simpler terms, the loop will keep printing elements from `res` one by one until `res` is empty. However, based on the given information, there's no indication that `res` will ever become empty, so the loop will theoretically run forever, printing elements from `res` continuously.
