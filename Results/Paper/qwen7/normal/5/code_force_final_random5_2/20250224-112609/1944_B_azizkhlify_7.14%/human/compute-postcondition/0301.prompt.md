Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is greater than `2 * n - 1`, `k` is an input integer, `ul` is 0, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `l` is a list of `n` zeros where each element at index `a[i] - 1` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1` has been incremented by 1, `r` is a list of `n` zeros with all elements being `n`, `re` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        ul += 2
    if ul == k * 2:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is less than `n`, `n` is at least 1, and `ul` is equal to `k * 2` if the condition `ul == k * 2` is met. If the condition is not met, there is no change in the program state.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is increased by 1 from its previous value (`i_new`), `n` remains the same, and `ul` remains the same.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `i_new + 1`, `n` remains the same, and `ul` remains the same.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
