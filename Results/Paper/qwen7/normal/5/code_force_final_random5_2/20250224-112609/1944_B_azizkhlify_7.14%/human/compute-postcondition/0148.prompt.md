Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `i` is within the range `[n, n-1]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `res` is an empty list, `l` is a list of length `n` with each element initially set to 0, `l[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for each iteration where `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n` (since it starts from `2 * n` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n`). The variables `re`, `ul`, and `ur` remain unchanged at 0. The list `l` will have been updated such that for each index `j` (where `j` is `a[i] - 1`), the value of `l[j]` will be incremented by 1 for every occurrence of `r[j]` being 2 during the loop's iterations. The list `a` and the list `res` remain as they were initialized, with `a` containing the original list of integers and `res` remaining empty.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    r[a[i] - 1] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1, `i` is `i_prev + 1`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1, `i` is `i_prev + 2`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
