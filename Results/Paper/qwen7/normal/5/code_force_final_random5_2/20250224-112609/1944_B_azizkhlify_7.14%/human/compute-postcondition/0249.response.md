Output State: **The loop will continue to increment `i` until it reaches `2 * n`. For each iteration, if `r[a[i] - 1]` equals 2, it prints `a[i]` twice and increments `ur` by 2. If `ul` (which is initially equal to `ur`) becomes equal to `ur`, the loop breaks. After all iterations, `i` will be `2 * n`, `n` will be less than or equal to the length of `res`, and `ul` will be equal to `ur` plus twice the number of times the condition `r[a[i] - 1] == 2` was true.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `i` will be set to `2 * n`, `n` will still be less than or equal to the length of `res`, and `ul` will be equal to `ur` plus twice the number of times the condition `r[a[i] - 1] == 2` was met during the loop's execution.
