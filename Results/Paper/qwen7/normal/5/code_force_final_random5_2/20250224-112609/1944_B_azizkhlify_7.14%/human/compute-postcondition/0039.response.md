Output State: **`res` is an empty list, `re` is 0, `ul` is 4, `ur` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no specific loop or conditional block is mentioned in the initial state or the code snippet, we assume it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. All other variables retain their original values.
