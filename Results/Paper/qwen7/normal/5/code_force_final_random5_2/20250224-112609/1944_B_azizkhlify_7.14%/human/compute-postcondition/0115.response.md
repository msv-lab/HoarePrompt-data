To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement:

1. **Print Statement**: `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')`
   - This statement prints two occurrences of `a[i]` followed by a space (`end=' '`).

2. **Initial State**:
   - There is no explicit mention of the value of `a` or `i` in the initial state. Therefore, we need to consider the general form of the print statement.

Given the print statement, it will print the value of `a[i]` twice, separated by a space. Since the exact values of `a` and `i` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **a[i] a[i]**
