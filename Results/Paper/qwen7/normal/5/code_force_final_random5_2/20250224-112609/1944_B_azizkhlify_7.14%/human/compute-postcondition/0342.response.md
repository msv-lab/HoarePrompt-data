Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in res:`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `res`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `res` must contain at least one element. This is because the loop iterates over each element in `res`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `res` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is iterating over elements in `res`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be set to the next element in `res`.
   - However, the condition for the loop to continue (`res` containing at least one element) remains the same.

5. **Formulate the New State:**
   - The state of `i` will change to the next element in `res`, but the condition that `res` must contain at least one element still holds true.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`res` must contain at least one element, `i` is the next element in `res`**
