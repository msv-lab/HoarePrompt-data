Output State: **`r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, and `ur` is 2 more than its original value and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or if statement we were inside. The values of `r[a[i] - 1]` and `ur` remain unchanged from their initial states, but the program now exits the loop or if statement.
