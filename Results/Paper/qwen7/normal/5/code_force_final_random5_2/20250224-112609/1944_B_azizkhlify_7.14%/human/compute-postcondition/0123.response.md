Output State: The loop will continue to execute until `ul` equals `ur`. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `2 * n`, `ur` will be incremented by 2 for each iteration where `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, and the loop will break once `ul` equals `ur`. Since the loop runs from `i = n` to `i = 2 * n - 1`, it will execute exactly `n` times. Therefore, `ur` will be incremented by `2 * n`. The final state will have `i` as `2 * n`, `ur` as its original value plus `2 * n`, and the loop will be broken out of when `ul` equals `ur`.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `i` will be `2 * n`, `ur` will be increased by 2 for each iteration where `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2 (totaling `2 * n` increases), and the loop will stop when `ul` equals `ur`.
