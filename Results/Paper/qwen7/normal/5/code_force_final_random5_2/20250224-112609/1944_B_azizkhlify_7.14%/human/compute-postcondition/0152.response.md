Output State: **`re` is 0, `ul` is 2, `ur` is 0, `i` is `2 * n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `res` is an empty list, `l` is a list of length `n` where each element is incremented by 1 for every occurrence of `r[j]` being 2 during the loop's iterations for `i` in the range `[n, n-1]`. The value of `l[a[i] - 1]` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `ul += 2` increments the value of `ul` by 2. Since `ul` was initially 0, after executing this line, `ul` becomes 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
