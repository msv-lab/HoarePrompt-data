Output State: **`res` is an empty list, `re` is 0, `ul` is 2 * `k`, `ur` is 0, `i` is `n`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `res`, `re`, `ul`, `ur`, or `i`. It only indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such loop or conditional block is specified in the given code snippet, the values of these variables remain unchanged.
