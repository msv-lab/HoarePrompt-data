Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Description:**
   - `re` is set to `k + 1`.
   - `i` is the second element of `res`.
   - `res` contains elements from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1 until `re` reaches `k + 1`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `re`: This is explicitly stated to be `k + 1`.
   - `i`: This is the second element of `res`.
   - `res`: This is a list that contains elements from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, and it stops when `re` (which is `k + 1`) is reached.

3. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print(i, end=' ')`. This will print the value of `i` followed by a space.

4. **Determine the Value of `i`:**
   - Since `i` is the second element of `res`, we need to know what `res` looks like. However, the exact content of `res` is not provided directly. We know that `res` contains elements from `a` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, but without knowing `a` and `l`, we cannot determine the exact value of `i`.

Given the information provided, we can only say that `i` is the second element of `res`, but we do not have enough details to determine its exact value.

Therefore, the output will be the second element of `res`, followed by a space.

Output: **[second element of res] **
