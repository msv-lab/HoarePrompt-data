Output State: **`re` is 0, `ul` is 2 * `k`, `ur` is 0, `i` is `2 * n`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `res` is an empty list, `l` is a list of length `n` where each element is incremented by 1 for every occurrence of `r[j]` being 2 during the loop's iterations for `i` in the range `[n, n-1]`. We break out of the loop.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the loop prematurely. Since the loop was not executed due to the `break` statement, the values of the variables `re`, `ul`, `ur`, `i`, `a`, `res`, and `l` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the loop.
