Output State: The loop will continue to execute as long as `res` contains elements. After all iterations of the loop, `res` will be empty, and the loop will terminate. All elements that satisfied the condition (based on the current logic provided) will have been printed, one per line, using `print(i, end=' ')`. The output will consist of all elements from `res` that met the condition during the loop's execution.

In natural language: After all iterations of the loop, the list `res` will be empty because all elements that met the condition have been processed and printed. The output will be a sequence of elements from `res` that satisfied the condition, each on a new line.
