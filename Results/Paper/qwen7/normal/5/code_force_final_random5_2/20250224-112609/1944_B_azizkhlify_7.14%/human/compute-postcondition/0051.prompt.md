Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `res` is an empty list, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `i` is `2 * n`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` from `n` to `2 * n - 1`.

In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have completed, the variable `i` will be equal to `2 * n`. Each element in the list `r` corresponding to the indices `a[i] - 1` for `i` ranging from `n` to `2 * n - 1` will have been incremented by 1. All other variables (`res`, `re`, `ul`, `ur`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        ul += 2
    if ul == k * 2:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `res` is an empty list, `re` is 0, `ul` is 2 * `k`, `ur` is 0, `i` is `n`, and either we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `res` is an empty list, `re` is 0, `ul` is 4, `ur` is 0, and `i` is `n + 1`. If `ul` equals `k * 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the variables remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `res` is an empty list, `re` is 0, `ul` is 4, `ur` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 1, and if `ul` equals `k * 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
