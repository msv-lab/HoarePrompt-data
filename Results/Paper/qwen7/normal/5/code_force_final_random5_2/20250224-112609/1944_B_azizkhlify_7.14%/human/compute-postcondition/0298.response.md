Output State: **`i` is `i_new + 1`, `n` remains the same, `ul` remains the same.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or match a case in a switch statement. In this context, it means that the loop or case block has been exited, but no variables are modified by this statement. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, and `ul` remain unchanged from their previous states.
