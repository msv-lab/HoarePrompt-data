Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be less than or equal to the length of `res`, `ul` is equal to `ur` + 4, and the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or match a case in a switch statement. In this context, it means that the loop or case that `i` was iterating through has been exited. However, the `break` statement does not change the values of any variables outside of the loop or case. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `ul`, `ur`, and `r[a[i] - 1]` remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
