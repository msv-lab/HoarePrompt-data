You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program:
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a test case consisting of two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \) (where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 100 \)) and prints either 'Yes' or 'No' based on whether \( n \) is greater than or equal to \( m \). After executing, the function does not return any value but outputs 'Yes' or 'No' to indicate the relationship between \( n \) and \( m \).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `kreker` using `int(input())`.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a for loop that runs `kreker` times.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - A function `func_1()` is defined but not implemented. This is incorrect because the function is called inside the loop without any implementation.

3. **Reading Test Cases**:
   - Inside the loop, the program attempts to read two integers `n` and `m` for each test case using `map(int, input().split())`.

4. **Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. If true, it prints 'Yes', otherwise, it prints 'No'.

Now, let's consider the actual logic required to solve the problem:
- To determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, we need to check if `n` (total moves) can be split into additions and subtractions such that the net result is `m` cubes.
- Since each move either adds 1 cube or removes 1 cube, the parity (odd/even nature) of `n` and `m` must match. Specifically, `n - m` must be even because each addition and removal cancels out in pairs.

Given this, the current program is incorrect because:
- It does not account for the parity check.
- The function `func_1()` is not defined and should be implemented to perform the necessary logic.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

With this correction, the program will correctly determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

**Final Answer:**
Correctness: **False**
