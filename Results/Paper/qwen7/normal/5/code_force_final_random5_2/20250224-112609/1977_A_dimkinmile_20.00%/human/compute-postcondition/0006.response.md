Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a test case consisting of two positive integers n and m where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. It does not return any value directly but implies that it might perform some operations or calculations based on these integers.**

However, since the problem statement does not specify what operations or calculations the function performs, the description focuses on the parameters and their constraints.
