The function processes a test case consisting of two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \) (where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 100 \)) and prints either 'Yes' or 'No' based on whether \( n \) is greater than or equal to \( m \). After executing, the function does not return any value but outputs 'Yes' or 'No' to indicate the relationship between \( n \) and \( m \).
