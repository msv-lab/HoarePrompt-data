Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer equal to the first element of `data` converted to an integer.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[4]`.
- `s` is a string of length `data[3]` consisting only of "U" and "D".
- `index` is 4.
- `count_u` is the number of 'U' in the string `s`, and it is specified that this count is odd.

The print statement is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement directly prints the string 'YES'. The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `index`, and `count_u` are not relevant to the print statement itself, as it is printing a fixed string regardless of the values of these variables.

Output: **YES**
