Reasoning:
- The provided program reads multiple test cases from standard input and processes each one according to the problem statement.
- The function `func_1()` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case.
- For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the orientation of the coins.
- It then counts the number of 'U' characters in the string `s`.
- Based on whether this count is odd or even, it prints 'YES' or 'NO', respectively.
- The logic for determining the winner is correct according to the problem statement: if the count of 'U' characters is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.
- The state information provided in the comments aligns with the expected behavior of the program.
- There are no logical errors or omissions in the code that would cause it to produce incorrect results based on the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
