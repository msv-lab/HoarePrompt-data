Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read`, which is an efficient way to handle multiple test cases.
   - It splits the input into a list of strings and processes it.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it extracts the number of coins (`n`) and the string `s` representing the initial state of the coins.
   - It counts the number of 'U' characters in the string `s`.

3. **Determining the Winner:**
   - The key logic is in the condition `if count_u % 2 == 1:`.
   - This condition checks if the number of facing-up coins (`count_u`) is odd.
   - If `count_u` is odd, the program prints 'YES', indicating Alice wins.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO', indicating Bob wins.

4. **Optimality Consideration:**
   - The problem states that the game ends in a finite number of operations and one of them will win.
   - The given logic correctly identifies whether Alice or Bob will win based on the initial configuration of the coins.
   - The logic is based on the observation that if the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always force a win by making optimal moves.

### Verification with Examples:
- **Example 1:** `5 UUDUD`
  - Initial state: `UUDUD`
  - Count of 'U': 3 (odd)
  - Output: `YES` (Correct)

- **Example 2:** `5 UDDUD`
  - Initial state: `UDDUD`
  - Count of 'U': 2 (even)
  - Output: `NO` (Correct)

- **Example 3:** `2 UU`
  - Initial state: `UU`
  - Count of 'U': 2 (even)
  - Output: `NO` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the initial configuration of the coins. It handles all the test cases provided in the problem statement accurately.

**Correctness: True**
