You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and s is a string of length n consisting only of "U" and "D".
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        s = data[index + 1]
        
        index += 2
        
        count_u = s.count('U')
        
        if count_u % 2 == 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer equal to the first element of `data` converted to an integer minus the total number of iterations executed, `n` is the integer value of `data[3*iterations - 1]`, `s` is now the string `data[3*iterations]`, `index` is `3*iterations + 1`, `count_u` is the number of 'U' in the string `s`. After all iterations, `count_u` is the cumulative count of 'U' in all the strings processed during the loop.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be the initial value minus the number of times the loop ran. `n` will be the integer value of the element at the position calculated as `3 * (number of iterations - 1) + 1` in the `data` list. `s` will be the last string processed, which is located at the position `3 * (number of iterations)`. `index` will be `3 * (number of iterations) + 1`. Finally, `count_u` will be the total count of 'U' characters across all the strings processed during the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes variables t, n, and s, where t is a positive integer between 1 and 100, inclusive; n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, inclusive; and s is a string of length n consisting only of "U" and "D". For each test case defined by t, the function returns a specific output based on the string s.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
