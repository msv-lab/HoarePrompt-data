Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to the first element of `data` converted to an integer, `n` is the integer value of `data[4]`, `s` is a string of length `data[3]` consisting only of "U" and "D", `index` is 4.**

Explanation: The code `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. Given that `index` was initially 2, after executing the code, `index` becomes 4. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
