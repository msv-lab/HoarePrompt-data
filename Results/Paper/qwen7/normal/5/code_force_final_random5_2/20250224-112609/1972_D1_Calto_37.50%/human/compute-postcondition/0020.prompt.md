You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6 and the sum of all m and n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^6.
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, m):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        
        y = i * i
        
        cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `m` must be greater than 1; `i` is equal to `m`; `x` is `n - (m * m - m)`, `y` is `m * m`; `cnt` is the sum of `x // y + (m > 1)` added for each iteration from `i` starting from 1 up to `m-1`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `m` will be the final value it was set to, `i` will be equal to `m`, `x` will be calculated as `n - (m * m - m)`, `y` will be `m * m`, and `cnt` will be the cumulative sum of `x // y + 1` for each `i` from 1 to `m-1`.
    if (cnt == 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: `m` is greater than 1, `i` is equal to `m`, `x` is `n - (m * m - m)`, `y` is `m * m`, and `cnt` is the sum of `x // y + 1` for each `i` from 1 to `m-1`
    return cnt
    #The program returns the sum of x // y + 1 for each i from 1 to m-1, where x is n - (m * m - m), y is m * m, and n is equal to m.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, n and m, both positive integers with 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6. It returns 1 in the first case and the sum of x // y + 1 for each i from 1 to m-1, where x is n - (m * m - m) and y is m * m, in the second case.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 1

Case_2: The program returns the sum of x // y + 1 for each i from 1 to m-1, where x is n - (m * m - m), y is m * m, and n is equal to m.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
