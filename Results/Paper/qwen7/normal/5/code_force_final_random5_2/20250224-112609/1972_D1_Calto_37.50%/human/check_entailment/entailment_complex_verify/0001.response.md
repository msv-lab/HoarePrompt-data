### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identified that the function `func_2` in the provided program is incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the function and the overall program to confirm this conclusion.

#### Function `func_1`
- **Correctness**: The function `func_1` correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `a` and `b`. This part of the program is correct.

#### Function `func_2`
- **Original Implementation**:
  ```python
  def func_2(n, m):
      cnt = 0
      for i in range(1, m):
          x = n - (i * i - i)
          y = i * i
          cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
      if cnt == 0:
          return 1
      return cnt
  ```
  - **Issues**:
    - The variables `x` and `y` do not have any direct relation to the problem constraints.
    - The loop iterates over values of `i` from 1 to `m-1`, but these values do not correspond to valid values of `b` in the context of the problem.
    - The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not checked properly.

- **Correct Implementation**:
  The correct approach should involve iterating over all possible values of `a` and `b` and checking the condition directly:
  ```python
  def func_2(n, m):
      cnt = 0
      for a in range(1, n + 1):
          for b in range(1, m + 1):
              if (a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0:
                  cnt += 1
      return cnt
  ```

### Conclusion

The original function `func_2` does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem. The provided solution in the original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues and suggesting a correct approach.

**Final: False**

The given program is incorrect because the function `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem.
