Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b`. The logic is sound and the output is correct based on the provided state annotations.
2. **Function `func_2`**: The provided implementation of `func_2` does not correctly solve the problem. The logic inside the function does not align with the problem statement. Specifically:
   - The formula used to calculate `x` and `y` does not relate to the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The loop iterates from 1 to `m-1`, but it does not account for all possible pairs `(a, b)` within the given constraints.
   - The calculation of `cnt` does not correctly count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)`.

Given these issues, the function `func_2` does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
