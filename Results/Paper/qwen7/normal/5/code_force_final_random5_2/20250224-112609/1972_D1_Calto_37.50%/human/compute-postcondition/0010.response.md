Output State: **`m` must be greater than 1; `i` is `m`; `x` is `n - (m * m - m)`; `y` is `m * m`; `cnt` is the same as the previous value; `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` to `n - (i * i - i)`. Given that `i` is equal to `m`, `x` becomes `n - (m * m - m)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
