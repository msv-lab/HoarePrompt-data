Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^6, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^6.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `cnt` to 0. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state, as no operations are performed on them. Therefore, `n` and `m` are still positive integers within the specified range, and `cnt` is explicitly set to 0.
