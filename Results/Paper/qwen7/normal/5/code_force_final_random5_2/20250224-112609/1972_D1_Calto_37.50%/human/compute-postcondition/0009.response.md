Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop runs from `1` to `m-1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `m`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `m` must be greater than 1.
   - `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`.
   - `y` is `i * i`.
   - `cnt` is `cnt + (n - ((i + 1) * (i + 1) - (i + 1))) // ((i + 1) * (i + 1)) + ((i + 1) > 1) + x // y + (i > 1)`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `m-1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `m`. Therefore, `i` should be incremented to `m`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `m` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `m`.
   - `x` and `y` depend on `i`, so they will change based on the new value of `i`.
   - `cnt` is updated based on the previous value of `i`, so it does not change directly but its value will be used in the next iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`m` must be greater than 1; `i` is `m`; `x` is `n - (m * m - m)`, `y` is `m * m`; `cnt` is the same as the previous value**.
