You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Annotated Code: 
import math

t = int(input())

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\).
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State: Output State: The values of `a` and `b` will be such that `b` is 0 and `a` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`.
    #
    #Explanation: The given loop implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `a` and `b`. After the loop completes all its iterations, `a` will hold the GCD of the initial values of `a` and `b`, and `b` will be 0 because the algorithm continues until `b` becomes 0.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`, with `b` being 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`. It computes their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm, updating the values of `a` and `b` within the process. Upon completion, the function returns the GCD of the initial values of `a` and `b`, with `b` being 0.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6 and the sum of all m and n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^6.
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, m):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        
        y = i * i
        
        cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `m` must be greater than 1; `i` is equal to `m`; `x` is `n - (m * m - m)`, `y` is `m * m`; `cnt` is the sum of `x // y + (m > 1)` added for each iteration from `i` starting from 1 up to `m-1`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `m` will be the final value it was set to, `i` will be equal to `m`, `x` will be calculated as `n - (m * m - m)`, `y` will be `m * m`, and `cnt` will be the cumulative sum of `x // y + 1` for each `i` from 1 to `m-1`.
    if (cnt == 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: `m` is greater than 1, `i` is equal to `m`, `x` is `n - (m * m - m)`, `y` is `m * m`, and `cnt` is the sum of `x // y + 1` for each `i` from 1 to `m-1`
    return cnt
    #The program returns the sum of x // y + 1 for each i from 1 to m-1, where x is n - (m * m - m), y is m * m, and n is equal to m.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, both positive integers with 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6. It calculates the sum of `x // y + 1` for each `i` from 1 to `m-1`, where `x` is `n - (m * m - m)` and `y` is `m * m`. If this sum equals 0, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns the calculated sum.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The implementation is correct and efficient.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function is intended to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\) with the condition that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - Let's break down the logic inside `func_2`:
     ```python
     def func_2(n, m):
         cnt = 0
         for i in range(1, m):
             x = n - (i * i - i)
             y = i * i
             cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
         if cnt == 0:
             return 1
         return cnt
     ```

     - The loop iterates over values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m-1\).
     - For each \(b\), it computes \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\).
     - It then increments the count `cnt` by `x // y + (i > 1)`.
     - Finally, it returns `cnt`.

### Issues in the Function `func_2`

- **Incorrect Calculation**: The calculation of `x` and `y` does not align with the problem statement. Specifically, \(x\) and \(y\) do not represent any meaningful values related to the problem constraints.
- **Logic Mismatch**: The logic inside the loop does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt
```

### Conclusion

The given function `func_2` is incorrect because it does not follow the problem's requirements. Therefore, the provided program is not correct.

**Correctness: **False**
