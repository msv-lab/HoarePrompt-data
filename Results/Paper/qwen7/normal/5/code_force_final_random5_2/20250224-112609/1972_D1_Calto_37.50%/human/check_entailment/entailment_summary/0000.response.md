Reasoning:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Let's break down why:

1. **Problem Description**: We need to count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. However, this function is not used in the main logic of the program.

3. **Function `func_2`**: The implementation in `func_2` does not match the problem requirements. Specifically:
   - The formula `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` do not relate to the problem constraints.
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `m-1`, which is not aligned with the requirement to consider all possible pairs (a, b).
   - The logic inside the loop does not check whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Given these observations, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
