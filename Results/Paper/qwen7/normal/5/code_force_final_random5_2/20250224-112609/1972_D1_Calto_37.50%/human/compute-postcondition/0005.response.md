Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `m` must be greater than 1
- `x` is `n - (i * i - i)`
- `y` is `i * i`
- `cnt` is `cnt + (n - (i * i - i)) // (i * i) + (i > 1)`

### Loop Head:
```
for i in range(1, m):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < m`.
- The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
- The loop will continue as long as `i < m`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Determine the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration:**
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, if the loop just finished an iteration where `i` was some value `k`, then the next iteration will start with `i = k + 1`.

2. **Check the condition for the next iteration:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < m`.
   - Therefore, for the next iteration to occur, `i + 1` must be less than `m`.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly:**
   - `m` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body.
   - `x` is recalculated based on the new value of `i`.
   - `y` is recalculated based on the new value of `i`.
   - `cnt` is updated based on the new value of `i`.

### New States at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `m` must still be greater than 1.
- `x` will be `n - ((i + 1) * (i + 1) - (i + 1))`.
- `y` will be `(i + 1) * (i + 1)`.
- `cnt` will be updated by adding `(n - ((i + 1) * (i + 1) - (i + 1))) // ((i + 1) * (i + 1)) + ((i + 1) > 1)` to the current value of `cnt`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`m` must be greater than 1; `x` is `n - ((i + 1) * (i + 1) - (i + 1))`; `y` is `(i + 1) * (i + 1)'; `cnt` is `cnt + (n - ((i + 1) * (i + 1) - (i + 1))) // ((i + 1) * (i + 1)) + ((i + 1) > 1)**
