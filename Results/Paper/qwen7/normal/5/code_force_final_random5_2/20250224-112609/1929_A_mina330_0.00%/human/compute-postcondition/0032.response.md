Output State: **`kq` is the sum of the differences calculated in all previous iterations, `itest` is `previous_itest + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user.**

The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The values of `kq`, `itest`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, `kq` remains the sum of the differences calculated in all previous iterations, `itest` remains `previous_itest + 1`, `n` remains an input integer, and `a` becomes a sorted list of integers entered by the user.
