Output State: **`i` is 2, `kq` is `a[len(a) - 2] - a[1] + a[len(a) - 2] - a[2]`**

Explanation: The initial value of `kq` is `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]`. The code updates `kq` by adding `a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, the expression `a[len(a) - i - 1]` becomes `a[len(a) - 2 - 1]` which simplifies to `a[len(a) - 3]`, but since array indices start from 0, it effectively refers to `a[len(a) - 2]` (considering the decrement by 1). Thus, the updated `kq` is `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0] + a[len(a) - 2] - a[2]`.
