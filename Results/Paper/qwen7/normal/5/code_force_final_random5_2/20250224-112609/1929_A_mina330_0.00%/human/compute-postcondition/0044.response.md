Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and a list of n integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) where each integer a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it returns information based on the values of t and the list of integers.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a specific number of integers within given constraints, and process these inputs to produce some form of output for each test case. However, since the exact nature of the output is not specified in the provided information, the focus here is on the structure and constraints of the input data.
