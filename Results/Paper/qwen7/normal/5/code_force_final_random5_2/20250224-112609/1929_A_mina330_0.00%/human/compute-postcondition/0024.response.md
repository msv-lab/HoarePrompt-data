Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(a) // 2`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `0` to `len(a) // 2 - 1` with a step of `1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(a) // 2`.

4. **Adjust the state of `i`**: Since `i` is incremented by `1` in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `len(a) // 2 + 1`.

5. **Keep other states unchanged**: The state of `kq` does not change within the loop head, so it remains as calculated in the previous iteration.

Based on these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`kq` is `a[0] - a[len(a) // 2] + a[len(a) - len(a) // 2 - 1] - a[len(a) // 2 - 1]`, `i` is `len(a) // 2 + 1`**
