Output State: **`kq` is the sum of the differences calculated in all previous iterations, `itest` is `previous_itest + 1`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value entered by the user (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The values of `kq` and `itest` remain unchanged from their initial states.
