Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is the first integer from the input string `s`.
- `b` is the second integer from the input string `s`.
- `t` must be at least 1.
- The sum of `a` and `b` is even.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Bob'`. Since no values for `a`, `b`, or `t` are needed to determine the output of this specific print statement, the output is solely determined by the string itself.

Output: **Bob**
