Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner based on the optimal strategy described in the problem statement. The program simply checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd and prints "Bob" or "Alice" accordingly. However, the actual winning condition depends on the parity of the individual counts of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, not just their sum.

According to the optimal strategy:
- If `a` is even and `b` is odd, Alice wins.
- If `a` is odd and `b` is even, Alice wins.
- Otherwise, Bob wins.

The provided implementation does not account for these specific conditions. Instead, it incorrectly assumes that the sum of `a` and `b` being even or odd determines the winner.

Given this analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
