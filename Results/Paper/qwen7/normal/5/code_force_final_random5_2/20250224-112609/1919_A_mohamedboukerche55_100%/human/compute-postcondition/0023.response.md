Output State: **`s` is the new input string, `a` is the first integer from the new input string `s`, `b` is the second integer from the new input string `s` converted to an integer, `t` must be at least 1, and `i` is `i + 2`.**

Explanation: The code `b = int(list(s.split())[1])` splits the string `s` into a list of substrings using whitespace as the delimiter, converts the list to integers, and assigns the second element (index 1) to `b`. The other variables (`s`, `a`, `t`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
