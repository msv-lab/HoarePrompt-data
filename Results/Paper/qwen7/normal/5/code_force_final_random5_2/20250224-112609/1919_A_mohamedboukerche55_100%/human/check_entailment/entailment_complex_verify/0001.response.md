### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Logic:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, taking turns to either swap wallets or remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move loses.
   - Both players play optimally.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The key observation here is that the parity (odd/even nature) of the sum of the coins in both wallets determines the winner.
   - If the sum of the coins in both wallets is even, Bob wins. If it is odd, Alice wins.

3. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` which contains the values of `a` and `b` separated by a space.
   - It splits the string `s` into a list and converts the first and second elements to integers, assigning them to `a` and `b`.
   - It checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd using `(a + b) % 2 == 0`.
   - If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob'. Otherwise, it prints 'Alice'.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic in the code correctly identifies the winner based on the parity of the sum of the coins.
   - However, there is a critical flaw in the implementation. The code does not handle the game dynamics correctly. Specifically, the game continues until a player cannot make a valid move, and the winner is determined based on whose turn it is when the game ends, not just the parity of the sum of the coins.

5. **Game Dynamics:**
   - The game involves alternating moves between Alice and Bob. The player who cannot make a move loses.
   - If the sum of the coins is even, Bob can always force Alice into a losing position by ensuring that the sum remains even after each of his moves.
   - Conversely, if the sum of the coins is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by ensuring that the sum remains odd after each of her moves.

6. **Correct Implementation:**
   - The correct approach would be to simulate the game or use a more complex logic to determine the winner based on the optimal moves of both players.
   - The current implementation only checks the parity of the sum and does not account for the game dynamics where players make optimal moves.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the winner based on the game dynamics. It only checks the parity of the sum of the coins, which is insufficient to determine the winner in the context of the game.

**Final: False**
