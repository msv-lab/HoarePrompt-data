Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is the first integer from the input string `s`.
- `b` is the second integer from the input string `s`.
- `t` must be at least 1.
- The sum of `a` and `b` is odd.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('Alice')
```

This statement will print the string "Alice" regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, and `t`, as long as the conditions about `a` and `b` hold true.

Output: **Alice**
