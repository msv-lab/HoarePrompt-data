Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `t`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < t`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `s` is the new input string.
   - `a` is the first integer from the new input string `s`.
   - `b` is the second integer from the new input string `s` converted to an integer.
   - `t` must be at least 1.
   - `i` is `i + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1 + 1 = i + 2`.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies it, but based on the given information, there is no indication that `t` is modified within the loop body.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

- `s` is the new input string (unchanged).
- `a` is the first integer from the new input string `s` (unchanged).
- `b` is the second integer from the new input string `s` converted to an integer (unchanged).
- `t` must be at least 1 (unchanged).
- `i` is `i + 2`.

**Final State**:
State: **`s` is the new input string, `a` is the first integer from the new input string `s`, `b` is the second integer from the new input string `s` converted to an integer, `t` must be at least 1, and `i` is `i + 2`**.
