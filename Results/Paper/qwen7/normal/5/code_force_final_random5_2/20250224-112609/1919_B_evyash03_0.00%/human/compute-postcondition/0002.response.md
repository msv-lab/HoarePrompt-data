State: **`count` is 0, `expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-", `balance` is 0, `char` must be the first character in the string `expression`** 

Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variable `char`, which iterates over each character in the string `expression`.
- For the loop to start executing, `char` must be set to the first character in the string `expression`.
- The other variables (`count` and `balance`) are initialized to 0 and do not affect the loop's ability to start, as they will be updated within the loop body.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted such that `char` is set to the first character in `expression`.
