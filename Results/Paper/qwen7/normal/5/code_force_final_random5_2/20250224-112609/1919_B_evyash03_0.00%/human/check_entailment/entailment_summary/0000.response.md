Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Penalty**: The provided program calculates the number of times the balance (sum of the array elements) resets to zero, which does not align with the problem statement. The goal is to minimize the total penalty, which is the sum of the absolute values of the sums of the subarrays multiplied by their lengths.

2. **Splitting Strategy**: The program does not actually split the array into subarrays to calculate the penalties. Instead, it simply counts how many times the balance resets to zero, which is not relevant to the penalty calculation.

3. **Output Mismatch**: The function `func_1` returns the count of resets plus one if the final balance is positive, but this does not correspond to the minimum possible penalty as required by the problem.

Given these points, the program does not implement the logic needed to compute the minimum possible penalty according to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
