Output State: **`count` is increased by 1, `balance` is an integer. If `char` is '+', `balance` is increased by 1. If `char` is '-', `balance` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `balance` remains unchanged.**

The code `count += 1` increments the value of `count` by 1. The value of `balance` remains unchanged according to the initial postcondition. Therefore, the updated state includes the incremented `count` and the unchanged `balance`.
