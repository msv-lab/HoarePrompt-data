Output State: **`count` is increased by 1, `balance` is 0**.

Explanation: The code sets `balance` to 0. This overrides the previous value of `balance` which was determined by the conditions involving `char`. The `count` variable, which was previously increased by 1, remains unchanged as no further operations on `count` are performed. Therefore, the updated state includes `count` being increased by 1 and `balance` being set to 0.
