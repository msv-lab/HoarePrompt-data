Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to minimize the penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s`. The penalty is calculated as the sum of the absolute values of the sums of the segments multiplied by their lengths.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to count the number of times the balance (sum of '+' and '-' characters) is reset to zero due to encountering a '-' character.
   - It also checks if the final balance is positive and adds one to the count if so.
   - However, this approach does not correctly calculate the penalty as described in the problem statement. The penalty involves the absolute value of the sum of each segment multiplied by its length, not just the number of splits.

3. **Penalty Calculation**:
   - The correct approach would be to split the string such that each segment has a non-negative sum, and then calculate the penalty for each segment.
   - The function `func_1` does not perform this calculation. Instead, it only counts the number of splits, which is not equivalent to the penalty calculation.

4. **Correct Solution**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to find the optimal way to split the string such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The provided code does not achieve this. The function `func_1` does not correctly compute the penalty based on the given rules.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly implement the penalty calculation as required by the problem statement.

Final: **False**
