Output State: **`count` is either 2 or 3, `expression` is a string consisting of characters "+", "-", `balance` is 0.**

Explanation: The code sets `balance` to 0, overriding its previous value which was determined by the last character of `expression`. The values of `count` and `expression` remain unchanged from their initial states.
