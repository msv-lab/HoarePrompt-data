Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summary step-by-step.

1. **Problem Description and Requirements**:
   - The goal is to minimize the penalty by splitting the array `a` into non-empty subarrays optimally.
   - The penalty of a subarray is calculated as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The program should handle the input string `s` and convert it into an array `a` where `a_i = 1` if `s_i = '+'` and `a_i = -1` if `s_i = '-'`.
   - The program should then find the optimal way to split `a` to minimize the total penalty.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `s` and the string `s` itself.
   - The string `s` is split based on the character `'-'`, which is not aligned with the problem's requirement of splitting the array `a` optimally.
   - The function `func_1` is called with the string `expression` and its length. This function does not actually perform the required splitting and calculation of penalties. Instead, it simply counts the number of times the balance (sum of elements in the array) is reset to 0 and adds 1 if the final balance is positive.

3. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a string `expression` and an integer `length`.
   - It iterates through the string `expression` and maintains a balance variable.
   - If the balance becomes negative, it increments a count and resets the balance to 0.
   - Finally, it adds 1 to the count if the final balance is greater than 0.
   - The function returns the total count.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic to find the optimal way to split the array `a` and calculate the minimum penalty.
   - The program does not correctly handle the problem requirements and instead uses a flawed approach to count something that is not relevant to the problem.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Final: **False**
