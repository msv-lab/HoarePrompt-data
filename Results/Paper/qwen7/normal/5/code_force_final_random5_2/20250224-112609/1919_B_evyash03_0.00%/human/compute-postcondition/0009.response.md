Output State: **`count` is 0, `expression` is a string consisting of characters "+", "-", `balance` is -1, `char` is '-'**

Explanation: The code `balance -= 1` decreases the value of `balance` by 1. Given that `balance` was initially 0, after executing this line, `balance` becomes -1. All other variables remain unchanged.
