Output State: **balance is balance - 1**

The value of `balance` is decreased by 1. The initial state of `balance` being a specific value is now updated to `balance - 1`. The precondition that `balance` was positive or had any other specific value remains valid, but its exact numerical value is now `balance - 1`.
