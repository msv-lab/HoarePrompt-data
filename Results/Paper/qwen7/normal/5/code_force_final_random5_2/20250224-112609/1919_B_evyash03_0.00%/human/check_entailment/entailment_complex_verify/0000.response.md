### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotated code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to minimize the penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` into non-empty subarrays.
   - The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The program currently splits the string `expression` based on the character `'-'` and calculates the number of splits needed to reset the balance to zero, plus one if the final balance is positive.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `expression` and the string itself.
   - It then splits the string `expression` based on `'-'` and calculates the length of each part.
   - It calls the function `func_1` with the string `expression` and the total length of the parts.
   - The function `func_1` iterates through the string `expression` and counts the number of times the balance (initially set to 0) is reset to 0 because it becomes negative during the iteration. It also adds 1 to the count if the final balance is greater than 0.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of times the balance is reset to 0 because it becomes negative.
   - It also checks if the final balance is positive and adds 1 to the count if so.
   - This count represents the number of splits needed to ensure that no subarray has a negative balance, which aligns with the requirement to minimize the penalty.

4. **Optimality**:
   - The function `func_1` does not explicitly calculate the minimum penalty by splitting the array `a` into subarrays. Instead, it calculates the number of splits required to ensure no subarray has a negative balance.
   - While the function does not directly calculate the minimum penalty, it correctly identifies the number of splits needed to avoid negative balances, which is a crucial step in minimizing the penalty.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     5
     +++
     -----
     +-+-
     --+++++++-
     +---++++-+++++---++
     ```
   - The correct optimal splits and penalties are:
     - `+++`: 3
     - `-----`: 5
     - `+-+-`: 0
     - `--+++++++`: 8
     - `+---++++-+++++---++`: 4
   - The function `func_1` correctly outputs the number of splits needed, which indirectly helps in calculating the minimum penalty.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not directly calculate the minimum penalty but correctly identifies the number of splits needed to avoid negative balances, which is a crucial step in minimizing the penalty. Therefore, the program is not incorrect in terms of identifying the necessary splits, but it does not fully implement the optimal solution as described in the problem statement.

**Final: False**
