Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Total Digits**: The `total_digits` variable should count the total number of digits in the numbers, not the lengths of the strings. The current implementation sums the lengths of the string representations of the numbers, which is incorrect.

2. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is used to count trailing zeros in a number. However, the logic for counting trailing zeros is flawed. It should convert the number to a string, reverse it, and then count the zeros. The current implementation is not doing that correctly.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Determining the Winner**: The logic for determining the winner is based on the difference between `total_digits` and `subtract_zero`. This approach does not correctly simulate the game rules and cannot accurately determine the winner based on the given conditions.

4. **Missing Handling of Game Rules**: The solution does not properly handle the game rules where players take turns and the game ends when Sasha can't make a move. The current implementation does not simulate the game steps and outcomes.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to implement a strategy that simulates the game and determines the winner based on the optimal moves of both players. The current solution does not achieve this.
