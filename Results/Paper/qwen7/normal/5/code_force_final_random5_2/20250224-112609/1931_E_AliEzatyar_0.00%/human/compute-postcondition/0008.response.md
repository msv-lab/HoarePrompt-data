Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `len(num) - 1` to `0` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`. This means it starts from the last element of `num` and goes backwards.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `counter` is 1 if the last element of `num` is '0'. Otherwise, `counter` remains 0.
   - `num` has at least one element.
   - `i` is `len(num) - 1`.
   - `num[i]` is not '0'.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `len(num) - 2`.
   - We need to check if `num[i]` is '0' to update `counter`.

Given these points, let's adjust the states for the next iteration:

- `i` will be `len(num) - 2`.
- `num[i]` will be the element at the position `len(num) - 2`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `num[len(num) - 2]`, we keep it as a general case. However, the key is to ensure that the loop continues based on the updated `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`counter` is 1 if the element at position `len(num) - 2` is '0'. Otherwise, `counter` remains 0, `num` has at least one element, `i` is `len(num) - 2`, and `num[i]` is not '0'**.
