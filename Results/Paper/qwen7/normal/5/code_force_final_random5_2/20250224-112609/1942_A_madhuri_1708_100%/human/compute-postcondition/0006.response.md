Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- The first part of `s` converted to an integer is equal to `n`.
- The second part of `s` converted to an integer is equal to `k`.
- The current value of `k` is equal to `n`.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(*[k for j in range(k)])
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The expression `[k for j in range(k)]` creates a list with `k` occurrences of the value `k`.
2. Since `k` is the second part of `s` converted to an integer, and the current value of `k` is equal to `n`, `k` is the same as `n`.
3. Therefore, the list comprehension `[k for j in range(k)]` becomes `[n for j in range(n)]`, which results in a list with `n` occurrences of `n`.

When this list is passed to the `print` function with the `*` operator, it unpacks the list and prints each element separated by a space.

So, the output will be `n` repeated `n` times, separated by spaces.

Output: **n n ... n (n times)**
