You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3.
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        n, k = map(int, s.split())
        
        if k >= 2:
            if n == k:
                print(*[k for j in range(k)])
            else:
                print('-1')
        else:
            print(*[(j + 1) for j in range(n)])
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will continue to read lines from standard input until there are no more lines to read. For each line, it will parse `n` and `k` as integers. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop will check if `n` equals `k`. If they are equal, it will print a list with `k` occurrences of `k`. If `n` does not equal `k`, it will print `-1`. If `k` is less than 2, it will print a list with `n` occurrences of integers starting from 1 up to `n`.
    #
    #The final output state will be determined by all the lines processed by the loop. Each line processed will contribute to the output based on the conditions specified in the loop body. If the end of the input is reached, the loop will terminate, and the output will consist of all the printed lists from each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each `t`, two integers `n` and `k` are given such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^3. The function returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
