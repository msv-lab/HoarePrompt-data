The function processes input data from standard input, where each line contains two integers \( n \) and \( k \) separated by a space, with \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^3 \). For each line, if \( k \geq 2 \), it checks if \( n \) equals \( k \); if true, it prints a list with \( k \) occurrences of \( k \); otherwise, it prints \(-1\). If \( k < 2 \), it prints a list with \( n \) occurrences of integers starting from 1 up to \( n \). The function continues processing lines until the end of input is reached, and it does not return any value.
