Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- The first part of `s` converted to an integer is equal to `n`.
- The second part of `s` converted to an integer is equal to `k`.
- The current value of `k` is greater than or equal to 2.
- `n` is not equal to `k`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('-1')
```

This `print` statement directly outputs the string `-1` without any reference to the variables `n`, `k`, or `t`.

Output: **-1**
