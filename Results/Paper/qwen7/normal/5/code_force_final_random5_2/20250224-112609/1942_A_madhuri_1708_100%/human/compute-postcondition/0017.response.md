Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `n` is an integer obtained from splitting the string `s` by spaces and converting the first part to an integer.
   - `k` is an integer obtained from splitting the string `s` by spaces and converting the second part to an integer.
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, then either `n` equals `k` or `n` does not equal `k`.
   - If `k` is less than 2, then no changes are made to `n` and `k`.

2. **Loop Head**:
   - The loop iterates over each line in the input file (excluding the first line), where each line is split by spaces.

3. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are lines left to read from the input file.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - The only objects in the loop head are `s`, which is the current line being processed.
   - Since the loop reads the next line from the input file, the state of `t`, `n`, and `k` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

5. **Post-Condition for the Loop**:
   - The loop will continue until there are no more lines to read from the input file.

Given these points, the states of `t`, `n`, and `k` do not change within the loop itself. Therefore, the states remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an integer obtained from splitting the string `s` by spaces and converting the first part to an integer, `k` is an integer obtained from splitting the string `s` by spaces and converting the second part to an integer. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, then either `n` equals `k` or `n` does not equal `k`. If `k` is less than 2, then no changes are made to `n` and `k`.**
