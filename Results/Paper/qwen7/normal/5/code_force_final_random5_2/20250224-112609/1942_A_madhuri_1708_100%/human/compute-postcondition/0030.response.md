Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\); `n` is the integer obtained from the first part of the next line of input split by spaces and converted to an integer; `k` is the integer obtained from the second part of the next line of input split by spaces and converted to an integer. Regardless of whether `k` is greater than or equal to 2, these values remain unchanged.
