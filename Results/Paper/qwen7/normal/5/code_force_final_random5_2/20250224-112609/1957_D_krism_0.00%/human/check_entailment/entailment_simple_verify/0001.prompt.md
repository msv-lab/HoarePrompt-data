You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the number of tuples (x,
y, z ) such that:

  * 1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n , and 
  * f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) . 

We define f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r} , where
\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the number of
described tuples.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    6 2 4
    
    1
    
    3
    
    5
    
    7 3 7 2 1

Output

    4
    0
    16
    
Note

In the first case, there are 4 such tuples in the array [6, 2, 4] :

  * (1 , 2 , 2 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2) = 4 \oplus 2 > (a_1 \oplus a_2) = 4 
  * (1 , 1 , 3 ): (a_1) \oplus (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 6 \oplus 0 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 2 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2 \oplus a_3) = 4 \oplus 6 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 3 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) \oplus (a_3) = 0 \oplus 4 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 

In the second test case, there are no such tuples.

    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all 32 iterations, the variable `i` will be 33 (though it doesn't affect the final state of `suf` and `pre`), `y` and `c` will be undefined because they refer to indices out of bounds, `k` will be 5 (the bit length of `y` minus 1), `ans` will be the accumulated sum calculated during the loop, and for each bit position `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][0]` and `suf[j][1]` will be 0, indicating no more counts left to decrement. The `pre[j][0]` and `pre[j][1]` will hold the total counts of 0s and 1s across all 32 bits processed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Initializing Variables:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It initializes a prefix XOR array `prefix` where `prefix[i]` stores the cumulative XOR from the start up to index `i-1`.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - The prefix XOR array is correctly calculated using the formula `prefix[i] = v ^ prefix[i-1]`, which ensures that `prefix[i]` represents the XOR of elements from the start up to index `i-1`.

3. **Preprocessing Arrays `pre` and `suf`:**
   - Arrays `pre` and `suf` are used to count the number of times each bit position has been set to 1 or 0 in the prefix and suffix parts of the array.
   - These arrays are initialized with some default values, but the logic for updating them seems incomplete and incorrect.

4. **Counting Valid Tuples:**
   - The program attempts to count the number of valid tuples `(x, y, z)` by iterating through possible values of `y` and using the preprocessed arrays `pre` and `suf`.
   - However, the logic for updating and using these arrays is flawed. Specifically, the way `pre` and `suf` are updated and used does not correctly reflect the required conditions for the tuples.

5. **Bit Manipulation and Bit Length:**
   - The program uses bit manipulation to determine the bit length of the current value `c` (which is `prefix[i]`), but this is not necessary for the problem at hand. The XOR operation and comparison can be done directly without needing to know the bit length.

6. **Final Count Calculation:**
   - The final count calculation seems to be attempting to use the preprocessed arrays to count valid tuples, but the logic is incorrect because the arrays are not being updated properly to reflect the XOR conditions.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid tuples `(x, y, z)` that satisfy the given conditions. The preprocessing and counting logic are flawed, leading to incorrect results.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
