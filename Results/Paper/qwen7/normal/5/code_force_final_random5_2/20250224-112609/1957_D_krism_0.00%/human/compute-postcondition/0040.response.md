Output State: **`i` is 31, `n` is 31, `cur` is `prefix[31]`, `j` is 2, `suf[2][1]` is 1**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `suf[j][1]` by 1. Given that `j` is 2, `suf[2][1]` is incremented by 1. Since `suf[2][1]` was initially 0 (as it is not specified otherwise), it becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
