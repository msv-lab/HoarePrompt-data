Output State: **`i` is 29, `n` is 31, `cur` is `prefix[29]`, `j` is 32, `suf` is a 32x2 matrix where for each `j` from 0 to 31: if the bit at position `j` in `cur` (which is `prefix[29]`) is 1, then `suf[j][1]` is the count of occurrences where `prefix[29] >> j & 1` was true; if the bit at position `j` in `cur` is 0, then `suf[j][0]` is the count of occurrences where `prefix[29] >> j & 1` was false.**

Explanation:
- The line `cur = prefix[i]` changes the value of `cur` to `prefix[29]`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `j`, and `suf`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
- The matrix `suf` is updated based on the new value of `cur`, which is `prefix[29]`.
