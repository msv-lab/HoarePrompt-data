Postcondition: `j` is 32; `c` is an integer where the bit at position 31 is 0 or `suf[31][1]` is decremented by 1. If the bit at position 31 of `c` is 0, `pre[31][0]` is 0, `pre[31][1]` is 1, `suf[31][0]` is -1, and `suf[31][1]` is 0. If the bit at position 31 of `c` is 1, `pre[31][0]` is 1, `pre[31][1]` is 0, `suf[31][0]` is -2, and `suf[31][1]` is 0.
