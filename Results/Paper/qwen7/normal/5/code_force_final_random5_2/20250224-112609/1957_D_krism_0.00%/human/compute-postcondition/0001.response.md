Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and retains its initial state as a positive integer between 1 and 10^4. The precondition that the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5 remains valid.
