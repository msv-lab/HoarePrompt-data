Output State: **`cur` is an integer, `j` is `j + 1`, `suf` is a list where each element is a tuple `[int + 1, int]`**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][0] += 1` increments the first element of the tuple at index `j` in the list `suf` by 1. Since `j` was previously set to `j + 1`, the correct index to modify is `j - 1`. However, the initial state does not specify the exact value of `j`, only that it was `j + 1` before the increment. Thus, the first element of the tuple at index `j - 1` in `suf` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
