Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` is 31, `cur` is undefined, `j` is 32, `suf` is a 32x2 matrix where for each `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` is 32 and `suf[j][0]` is 32, `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `ans = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The variable `cur` is referenced but not reassigned or used in any way, so it remains undefined.
