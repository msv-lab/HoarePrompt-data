You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the number of tuples (x,
y, z ) such that:

  * 1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n , and 
  * f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) . 

We define f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r} , where
\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the number of
described tuples.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    6 2 4
    
    1
    
    3
    
    5
    
    7 3 7 2 1

Output

    4
    0
    16
    
Note

In the first case, there are 4 such tuples in the array [6, 2, 4] :

  * (1 , 2 , 2 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2) = 4 \oplus 2 > (a_1 \oplus a_2) = 4 
  * (1 , 1 , 3 ): (a_1) \oplus (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 6 \oplus 0 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 2 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2 \oplus a_3) = 4 \oplus 6 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 3 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) \oplus (a_3) = 0 \oplus 4 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 

In the second test case, there are no such tuples.

    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all 32 iterations, the variable `i` will be 33 (though it doesn't affect the final state of `suf` and `pre`), `y` and `c` will be undefined because they refer to indices out of bounds, `k` will be 5 (the bit length of `y` minus 1), `ans` will be the accumulated sum calculated during the loop, and for each bit position `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][0]` and `suf[j][1]` will be 0, indicating no more counts left to decrement. The `pre[j][0]` and `pre[j][1]` will hold the total counts of 0s and 1s across all 32 bits processed.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( t \) (number of test cases) and for each test case, an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, ..., a_n \). For each test case, it calculates and prints the cumulative XOR values of the list elements and then performs bitwise operations to count the occurrences of 0s and 1s for each bit position across all elements. Finally, it computes and prints a result based on these counts, which is always 0 in this specific implementation.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not properly calculate the number of tuples \((x, y, z)\) that satisfy the condition \(f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z)\).

Here's a breakdown of the issues:
1. **Prefix XOR Calculation**: The prefix XOR array `prefix` is calculated correctly.
2. **Pre and Suffix Arrays Initialization**: The `pre` and `suf` arrays are initialized incorrectly. They should be used to count the number of times each bit position is set to 1 or 0 in the prefix and suffix ranges, but the current implementation does not achieve this.
3. **Counting Valid Tuples**: The logic to count valid tuples is flawed. The program attempts to count the number of valid tuples using the `pre` and `suf` arrays, but it does not correctly handle the XOR operation and the conditions specified in the problem.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
```
3
3
6 2 4
```
The expected output is 4, as mentioned in the example. However, the provided program does not produce the correct result. The program fails to correctly count the number of valid tuples due to the incorrect initialization and usage of the `pre` and `suf` arrays.

A correct solution would involve maintaining the prefix XOR values and using them to efficiently count the number of valid tuples. The provided program does not achieve this, hence it is incorrect.
