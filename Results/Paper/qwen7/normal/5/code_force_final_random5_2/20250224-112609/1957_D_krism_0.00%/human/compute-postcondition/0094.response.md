Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is -1
- `n` is 31
- `cur` is `prefix[-1]` (which is out of index, so it doesn't exist and would raise an error if accessed)
- `j` is 32
- `suf` is a 32x2 matrix where for each `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][1]` is 32 and `suf[j][0]` is 32.

The `print(suf)` statement will print the entire `suf` matrix. Given the description of `suf`, each row in the matrix will have two elements, both being 32.

Output: **[[32, 32], [32, 32], ..., [32, 32]] (a 32x2 matrix with each element being 32)**
