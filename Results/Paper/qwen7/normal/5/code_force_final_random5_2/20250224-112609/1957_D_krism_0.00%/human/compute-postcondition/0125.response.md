Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is 31, `y` is `arr[0]`, `k` is 5, `ans` is `ans` + `pre[5][0] * suf[5][0] + pre[5][1] * suf[5][1]`, `c` is `prefix[1]`, `j` is 3, and either `suf[3][1]` is decreased by 1 if `prefix[1]` shifted right by 3 bits and bitwise AND with 1 is 1, or `suf[3][0]` is decreased by 1 otherwise.
