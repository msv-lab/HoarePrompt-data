Postcondition: `c` is an integer, `j` is an integer + 1 (or 0 if `j` was 31), `pre` is the same array, and `suf` is the same array. If the result of `c >> j & 1` is true, then `suf[j][1]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, the first element of the `j`-th subarray in `pre` is increased by 1, and the first element of the `j`-th subarray in `suf` is decreased by 1.
