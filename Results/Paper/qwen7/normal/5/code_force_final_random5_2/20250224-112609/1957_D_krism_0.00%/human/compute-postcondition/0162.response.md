Output State: **`j` is 32, `c` is `prefix[i]`, `pre[j][0]` and `pre[j][1]` reflect the count of 0s and 1s up to that bit position, `suf[j][0]` and `suf[j][1]` reflect the count of 0s and 1s from that bit position to the end of the integer `c`, `k` is the bit length of `y` minus 1, `y` is equal to `arr[i - 1]`, `ans` is increased by `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `c` to `prefix[i]`. The values of `j`, `pre[j][0]`, `pre[j][1]`, `suf[j][0]`, `suf[j][1]`, `k`, `y`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their previous states.
