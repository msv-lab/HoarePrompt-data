Output State: **`i` is 30, `n` is 31, `cur` is `prefix[30]`, `j` is 2, `suf` is a 32x2 matrix where for each `j` from 0 to 31, if `prefix[30] >> j & 1` was true for any iteration, `suf[j][1]` is the count of such occurrences plus 1, otherwise `suf[j][0]` remains the same, and `cur >> j & 1` is false.**

Explanation: The code `suf[j][1] += 1` increments the value of `suf[j][1]` by 1. Given the initial state, `j` was 1, and now it has been incremented to 2. Since `cur >> j & 1` is true initially (meaning `suf[j][1]` was incremented), `suf[j][1]` is incremented by 1. For all other values of `j`, `suf[j][0]` remains unchanged. Additionally, since `cur >> j & 1` is no longer true for `j = 2`, `suf[2][1]` is not incremented, and `suf[2][0]` remains 0.
