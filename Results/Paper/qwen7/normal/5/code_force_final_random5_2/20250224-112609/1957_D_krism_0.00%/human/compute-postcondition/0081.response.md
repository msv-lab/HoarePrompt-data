Output State: **`cur` is an integer, `j` is `j + 1`, `suf` is a list where each element is a tuple `[int, int]` with the second element of the `j`th tuple increased by 1.**

This means that the value of `suf[j][1]` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `cur` and `j` remain as they were initially, and `suf` is updated accordingly.
