Output State: **`prefix` is now `[0, v ^ 0, v ^ v]`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer (excluding the first element), `v` is the second element of `arr`**.

Explanation: The code appends a new value to the `prefix` list. The new value is calculated as `v ^ prefix[-1]`, where `^` denotes the bitwise XOR operation. Since `prefix[-1]` is `v ^ 0` (which is just `v` because anything XORed with 0 is itself), the new value appended to `prefix` is `v ^ v`, which is `0`. Therefore, `prefix` becomes `[0, v ^ 0, v ^ v]`, which simplifies to `[0, v, 0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
