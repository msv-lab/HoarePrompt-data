Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(32)`. The only variable directly controlled by this loop is `j`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `j`**: Since the loop starts from `j = 0` (as per the `range(32)`), at the start of the first iteration, `j` is 0.

3. **Understand the Postcondition**: The postcondition states that `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration. This means that after each iteration, `j` will be one more than its value at the start of the iteration.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**: Given that `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `j + 1`.

5. **Consider the Range**: The loop runs for `j` in the range `0` to `31`. Therefore, after the 31st iteration, `j` will be 31. For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than 32.

Given these points, let's adjust the state for the next iteration:

- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was `j + 1`.
- For the next iteration, `j` should be `j + 1` again, but since we are starting a new iteration, `j` will be `0` if it is the first iteration or `j + 1` for subsequent iterations.

Since we don't know the exact value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration, we can generalize that `j` will be `j + 1` for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state for the next iteration is:

**State: **`cur` is an integer, `j` is `j + 1`, `suf` is a list where each element is a tuple `[int, int]`**.
