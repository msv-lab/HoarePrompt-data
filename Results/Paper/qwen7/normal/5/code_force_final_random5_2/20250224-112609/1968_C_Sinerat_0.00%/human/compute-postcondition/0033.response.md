Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive of 1 but exclusive of `n`).
3. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, we need to ensure that `i` is set to 1 at the start of the loop.
4. **Ensure the loop can execute**: For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1.

Given these points, let's adjust the states accordingly:

- The variable `i` should be set to 1.
- The variable `n` should be greater than 1.

The other variables (`_`, `x`, and `a`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
