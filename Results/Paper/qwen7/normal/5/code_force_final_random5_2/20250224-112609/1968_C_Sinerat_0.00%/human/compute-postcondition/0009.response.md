Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `x` is a list of integers
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` is 500 and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`
   - `i` is `i + 1`
   - `a[i]` is `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`

2. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n):`

3. **Adjusting States:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i + 1`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be within the range `1` to `n-1`.
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

5. **Conditions for Next Iteration:**
   - `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to continue.
   - Therefore, `i + 1` must be less than `n`.

6. **Updated States:**
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `x` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `a` remains unchanged as it is not directly involved in the loop (though its values may change inside the loop).
   - `i` is updated to `i + 1`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` is updated to `i + 1`.
- `i + 1` must be less than `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 1, `x` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` is 500 and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `i + 1` must be less than `n`**
