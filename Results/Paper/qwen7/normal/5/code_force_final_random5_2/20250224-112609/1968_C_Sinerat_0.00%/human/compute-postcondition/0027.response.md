Based on the initial state described, the list `a` is transformed such that each element `a[i]` (for \(0 \leq i < n\)) is the sum of 500 and the cumulative sum of the first \(i\) elements of the list `x`. This means:

- `a[0] = 500 + sum(x[:1]) = 500 + x[0]`
- `a[1] = 500 + sum(x[:2]) = 500 + x[0] + x[1]`
- ...
- `a[n-1] = 500 + sum(x[:n]) = 500 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-1]`

When the `print(*a)` statement is executed, it will print the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

Output: **500 + x[0] 500 + x[0] + x[1] ... 500 + x[0] + x[1] + ... + x[n-1]**
