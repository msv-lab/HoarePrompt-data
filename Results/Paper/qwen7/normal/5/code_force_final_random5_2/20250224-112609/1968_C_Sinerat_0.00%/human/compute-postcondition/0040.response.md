Output State: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 1, and `a[i]` is equal to `a[n-2] + x[n-2]`. This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the loop counter `i` will be one less than `n`, `n` must still be greater than 1, and the last element of list `a` (which is `a[n-1]`) will be the sum of the previous element `a[n-2]` and the corresponding element from list `x` (which is `x[n-2]`).
