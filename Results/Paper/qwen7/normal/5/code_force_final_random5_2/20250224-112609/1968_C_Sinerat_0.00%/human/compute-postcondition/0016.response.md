Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers entered by the user, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `a[0]` is 500 and for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is the sum of all previous elements in the list `x` up to index `i-1` added to 500.**

Explanation: The code `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the user input and converts them into a list of integers. This changes the value of `x` to the list of integers entered by the user. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged as the code does not modify them.
