Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer greater than 1.
   - `x` is a list of integers.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where:
     - `a[0] = 500`.
     - For each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is the sum of all previous elements in the list `x` up to index `i-1` added to 500.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(*a)
   ```

Given the initial state, let's determine the values of the elements in list `a`:

- `a[0]` is explicitly given as 500.
- For `a[1]`, it is the sum of all previous elements in `x` up to index 0 (which is just `x[0]`) plus 500. So, `a[1] = x[0] + 500`.
- For `a[2]`, it is the sum of all previous elements in `x` up to index 1 (which are `x[0]` and `x[1]`) plus 500. So, `a[2] = x[0] + x[1] + 500`.
- This pattern continues until `a[n-1]`, which is the sum of all elements in `x` up to index `n-2` plus 500. So, `a[n-1] = (sum of x[0] to x[n-2]) + 500`.

Therefore, the list `a` will look like this:
\[ a = [500, x[0] + 500, x[0] + x[1] + 500, \ldots, \text{(sum of } x[0] \text{ to } x[n-2]\text{)} + 500] \]

When the `print(*a)` statement is executed, it will print the elements of list `a` separated by spaces.

Output: **500 x[0] + 500 x[0] + x[1] + 500 ... (sum of x[0] to x[n-2]) + 500**
