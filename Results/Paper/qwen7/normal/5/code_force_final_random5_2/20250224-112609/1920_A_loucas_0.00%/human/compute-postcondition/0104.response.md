Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step:

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `innerLoop` must be greater than 2
- `i` is currently `num`
- `less` must contain at least 3 integers
- `no` must contain at least 3 integers
- `big` must contain at least 1 integer
- The postcondition remains unchanged if the condition `i not in no` is false.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(max(big), min(less)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head defines the range of `i` as `max(big)` to `min(less)`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range defined by `max(big)` to `min(less)`.
3. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `num`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Determine the Range of `i`**:
   - `max(big)` is the starting point of the range.
   - `min(less)` is the ending point of the range.
   
2. **Check the Current Value of `i`**:
   - The current value of `i` is `num`.
   - For the loop to continue, `num` must be within the range `[max(big), min(less))`.

3. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since `i` (which is `num`) must be within the range defined by `max(big)` to `min(less)`, we need to ensure that `num` falls within this range.
   - If `num` is within the range, the loop will continue. Otherwise, it will terminate.

### Adjusted State:
- `innerLoop` must be greater than 2 (unchanged)
- `i` must be within the range `[max(big), min(less))` (i.e., `i` must be `num` and `num` must be within the range).
- `less` must contain at least 3 integers (unchanged)
- `no` must contain at least 3 integers (unchanged)
- `big` must contain at least 1 integer (unchanged)

### Final Answer:
State: **`innerLoop` must be greater than 2, `i` must be within the range `[max(big), min(less))`, `less` must contain at least 3 integers, `no` must contain at least 3 integers, `big` must contain at least 1 integer**.
