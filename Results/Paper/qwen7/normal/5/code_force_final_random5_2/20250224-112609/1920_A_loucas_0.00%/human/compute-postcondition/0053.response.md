Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `min(less)`
   - `num` is `min(less)`
   - The condition for breaking out of the loop is if `i` is not in `no`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(max(big), min(less)):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop variable `i` is defined in the loop head.
   - The loop runs from `max(big)` to `min(less)`.

4. **Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be within the range `max(big)` to `min(less)`.
   - The loop will stop if `i` is not in the set `no`.

5. **Current State Analysis:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `min(less)`.
   - Since `i` is equal to `min(less)`, it is at the lower bound of the range specified by the loop.
   - The loop will increment `i` by 1 in the next iteration (if possible).

6. **Next Iteration Check:**
   - After the current iteration, `i` will be incremented to `min(less) + 1`.
   - We need to ensure that `min(less) + 1` is still within the range `max(big)` to `min(less)`.
   - If `min(less) + 1` is still within this range, the loop will continue.
   - If `min(less) + 1` is not within the range, the loop will stop.

7. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`.
   - The value of `i` will be `min(less) + 1` for the next iteration.
   - The value of `num` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - The condition for breaking out of the loop remains the same.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is `min(less) + 1`, `num` is `min(less)`, if `i` is not in `no`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
