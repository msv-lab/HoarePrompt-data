Postcondition: `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is 1, `less` is either an empty list or a list containing `a`, `big` is a list containing `a`, `no` is either an empty list or a list containing `[a]`, `num` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer. If `x` is equal to 1, `big` will contain `a`. Otherwise, `less` and `big` will each be either empty or contain `a`, and `no` will contain `[a]`.
