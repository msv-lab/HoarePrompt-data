Postcondition: **`innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is 0, `less` is either an empty list or a list containing `a`, `big` is either an empty list or a list containing `a`, `no` is either an empty list or a list containing `[a]`, `num` is 0, and `x` is an input integer. If `x` equals 1, `big` will contain `a`. Otherwise, `less` and `no` will each be either an empty list or a list containing `a`.**
