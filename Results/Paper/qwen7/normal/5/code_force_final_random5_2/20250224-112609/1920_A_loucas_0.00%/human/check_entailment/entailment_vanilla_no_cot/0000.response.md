Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly compute the number of integers \( k \) that satisfy all the constraints. Here's why:

1. **Logic Flaw**: The current logic only checks for the first valid \( k \) between the maximum value from the "greater than" constraints (`big`) and the minimum value from the "less than or equal to" constraints (`less`). However, it should count all such values, not just the first one.

2. **Counting Valid Values**: Instead of printing just one value `num`, you need to count how many integers fall within the valid range and are not in the "not equal to" list.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for iterable in range(loop):
        big = []
        less = []
        no = set()
        valid_count = 0
        innerLoop = int(input())
        for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
            (x, a) = map(int, input().split())
            if x == 1:
                big.append(a)
            elif x == 2:
                less.append(a)
            else:
                no.add(a)
        
        # Find the intersection of the ranges and exclude the 'not equal to' values
        max_big = max(big) if big else float('inf')
        min_less = min(less) if less else -1
        
        for i in range(max_big, min_less + 1):
            if i not in no:
                valid_count += 1
        
        print(valid_count)
```

This corrected version:
- Uses a set for `no` to efficiently check membership.
- Counts all valid integers between the maximum of the "greater than" constraints and the minimum of the "less than or equal to" constraints, excluding those in the "not equal to" list.
