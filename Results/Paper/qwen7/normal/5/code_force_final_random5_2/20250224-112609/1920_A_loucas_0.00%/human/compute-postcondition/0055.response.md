Output State: **`i` is `min(less) + 1`, `num` is `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or if statement where `i` is checked against the list `no`. The values of `i` and `num` remain unchanged because the `break` statement does not modify any variables. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions specified.
