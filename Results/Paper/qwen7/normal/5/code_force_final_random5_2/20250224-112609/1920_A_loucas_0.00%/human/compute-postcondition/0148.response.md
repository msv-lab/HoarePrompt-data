Postcondition: **`innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is 2, `less` is either an empty list or a list containing `a`, `big` is a list containing `a`, `no` is either an empty list or a list containing `[a]`, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `num` is 0.**

This postcondition remains the same because the if and else parts do not change the values of the variables listed in the precondition. The only difference is in the `less` list: if `x == 2`, `less` becomes a list containing `a`; otherwise, `less` remains either an empty list or a list containing `[a]`. However, since both cases are covered by the postcondition stating that `less` is either an empty list or a list containing `a`, the overall postcondition does not change.
