Postcondition: **`innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is 2, `less` is either an empty list or a list containing `a`, `big` is a list containing `a`, `no` is either an empty list or a list containing `[a]`, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `num` is 0.** 

This postcondition remains unchanged because the if and else parts do not alter the variables `innerLoop`, `iterable2`, `less`, `big`, `no`, `x`, `a`, or `num`. The only difference is in the handling of the variable `big` when `x == 1`, which adds an additional element `a` to the list, but since the else part does not change this behavior, the overall postcondition includes both scenarios without conflict.
