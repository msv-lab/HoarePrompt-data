Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(max(big), min(less))`.

   - The variable `i` is being iterated over a range defined by `max(big)` and `min(less)`.
   - The variables `max(big)` and `min(less)` are constants for this loop and do not change within the loop.

2. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `innerLoop` must be greater than 0.
   - `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop - 1`.
   - The postcondition `i not in no` is checked, and if it is true, the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` is being incremented in each iteration of the loop, we need to determine the value of `i` at the start of the next iteration.
   - We also need to ensure that the loop continues as long as `i` is within the range defined by `max(big)` and `min(less)`.

4. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be within the range `max(big)` to `min(less)`.
   - After the previous iteration, `i` was in the range, and now it needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
   - The postcondition `i not in no` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- `i` will be incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `innerLoop` must remain greater than 0.
- `iterable2` should be updated to `innerLoop - 1` for the next iteration.

Since `max(big)` and `min(less)` are constants and do not change, they remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is equal to `innerLoop - 1`, `i` is `max(big)` (if it is the first iteration) or `i + 1` from the previous value, and `i not in no` must still hold true.**
