Output State: **`innerLoop` must be greater than 2, `i` must be within the range `[max(big), min(less))`, `less` must contain at least 3 integers, `no` must contain at least 3 integers, `big` must contain at least 1 integer, `num` is equal to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is placed in. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. The values of the variables `innerLoop`, `i`, `less`, `no`, `big`, and `num` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
