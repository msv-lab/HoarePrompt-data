Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head defines the variables `i` and the range it iterates over. Specifically, the loop iterates over `range(max(big), min(less))`.

2. **Understand the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is within the range defined by `max(big)` and `min(less) - 1`.

3. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is an integer within the range `min(less)` to `max(big) - 1`, and `num` is equal to `i`. Additionally, if `i` is not in the set `no`, the loop breaks.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is within the range `max(big)` to `min(less) - 1`.
   - Since `i` was within this range at the end of the previous iteration, it means `i` is currently `min(less) - 1`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it `min(less)`.

5. **Check the Set `no`**:
   - If `i` (which is now `min(less)`) is not in the set `no`, the loop will break.
   - If `i` is in the set `no`, the loop will continue to the next iteration.

Given these points, we can conclude that at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be `min(less)`.
- `num` will be equal to `i`, so `num` will be `min(less)`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `min(less)`, `num` is equal to `min(less)`**
