#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, and s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1', where s1 represents the initial state of the boxes and s2 represents the desired state of the boxes.
def func_1(n, s1, s2):
    cats_to_add = sum(1 for i in range(n) if s1[i] == '0' and s2[i] == '1')
    cats_to_remove = sum(1 for i in range(n) if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0')
    return max(cats_to_add, cats_to_remove)
    #The program returns the maximum value between the number of positions where s1[i] is '0' and s2[i] is '1', and the number of positions where s1[i] is '1' and s2[i] is '0'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `s1`, and `s2`. `n` is a positive integer, and both `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1'. It calculates and returns the maximum value between the number of positions where `s1[i]` is '0' and `s2[i]` is '1', and the number of positions where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0'.
