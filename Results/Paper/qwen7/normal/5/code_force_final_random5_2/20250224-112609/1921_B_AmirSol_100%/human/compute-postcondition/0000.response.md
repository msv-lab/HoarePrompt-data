Output State: **`cats_to_add` is the number of positions where `s1[i]` is '0' and `s2[i]` is '1' for `i` in the range of `n`. `n` is a positive integer, and `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1'.**

This means that `cats_to_add` will store the count of positions where the characters in `s1` are '0' and the corresponding characters in `s2` are '1'. The values of `n`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged from their initial states.
