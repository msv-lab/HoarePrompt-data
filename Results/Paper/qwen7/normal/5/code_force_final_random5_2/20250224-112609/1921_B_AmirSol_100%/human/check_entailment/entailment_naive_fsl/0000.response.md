Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state of the boxes into the desired state. The logic in `func_1` accurately computes the number of cats that need to be added (`cats_to_add`) and the number of cats that need to be removed (`cats_to_remove`). The maximum of these two values gives the minimum number of operations needed, as each operation can either add or remove a cat.

Let's break down the logic:
- `cats_to_add` is calculated by counting the positions where the initial state (`s1`) has a '0' but the desired state (`s2`) has a '1'.
- `cats_to_remove` is calculated by counting the positions where the initial state (`s1`) has a '1' but the desired state (`s2`) has a '0'.

The program then returns the maximum of these two counts, which correctly represents the minimum number of operations required. Since this logic covers all potential cases without any missing edge cases, the program is correct.
