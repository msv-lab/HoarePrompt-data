Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in s:`. This means the loop iterates over each character in the list `s`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop head variables**:
   - `i`: This variable will take on the value of each character in the list `s` during each iteration.
   - `s`: This is the list of characters that the loop will iterate over.

3. **Check the provided initial state**:
   - `s` is a list of characters entered by the user.
   - `ret` is 0 (though this variable is not used in the loop head).
   - `thorn` is 0 (though this variable is not used in the loop head).
   - `len` is an input integer, but it is not directly used in the loop head either.

4. **Adjust the states for the loop to execute**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each character in `s`, the list `s` must contain at least one character for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `i` will start as the first character in the list `s`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `s` must be a non-empty list (at least one character).
- `i` will be the first character in the list `s`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty list of characters, `i` is the first character in the list `s`**
