Output State: **`thorn` is 1 or 4, `ret` is 1 plus the original value of `ret`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `len` is an input integer, `s` is a list of characters from user input that must have at least one character (minus the first character)**.

Explanation: The line `ret += 1` increments the value of `ret` by 1. The value of `thorn` is either 1 or 3 based on the conditions mentioned, and it is incremented by 1 if the character `i` is '*', but since no such condition is present in the given code snippet, its value remains unchanged. All other variables (`t`, `len`, `s`) remain unaffected.
