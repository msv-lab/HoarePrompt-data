Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty list of characters, `i` is the first character in the list `s`. If the first character `i` is '@', then `thorn` is 1 and `ret` is 1. If the first character `i` is '*', then `thorn` is 2 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the first character `i` is neither '@' nor '*', then `thorn` is 0.
