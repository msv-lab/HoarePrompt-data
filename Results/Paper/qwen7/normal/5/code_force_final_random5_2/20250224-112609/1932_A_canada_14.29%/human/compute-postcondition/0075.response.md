Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `s`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the list `s`. Therefore, the loop will continue until `s` is empty.

3. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `s` is a list of characters with at least one character.
   - `i` is a character from the list `s`.
   - `thorn` is either 0 or 1 based on the value of `i`.
   - If `i` is '@', `thorn` remains 0 and `ret` is 1.
   - If `i` is '*', `thorn` is either 1 (and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of if `thorn` equals 2) or 0.
   - If `i` is neither '@' nor '*', `thorn` remains 0.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop will execute again, `s` must still contain at least one character.
   - `i` will be the next character in the list `s`.
   - `thorn` will be either 0 or 1 based on the value of `i`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `s` must still be a list of characters with at least one character.
- `i` will be the next character in the list `s`.
- `thorn` will be either 0 or 1 based on the value of `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`s` is a list of characters with at least one character, `i` is the next character in the list, `thorn` is either 0 or 1 based on the value of `i`**.
