Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` are both `True`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `j` is `n - 1`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `j` in the range from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Loop Head:**
   - The loop head involves the variable `j`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since the loop runs for `j` in the range from `0` to `n-1`, at the end of each iteration, `j` is incremented by 1.
   - The loop will continue as long as `j < n`.

5. **Current Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `n - 1`.

6. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `j` should be incremented by 1, making it `n`.

7. **Other Variables:**
   - `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain unchanged since the condition `reachable_second_row` is met and no changes are made to these variables within the loop.
   - `n` remains the same.

8. **Final State:**
   - `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` are still `True`.
   - `n` is still greater than 0.
   - `j` is now `n`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` are both `True`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `j` is `n`**.
