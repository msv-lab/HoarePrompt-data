Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the `func_1` function to determine if it correctly determines whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n).

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes `reachable_first_row` to `True` and `reachable_second_row` to `False`. These flags help track whether the robot can still be in the first row or has moved to the second row.

2. **Loop through each column**: For each column `j` from 0 to `n-1`, the function checks the direction of the arrow in the current column of both rows.

3. **First Row Logic**:
   - If the arrow in the first row (`row1[j]`) is `'>`', the robot can move to the next column.
   - If the robot reaches the last column (`j == n - 1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` because it can now move to the second row.
   - If the arrow is `<`, the robot cannot move further in the first row, so `reachable_first_row` is set to `False`. If the robot is not at the last column and the arrow in the second row (`row2[j+1]`) is `'>`', it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`.

4. **Second Row Logic**:
   - If the arrow in the second row (`row2[j]`) is `'>`' and the robot is not at the last column, it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`.

5. **Result Determination**: After processing all columns, if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, the function appends `'YES'` to the results list; otherwise, it appends `'NO'`.

### Analysis:
- The logic correctly tracks the movement of the robot through the grid.
- The function ensures that the robot can only move to the second row if the arrows allow it to do so.
- The function correctly handles the edge case where the robot can move to the second row if the last column is reached with a `'>`' arrow in the first row.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the function correctly determines whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n).

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
