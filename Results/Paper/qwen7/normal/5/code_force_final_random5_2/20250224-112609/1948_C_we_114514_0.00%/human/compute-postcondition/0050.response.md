Postcondition: `reachable_second_row` remains `True`, `reachable_first_row` remains `True` if `row1[j+1] == '>'`, otherwise it is `False`, and `j` is incremented by 1. If `j < n - 1` and the element at index `j` in `row2` is '>', then `reachable_first_row` becomes `False`. If none of these conditions are met, `reachable_first_row` and `j` retain their original values.
