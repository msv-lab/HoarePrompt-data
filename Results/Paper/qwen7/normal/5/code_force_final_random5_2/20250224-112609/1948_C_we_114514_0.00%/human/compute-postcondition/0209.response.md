Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an even integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and two strings of length `n`, consisting only of '<' and '>' characters. The function returns a list called `results` that contains either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, indicating whether `reachable_second_row` became True for that specific test case. The length of the list matches the number of test cases in `test_cases`. For the last test case, `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` reflect the final state, `n` is the `n` value of the last test case, and `j` is `n - 1`.**
