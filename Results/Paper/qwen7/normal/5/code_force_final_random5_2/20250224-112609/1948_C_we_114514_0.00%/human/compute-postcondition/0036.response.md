Postcondition: **reachable_first_row is true if row1[j] == '>', otherwise it is false. reachable_second_row remains true regardless of the condition. If j is not decreased and remains as n - 1, it stays unchanged. If j is decreased due to row2[j] == '>', both reachable_first_row and reachable_second_row remain unchanged.**
