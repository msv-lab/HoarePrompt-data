Output State: **reachable_second_row is True, `reachable_first_row` remains `True` if `row1[j+1] == '>'`, otherwise it is `False`, and `j` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code simply sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`. This does not affect the values of `reachable_first_row` or `j`, which remain as they were in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects that `reachable_second_row` is now explicitly set to `True`, while the conditions for `reachable_first_row` and the increment of `j` remain unchanged from the initial state.
