Output State: **reachable_first_row is True or False, reachable_second_row is True, n is greater than 0, j is equal to n - 1, results contains 'YES'**.

The code appends the string 'YES' to the list `results`. Since `results` was not previously defined in the initial state, it is now a list containing 'YES'. All other variables retain their initial conditions.
