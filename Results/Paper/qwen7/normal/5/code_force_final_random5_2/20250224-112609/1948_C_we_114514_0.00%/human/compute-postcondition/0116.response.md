Output State: **`reachable_first_row` is True or False, `reachable_second_row` is True, `n` must be greater than 0, and `j` is equal to `n`.**

Explanation: The line `reachable_second_row = True` updates the value of `reachable_second_row` to `True`. The other variables (`reachable_first_row`, `n`, and `j`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
