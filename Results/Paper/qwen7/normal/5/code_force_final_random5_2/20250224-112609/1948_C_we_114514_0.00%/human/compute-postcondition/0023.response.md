Output State: **reachable_first_row is true, reachable_second_row is true, and j equals n - 1.**

Explanation: The code simply reassigns `reachable_second_row` to `True`. Since `reachable_first_row` and `j` were not affected by this line of code, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state retains the values of `reachable_first_row` as `true`, `reachable_second_row` as `true`, and `j` as `n - 1`.
