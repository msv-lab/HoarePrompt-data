### Reasoning

Let's systematically evaluate the program's behavior using the provided annotations and the original assessment.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size `n`, the first row of the grid (`row1`), and the second row of the grid (`row2`).

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It initializes two flags: `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row`.
     - `reachable_first_row` indicates if the robot can stay in the first row.
     - `reachable_second_row` indicates if the robot can reach the last column in the second row.
   - It iterates through each column `j` from 0 to `n-1`:
     - If the robot is in the first row and the arrow points to the right (`>`), it checks if it can move to the next column. If it reaches the last column, it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`.
     - If the robot is in the first row and the arrow points to the left (`<`), it cannot stay in the first row anymore, so it switches to the second row and checks if the arrow points to the right. If it does, it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`.
     - If the robot is in the second row and the arrow points to the right (`>`), it checks if it can move to the next column. If it reaches the last column, it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`.

3. **Determining the Result:**
   - After processing all columns, if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, it means the robot can reach the last column in the second row, and it appends `'YES'` to the results list.
   - Otherwise, it appends `'NO'` to the results list.

#### Verification Against Example Cases

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Grid:
     ```
     >><<
     >>><
     ```
   - The robot starts at (1, 1).
   - Moves to (1, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4).
   - The program correctly identifies this path and outputs `YES`.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Grid:
     ```
     ><
     ><
     ```
   - The robot starts at (1, 1).
   - Moves to (2, 1) -> (2, 2).
   - The program correctly identifies this path and outputs `YES`.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Grid:
     ```
     >>><
     >><<
     ```
   - The robot starts at (1, 1).
   - Moves to (1, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 3) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4).
   - The program correctly identifies this path and outputs `NO`.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Grid:
     ```
     >><<><
     ><>>><
     ```
   - The robot starts at (1, 1).
   - Moves to (2, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4) -> (2, 5) -> (2, 6).
   - The program correctly identifies this path and outputs `YES`.

#### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotations

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is read and stored.
   - `test_cases` is initialized as an empty list.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, `n`, `row1`, and `row2` are read and stored.
   - `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` are initialized.
   - The loop iterates through each column `j`:
     - Checks if the robot can stay in the first row (`reachable_first_row`).
     - If the arrow points to the right, it checks if it can move to the next column.
     - If the arrow points to the left, it switches to the second row and checks if the arrow points to the right.
     - If the robot is in the second row and the arrow points to the right, it checks if it can move to the next column.
     - The loop updates `reachable_second_row` accordingly.

3. **Final State:**
   - After processing all columns, the final state of `reachable_second_row` is checked.
   - If `reachable_second_row` is `True`, the result is `'YES'`.
   - Otherwise, the result is `'NO'`.

#### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given grid configuration. The annotations and the detailed step-by-step analysis confirm that the program behaves as expected and produces the correct output for all given examples.
