Output State: **reachable_first_row is True if row1[n-1] == '>', otherwise it is False; reachable_second_row is False; the value of j is n - 1; results is ['NO']**

Explanation: The code appends the string 'NO' to the list `results`. This changes the state of the `results` list, adding 'NO' to it. The other variables (`reachable_first_row`, `reachable_second_row`, and `j`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
