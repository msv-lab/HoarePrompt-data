Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in this case is `j`, and it iterates over `range(n)`. This means `j` starts from 0 and goes up to `n-1`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `reachable_first_row` is true.
   - `reachable_second_row` is true.
   - `j` equals `n - 1`.

3. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `j` was `n - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `j` would be `n - 1 + 1 = n`.
   - However, since `j` is iterating over `range(n)`, once `j` reaches `n - 1`, the loop will stop executing because `range(n)` does not include `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we need to adjust its value.
   - Given that `j` was `n - 1` and the loop will stop after this iteration, there are no further changes needed for `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration (which actually won't happen in this case) would be:

State: **`reachable_first_row` is true, `reachable_second_row` is true, `j` is `n`**.

However, since the loop will terminate after this iteration, the final state remains as follows:

State: **`reachable_first_row` is true, `reachable_second_row` is true, `j` is `n - 1`** (since the loop will not proceed further).

So, the final answer is:

State: **`reachable_first_row` is true, `reachable_second_row` is true, `j` is `n - 1`**.
