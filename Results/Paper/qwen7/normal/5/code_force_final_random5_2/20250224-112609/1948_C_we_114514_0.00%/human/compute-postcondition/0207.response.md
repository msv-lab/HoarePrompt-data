Output State: The `results` list will contain either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on whether `reachable_second_row` becomes True for any test case. If `reachable_second_row` becomes True for any test case, the corresponding entry in `results` will be 'YES'; otherwise, it will be 'NO'. The values of `reachable_first_row`, `reachable_second_row`, `n`, and `j` will reflect the final state of the last executed test case, but since the loop processes each test case independently, these values may vary between different entries in the `results` list. The `results` list will have a length equal to the number of test cases in `test_cases`.

In more detail:
- `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` will be set based on the conditions met during the last iteration of the loop for the last test case.
- `n` will be the `n` value of the last test case processed.
- `j` will be `n - 1`, as the inner loop always checks up to `n - 1`.
- `results` will contain one 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, indicating whether `reachable_second_row` was made True for that specific test case.
