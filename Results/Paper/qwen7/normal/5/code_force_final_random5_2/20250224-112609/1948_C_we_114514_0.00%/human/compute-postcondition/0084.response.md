Postcondition: `reachable_first_row` is True or False, `reachable_second_row` is True, `n` must be greater than 0, and `j` is 1. If `row1[j]` (where `j` equals `n - 1`) is '>', then `reachable_first_row` becomes True. Otherwise, `reachable_first_row` remains False while `reachable_second_row` stays True.
