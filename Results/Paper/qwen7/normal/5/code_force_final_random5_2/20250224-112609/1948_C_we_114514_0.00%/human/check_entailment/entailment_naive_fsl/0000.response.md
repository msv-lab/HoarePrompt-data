Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for determining if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) is flawed. Here is a counterexample:

Consider the following input:
```
4
4
<>><
><>>
```

The program's output for this input is `NO`, but according to the problem description, the robot should be able to reach the cell (2, 4) through the following path:
1. Start at (1, 1).
2. Move right to (1, 2).
3. Move left to (1, 1).
4. Move right to (1, 2).
5. Move right to (1, 3).
6. Move right to (1, 4).
7. Move down to (2, 4).

However, the program incorrectly determines that the robot cannot reach (2, 4) because it does not properly account for the possibility of the robot moving back and forth between the two rows. The logic only checks if the current column's arrow points right and if the next column's arrow also points right, which is insufficient for handling all cases, especially when the robot needs to backtrack and move between rows.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) for all potential cases.
