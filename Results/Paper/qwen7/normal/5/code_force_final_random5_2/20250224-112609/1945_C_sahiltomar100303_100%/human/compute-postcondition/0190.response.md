Output State: **`i` is 1 if it was 0, or 0 if it was 1, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftOne` is 5**.

Explanation: The variable `leftOne` is incremented by 1. Initially, `leftOne` was 4, so after executing `leftOne += 1`, its value becomes 5. The values of `i`, `mid`, and `leftZero` remain unchanged based on the initial state provided.
