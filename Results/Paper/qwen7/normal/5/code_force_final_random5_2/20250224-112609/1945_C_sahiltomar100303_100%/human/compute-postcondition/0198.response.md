Output State: **`i` is at least `mid`, `n` is greater than `mid`, and the current value of `s[i]` is '0'; `rightZero` is `rightZero + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `trightZero += 1` increments the value of `trightZero` by 1. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `s[i]`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated state includes `rightZero` being incremented by 1.
