Output State: **`left` is equal to `mid - 2` and must be greater than 0, `leftZero` must be less than `(mid - 1) // 2` and is decreased by 1, `rightZero` must be less than `(n - mid + 3) // 2`, `rightOne` must be less than `(n - mid + 3) // 2`, and at least one of `leftZero < (mid - 1 + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - mid + 1 + 1) // 2` must hold true.**

Explanation: The variable `leftZero` is decremented by 1. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged. Therefore, `leftZero` must now be less than `(mid - 1) // 2` and is decreased by 1 from its original value.
