Output State: **`tleftZero` is 0, `rightZero` is 0, `rightOne` is 0, `right` equals `n + 1`, `tleftOne` is 0, `left` is 0, `trightZero` is 0, `trightOne` is 0, `s` is an input string, `n` is an input integer, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 0, `leftOne` is 0**

Explanation: The line `tleftZero = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `tleftZero`. This does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the values of `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `right`, `tleftOne`, `left`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, `s`, `n`, `mid`, `leftZero`, and `leftOne` remain unchanged from their initial states.
