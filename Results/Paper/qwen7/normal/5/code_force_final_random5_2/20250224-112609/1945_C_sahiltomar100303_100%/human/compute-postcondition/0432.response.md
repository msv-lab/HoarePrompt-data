Postcondition: `left` is 0, `rightZero` remains unchanged, `rightOne` remains unchanged, `leftZero` is either 0, 1, or 2, `leftOne` is either unchanged or increased by 1, `leftMove` remains unchanged, `right` must be less than `n`, `trightZero` is either unchanged or decreased by 1, `trightOne` is either unchanged or decreased by 1, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, and either `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2` must still hold true.
