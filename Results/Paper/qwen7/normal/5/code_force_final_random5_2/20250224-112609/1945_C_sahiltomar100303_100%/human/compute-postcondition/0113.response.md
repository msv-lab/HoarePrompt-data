Output State: **`right` is equal to `right + 1`, and either `tleftZero` is increased by 1 or `trightOne` is decreased by 1, ensuring that `(tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2)` still holds.**

Explanation: The variable `right` is incremented by 1. The condition that either `tleftZero` is increased by 1 or `trightOne` is decreased by 1, while maintaining the inequality `(tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2)`, remains unchanged because the increment of `right` does not affect the logical condition directly.
