Output State: **`t` is an input integer with \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `s` is the string input by the user; `mid` is `n // 2`; `leftZero` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `leftZero` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `s`, or `mid`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
