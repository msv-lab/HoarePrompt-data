Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the optimal position for the road is exactly at the midpoint of the village. Specifically, the program does not properly account for the scenario where the number of houses `n` is odd, and the optimal position for the road is exactly at the midpoint (`n // 2 + 1`). 

For example, consider the input:
```
3
111
```
The expected output is `2`, but the program outputs `0`. This is because the program incorrectly handles the case where the optimal position is exactly at the midpoint, leading to an incorrect result.
