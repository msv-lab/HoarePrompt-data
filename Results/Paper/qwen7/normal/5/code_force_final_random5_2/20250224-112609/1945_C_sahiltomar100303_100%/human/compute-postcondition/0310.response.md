Postcondition: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or 1, `rightZero` is equal to the count of '0's in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to the count of '1's in the same substring, the current value of `right` is `n`, `tleftZero` is less than or equal to `n // 2` or greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `trightZero` is equal to `trightZero - right`, and `trightOne` is equal to `trightOne - (n - right)`**.

This means that after the execution of the if-else block, `left` will be 0, and `leftZero` will be either 0 or 1. The count of '0's in the substring from `mid` to `n-1` is stored in `rightZero`, and `rightOne` is less than or equal to the count of '1's in the same substring. The value of `right` remains `n`. Additionally, `tleftZero` will be less than or equal to `n // 2` or greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, and `trightZero` and `trightOne` are adjusted as per their respective definitions.
