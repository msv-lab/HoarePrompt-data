Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `mid`. The variable `rightZero` will be equal to the total number of zeros in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`, and `trightZero` will also be equal to the total number of zeros in the entire string `s`. Similarly, `rightOne` will be equal to the total number of ones in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`, and `trightOne` will be equal to the total number of ones in the entire string `s`. `tleftZero` will be the cumulative count of zeros seen throughout the loop, and `tleftOne` will be the cumulative count of ones seen throughout the loop. The variable `left` is now set to `mid`.**

In this step, the variable `left` is assigned the value of `mid`. All other variables retain their previous states as described in the initial state.
