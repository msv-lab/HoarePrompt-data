Output State: **`left` is now `left - 1`, `leftZero` is either less than \((left + 1) // 2 - 1\) or still less than \((left + 1) // 2\), `rightOne` is less than \((n - left + 1) // 2\), and `rightZero` is either `rightZero + 1` or remains unchanged; `leftOne` is either `leftOne - 1` or remains unchanged, and `rightOne` is either `rightOne + 1` or remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `left -= 1` decrements the value of `left` by 1. All other conditions and relationships remain the same as they were not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the updated value of `left` is `left - 1`, while the other variables (`leftZero`, `rightOne`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, and `rightOne`) maintain their original conditions or expressions.
