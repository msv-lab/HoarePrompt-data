Output State: `left` is equal to 0, `leftZero` is less than `mid // 2`, `rightZero` is equal to the count of '0's in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`, and `rightOne` is less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `left` will eventually reach 0 because the loop continues as long as `left > 0`. The condition `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2` ensures that `leftZero` will be less than `mid // 2` when `left` becomes 0. The variable `rightZero` will keep increasing by 1 each time a '0' is encountered during the decrement of `left`, until `left` reaches 0. The condition `rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` ensures that `rightOne` will be less than `(n - mid + 1) // 2` when `left` is 0.
