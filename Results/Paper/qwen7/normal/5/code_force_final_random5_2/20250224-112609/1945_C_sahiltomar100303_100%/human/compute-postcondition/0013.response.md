State: **`i` is 0, `mid` must be greater than 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is being initialized to 0 by the `range(mid)` function.
2. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `mid`.
3. For the loop to start executing, `i` must be 0 (the initial value).
4. Additionally, `mid` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` set to 0 and `mid` must be greater than 0.
