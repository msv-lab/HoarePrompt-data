Output State: **`left` is equal to `mid` and `mid` must be greater than 0, `leftZero` must be less than half of `left + 1`, and `rightOne` must be less than half of `n - left + 1`; `leftOne` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `leftOne` is decremented by 1. The conditions for `left`, `mid`, `leftZero`, and `rightOne` remain unchanged from the initial state. The character at position `left - 1` in the string `s` is still not '0'.
