Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(mid):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `mid`.

2. **Understand the Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is either 0 or 1.
   - `mid` is `n // 2`.
   - If `s[i]` is '0', then `leftZero` is 2.
   - Otherwise, `leftOne` is 2.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - The loop will increment `i` by 1 in each iteration.
   - Since `i` is either 0 or 1, the next value of `i` will be 1 if it was 0, or 0 if it was 1.
   - The value of `mid` remains unchanged because it is determined by `n` and does not change within the loop.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its current value (either 0 or 1).
   - `mid` remains the same as it was in the previous iteration.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `i` will be 1 if it was 0, or 0 if it was 1.
- `mid` remains `n // 2`.

State: **`i` is 1 if it was 0, or 0 if it was 1, `mid` is `n // 2`, `leftZero` is 2 if `s[i]` is '0', otherwise `leftOne` is 2.**
