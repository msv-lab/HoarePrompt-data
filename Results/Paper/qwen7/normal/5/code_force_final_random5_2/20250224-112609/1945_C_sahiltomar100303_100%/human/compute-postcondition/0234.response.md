Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Loop Condition
The loop condition is:
\[ \text{left} > 0 \text{ and } (\text{leftZero} < (\text{left} + 1) // 2 \text{ or } \text{rightOne} < (n - \text{left} + 1) // 2) \]

### Step 2: Analyze the States at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `left` is equal to `mid - 1` and must be greater than 0.
- `leftZero` is either equal to `leftZero - 1` and still less than half of `left + 1`, or remains less than half of `left + 1`.
- `rightZero` is either equal to `rightZero + 1` and still less than half of `n - left + 1`, or remains less than half of `n - left + 1`.
- `rightOne` is either increased by 1 or remains less than half of `n - left + 1`.

### Step 3: Determine Which States Need Adjustment
We need to ensure that the loop condition is met for the next iteration. The loop condition has two parts:

1. **Part 1:** `left > 0`
2. **Part 2:** `leftZero < (\text{left} + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - \text{left} + 1) // 2`

#### Part 1: `left > 0`
- From the given state, `left` is equal to `mid - 1` and must be greater than 0.
- This part is already satisfied since `left` is `mid - 1` and `mid` is an integer, making `left` positive.

#### Part 2: `leftZero < (\text{left} + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - \text{left} + 1) // 2`
- We need to ensure that at least one of these conditions holds true for the next iteration.

### Step 4: Adjust the States
- For `leftZero < (\text{left} + 1) // 2` to hold, `leftZero` should be less than half of `left + 1`.
- For `rightOne < (n - \text{left} + 1) // 2` to hold, `rightOne` should be less than half of `n - left + 1`.

Given the possible states of `leftZero` and `rightOne`:
- `leftZero` is either `leftZero - 1` and still less than half of `left + 1`, or remains less than half of `left + 1`.
- `rightZero` is either `rightZero + 1` and still less than half of `n - left + 1`, or remains less than half of `n - left + 1`.
- `rightOne` is either increased by 1 or remains less than half of `n - left + 1`.

To ensure the loop continues, we need to adjust `leftZero` or `rightOne` to satisfy the condition.

### Final Answer
State: **`left` is equal to `mid - 1` and must be greater than 0, `leftZero` is either equal to `leftZero - 1` and still less than half of `left + 1`, or remains less than half of `left + 1`, `rightZero` is either equal to `rightZero + 1` and still less than half of `n - left + 1`, or remains less than half of `n - left + 1`, `rightOne` is either increased by 1 or remains less than half of `n - left + 1`, and at least one of `leftZero < (\text{left} + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - \text{left} + 1) // 2` must hold true.**
