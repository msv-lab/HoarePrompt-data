Output State: **`left` is 0, `leftZero` is either 0 or 1, `rightZero` is equal to the count of '0's in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`, `rightOne` is less than or equal to the count of '1's in the same substring, `right` must be less than `n`, `tleftZero` must be less than `(mid + 2) // 2`, `trightZero` is either equal to `trightZero - 1` or remains the same, and `trightOne` is decreased by 1.**

The code `trightOne -= 1` decreases the value of `trightOne` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously described states.
