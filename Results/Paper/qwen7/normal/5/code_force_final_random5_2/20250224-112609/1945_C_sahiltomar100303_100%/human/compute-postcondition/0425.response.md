Postcondition: **`left` is 0, `rightZero` remains unchanged, `rightOne` remains unchanged, `leftZero` is either 0 or 1, `leftOne` remains unchanged, `leftMove` remains unchanged, `left` is 0, `right` is `mid`, `trightZero` is either unchanged or decreased by 1, `trightOne` is either unchanged or decreased by 1, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, and either `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2` must still hold true.**

This means that after the if-else block executes, `left` will remain 0, and various counters (`rightZero`, `rightOne`, `leftZero`, `leftOne`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`) may change depending on the condition of the if statement. The condition involving `tleftZero` and `trightOne` must still be satisfied as it was before the execution.
