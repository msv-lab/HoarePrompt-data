Output State: **`i` is at least `mid + 1`, `n` is greater than `mid`, `rightOne` is increased by 2.**

Explanation: The variable `rightOne` was already increased by 1 before the execution of the given code snippet. The code `trightOne += 1` increases `rightOne` by 1 again. Therefore, `rightOne` is increased by 2 in total. The other variables (`i` and `n`) remain unchanged as per their initial conditions.
