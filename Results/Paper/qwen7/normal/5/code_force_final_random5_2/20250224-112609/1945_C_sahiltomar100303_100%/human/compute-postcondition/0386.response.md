Output State: **After the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `n - 1`; `rightZero` will count the number of '0's from index `mid` to the end of the string `s`; `rightOne` will count the number of '1's from index `mid` to the end of the string `s`; `left` will be equal to `mid`; `leftMove` will be 0; all other variables (`leftZero`, `leftOne`, `right`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, `t`, and `n`) will remain unchanged from their initial or post-first-three-iterations states.**

This means that the variable `leftMove` has been initialized to 0, while all other variables retain their previous states as described in the initial conditions.
