Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(mid, n):`.
   - The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop starts from `i = mid` and continues as long as `i < n`.
   - After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is at least `mid + 1`.
   - `n` is greater than `mid`.

4. **Loop Body:**
   - If `s[i]` equals '0', then `rightZero` is increased by 1.
   - Otherwise, `rightOne` is increased by 2.

5. **Determine the Next State:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i + 1` must still be within the range `[mid, n)`.
   - Therefore, `i + 1` must be less than `n`.

6. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will be updated to `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
   - The postconditions for `rightZero` and `rightOne` are not directly affected by the loop itself but are updated based on the condition inside the loop. However, since we are asked to focus on the loop head variables, we do not need to adjust these postconditions here.

Given the above reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` will be `i + 1`.
- `n` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is at least `mid + 2`, `n` is greater than `mid`**.
