Postcondition: `left` is greater than 0, `leftZero` is either `(left + 1) // 2 - 1` if `s[left - 1] == '0'` or remains less than \((left + 1) // 2\) if `s[left - 1] != '0'`, `rightOne` is either unchanged or increased by 1, `leftOne` is decreased by 1 if `s[left - 1] != '0'`, and `rightZero` is increased by 1 if `s[left - 1] == '0'`.
