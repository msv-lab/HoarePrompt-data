Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: All instances of '0' in the substring from `mid` to `n-1` have been counted in `leftZero`, and all instances of '1' have been counted in `leftOne`. The variable `left` will be set to 0 once the loop exits, indicating that the left boundary has reached the start of the string. `rightZero` and `rightOne` will represent the counts of '0's and '1's from `left` to `n-1`, respectively. `tleftZero` will be the cumulative count of zeros seen throughout the loop, and `tleftOne` will be the cumulative count of ones. The condition `left > 0 and (leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2)` ensures that the loop continues until these conditions are no longer met. The variable `right` is now set to `mid`.
Code of the loop:
while right < n and (tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right +
    1) // 2):
    if s[right] == '0':
        tleftZero += 1
        trightZero -= 1
    else:
        tleftOne += 1
        trightOne -= 1
    right += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `right` is `right + 1`, `right` must be less than `n`. If `s[right]` is '0', then `tleftZero` is increased by 1 and then decreased by 1, and either `tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2` still holds. If `s[right]` is not '0', then `trightOne` is decreased by 1, and `tleftZero >= (right + 1) // 2` or `trightOne >= (n - right + 1) // 2` still holds.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `right` is equal to `right + 1`, and either `tleftZero` is increased by 1 or `trightOne` is decreased by 1, ensuring that `(tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2)` still holds.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `right` is equal to `right` + 1, `tleftZero` is equal to its previous value plus 1 if `s[right]` is '0', otherwise `trightOne` is decreased by 1, `trightZero` is decreased by 1 if `s[right]` is '0', and `(tleftZero < (right + 1) // 2 or trightOne < (n - right + 1) // 2)` still holds.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
