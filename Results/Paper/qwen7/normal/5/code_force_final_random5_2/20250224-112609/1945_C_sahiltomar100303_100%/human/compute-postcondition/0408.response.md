Output State: **`left` is greater than 0, `rightOne` is less than \((n - left) // 2\), `rightZero` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `rightZero` is incremented by 1. The conditions for `left` and `rightOne` remain the same as they were initially, just with `left - 1` adjusted to `left`. Therefore, `left` is still greater than -1 (which simplifies to being greater than 0), and `rightOne` is still less than \((n - (left - 1) + 1) // 2\), which simplifies to \((n - left) // 2\).
