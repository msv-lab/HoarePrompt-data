Output State: **`left` is now `left - 2`, `leftZero` must be less than \((left + 1) // 2\), and `rightOne` must be less than \((n - left + 1) // 2\); `leftOne` is now `leftOne - 1`, `rightOne` is now `rightOne + 1`.**

Explanation: The code increments `rightOne` by 1. The values of `left`, `leftZero`, and `leftOne` remain as per the initial conditions, but `leftOne` is decremented by 1 and `rightOne` is incremented by 1. The condition for `leftZero` and `rightOne` remains unchanged.
