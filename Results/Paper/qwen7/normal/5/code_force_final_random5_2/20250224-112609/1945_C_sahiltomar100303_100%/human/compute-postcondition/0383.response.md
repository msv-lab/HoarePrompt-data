Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n - 1`. `rightZero` will be incremented by the number of '0's from index `mid` to `n-1`, and `rightOne` will be incremented by the number of '1's from index `mid` to `n-1`.

This means that `rightZero` will contain the total count of '0's in the substring from `mid` to the end of the string `s`, and `rightOne` will contain the total count of '1's in the same substring. All other variables (`leftZero`, `leftOne`, `right`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, `t`, and `n`) will retain their values as they were after the first three iterations of the loop.
