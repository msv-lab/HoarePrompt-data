Output State: **`leftMove` is 0, `left` is equal to `mid`, `rightZero` reflects the count of '0's in the substring from index `mid` to `n-1`, and `rightOne` reflects the count of '1's in the same substring.**

Explanation: The line `leftMove = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `leftMove`. This is the only assignment made, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, `left` remains equal to `mid`, `rightZero` continues to reflect the count of '0's in the specified substring, and `rightOne` continues to reflect the count of '1's in the same substring.
