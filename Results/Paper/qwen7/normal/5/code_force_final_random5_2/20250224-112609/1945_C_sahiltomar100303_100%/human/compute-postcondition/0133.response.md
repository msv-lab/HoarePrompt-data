Postcondition: **`right` equals `n`, `tleftZero` is the total count of zeros encountered during the loop, `tleftOne` is the total count of ones encountered during the loop, `left` is 0, `trightZero` and `trightOne` are both 0, and either `rightOne` is greater than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2` or the condition `(rightOne >= (n + 1) // 2)` is false.**
