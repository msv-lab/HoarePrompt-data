Postcondition: `left` is equal to `mid - 1` and must be greater than 0, `leftZero` is either equal to `leftZero - 1` and still less than half of `left + 1`, or remains less than half of `left + 1`, `rightZero` is either equal to `rightZero + 1` and still less than half of `n - left + 1`, or remains less than half of `n - left + 1`, `rightOne` is either increased by 1 or remains less than half of `n - left + 1`, and at least one of `leftZero < (\text{left} + 1) // 2` or `rightOne < (n - \text{left} + 1) // 2` must hold true.

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts of the if-else block, ensuring that the conditions specified in both parts are met regardless of whether the condition `s[left - 1] == '0'` is true or false.
