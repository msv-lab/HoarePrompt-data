Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n - 1`. `rightZero` will be incremented by the number of '0's in the substring `s[mid:n]`, and `rightOne` will be incremented by the number of '1's in the same substring. All other variables (`leftZero`, `leftOne`, `right`, `trightZero`, `trightOne`, `t`, and `n`) will remain unchanged from their initial or post-first-three-iterations states.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `i` will point to the last index of the string `s`. The variable `rightZero` will count the number of '0's from index `mid` to the end of the string, and `rightOne` will count the number of '1's in the same range.
