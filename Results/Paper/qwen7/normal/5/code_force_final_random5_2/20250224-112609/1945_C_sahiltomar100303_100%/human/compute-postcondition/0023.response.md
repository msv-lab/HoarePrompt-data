Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(mid)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `mid`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `mid`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: 
   - `i` is 0.
   - `mid` is greater than 0.
   - Postcondition: If `s[i]` is '0', then `leftZero` is 2. Otherwise, `leftOne` is 2.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, after the first iteration, `i` will become 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `mid`. Given that `i` becomes 1, `mid` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - `mid` must remain greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

6. **Postcondition for the next iteration**:
   - The postcondition will depend on the value of `s[1]` (since `i` will be 1).
   - If `s[1]` is '0', then `leftZero` will be 2.
   - Otherwise, `leftOne` will be 2.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `mid` must be greater than 1, if `s[1]` is '0', then `leftZero` is 2, otherwise `leftOne` is 2**.
