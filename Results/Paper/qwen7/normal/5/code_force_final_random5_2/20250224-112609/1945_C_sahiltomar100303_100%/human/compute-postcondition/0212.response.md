Output State: **`i` is at least `mid + 2`, `n` is greater than `mid`, `rightZero` is increased by 1.**

The code `rightZero += 1` increments the value of `rightZero` by 1. Since the initial conditions for `i` and `n` remain unchanged, they are still at least `mid + 2` and greater than `mid`, respectively.
