Output State: **`right` is less than `n - 1`, `tleftZero` < (right + 1) // 2 or `trightOne` < (n - right + 1) // 2 still holds, `tleftOne` is increased by 1**.

Explanation: The variable `tleftOne` is incremented by 1. The conditions involving `tleftZero`, `trightOne`, `right`, and `n` must still hold true as per the initial state. Therefore, the updated state includes the increment of `tleftOne` while maintaining the original conditions.
