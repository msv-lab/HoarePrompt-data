Output State: `left` is equal to 0, `leftZero` is less than or equal to 0, `rightZero` is equal to the count of '0's in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`, and `rightOne` is less than or equal to the count of '1's in the same substring.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `left` will eventually reach 0 because the loop continues as long as `left > 0`. The condition `leftZero < (left + 1) // 2 or rightOne < (n - left + 1) // 2` ensures that the loop continues to decrement `left` until `leftZero` is no longer less than half of `left + 1` and `rightOne` is no longer less than half of `n - left + 1`. At this point, `left` will be 0. 

`leftZero` will be reduced by 1 each time a '0' is encountered and incremented by 1 each time a '0' is moved from the right side to the left side. Since `left` will eventually reach 0, `leftZero` will be reduced to a value that is no longer less than half of `left + 1` (which is 1 when `left` is 0). Therefore, `leftZero` will be less than or equal to 0.

`rightZero` will be incremented each time a '0' is moved from the right side to the left side, so it will reflect the count of '0's in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`.

`rightOne` will be incremented each time a '1' is moved from the right side to the left side, but since the loop terminates when `rightOne` is no longer less than half of `n - left + 1`, `rightOne` will be less than or equal to the count of '1's in the substring from `mid` to `n-1`.
