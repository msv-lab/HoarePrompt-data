Based on the initial state provided:

- `left` is explicitly stated to be 0.
- Other variables like `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `rightOne`, `right`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` have conditions or formulas associated with them but do not affect the value of `left`.

The print statement is simply `print(left)`, and since `left` is explicitly given as 0, the output will be:

Output: **0**
