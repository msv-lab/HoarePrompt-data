Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list containing two lists. The first list consists of `n` non-decreasing integers representing the difficulties of initial problems, and the second list consists of `n` non-decreasing integers representing the maximum expected difficulties. After executing the function, it returns a new list of two lists, where both lists contain the original integers in descending order.**
