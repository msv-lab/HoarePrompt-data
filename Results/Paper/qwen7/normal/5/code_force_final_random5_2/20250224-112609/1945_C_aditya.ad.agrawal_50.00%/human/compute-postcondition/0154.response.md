Output State: **`arr` must have at least one less element than before, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is equal to its original value plus 2, `z_r` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `z_r -= 1` decreases the value of `z_r` by 1. The other variables (`arr`, `i`, and `pos`) are not affected by this operation, so their states remain as described in the initial state, with `pos` being increased by 2 from its original value.
