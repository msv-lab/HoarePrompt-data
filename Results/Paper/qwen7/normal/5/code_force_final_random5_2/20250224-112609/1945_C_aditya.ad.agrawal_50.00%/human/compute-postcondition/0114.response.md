Postcondition: **`arr` is a list with at least one element, `i` is the second-to-last element of `arr`, `pos` is equal to `ans`, `o_r` is either 0, -1, or -2, `z_r` is either 0 or 1, `b_d` is recalculated as `abs(n / 2 - pos)`, and either `z_l` is increased by 1 or `o_l` is increased by 1. If the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))` is true, then the postcondition remains unchanged. If the condition is false, the postcondition also remains unchanged since there is no else part.**
