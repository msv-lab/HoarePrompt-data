Output State: **`arr` has at least one less element than before, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is either equal to its original value plus 2 or increased by 1, `z_r` is decreased by 1, `o_l` is increased by 1, `o_r` is decreased by 1, `ans` is equal to `pos`, `b_d` is the absolute value of (`n` / 2 - `pos`).**

Explanation: The code calculates the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `pos` and assigns it to `b_d`. The values of `arr`, `i`, `pos`, `z_r`, `o_l`, `o_r`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their previous states, except that `b_d` is now set to the absolute value of `n / 2 - pos`.
