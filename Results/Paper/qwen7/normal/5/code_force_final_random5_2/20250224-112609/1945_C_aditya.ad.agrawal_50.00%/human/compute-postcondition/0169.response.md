Postcondition: `arr` has at least one less element than before, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 1, `z_r` and `o_r` retain their values from the previous iteration, and `z_l` and `o_l` may either increase or decrease by 1 depending on the value of `i`. If `i` is 0, `z_r` decreases by 1 and `o_l` increases by 1. Otherwise, `o_l` increases by 1 and `o_r` decreases by 1.
