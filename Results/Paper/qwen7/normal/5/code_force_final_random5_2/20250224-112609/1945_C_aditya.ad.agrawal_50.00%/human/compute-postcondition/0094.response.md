Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in arr`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `arr`.

2. **Understand the Current State**: 
   - `arr` is a list with at least one element.
   - `i` is the second last element of `arr`.
   - `pos` is assigned to `ans`.
   - `o_r` is 0.
   - `z_r` is 1.
   - `b_d` is equal to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`.
   - The condition `(o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)))` is true.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` is the second last element of `arr`, the next value of `i` would be the last element of `arr`.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - `i` will now be the last element of `arr`.
   - `arr` remains the same as it is being iterated over.

5. **Check the Condition**:
   - The condition `(o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)))` needs to remain true for the loop to continue. Since `o_r` and `z_r` are constants (`0` and `1` respectively), and `b_d` is derived from `n` and `pos`, these values will not change unless `pos` changes, but `pos` is already assigned to `ans` and does not change within the loop body.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

State: **`arr` is a list with at least one element, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `pos` is assigned to `ans`, `o_r` is 0, `z_r` is 1, `b_d` is equal to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`, and the condition `(o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos)))` is true.**
