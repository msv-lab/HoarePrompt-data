Output State: **`arr` has at least one less element than before, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 1 (new value is pos + 1), `z_r` retains its value from the previous iteration, `o_l` is increased by 1, `o_r` retains its value from the previous iteration, and `ans` retains its value from the previous iteration.**

Explanation: The code increments `o_l` by 1. All other variables retain their values from the previous iteration. Therefore, `o_l` is updated to its previous value plus 1, while `arr`, `i`, `pos`, `z_r`, `o_r`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
