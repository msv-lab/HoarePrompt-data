Postcondition: **`input_string` is a string input by the user, `i` is the last element of the list `arr`, `pos` is 0, `z_r` is equal to `z`, `o_r` is equal to `o`, `b_d` remains unchanged, `ans` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `o_l` is 0, `o` is the count of 1s in the list `arr`, `z_l` is 0. If `o_r` is greater than or equal to half of `(z_r + o_r)`, then `b_d` remains 3; otherwise, `b_d` becomes 30001.**
