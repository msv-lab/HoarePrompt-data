Postcondition: `arr` has at least one less element than before, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is either equal to its original value plus 2 or increased by 1, `z_r` is decreased by 1, `o_l` is increased by 1, `o_r` is decreased by 1, and `ans` is equal to `pos` if the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))` is true. If the condition is false, the same conditions hold as in the if part.
