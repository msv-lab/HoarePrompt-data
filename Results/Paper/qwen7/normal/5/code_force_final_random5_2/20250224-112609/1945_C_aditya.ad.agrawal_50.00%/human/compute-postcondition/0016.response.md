Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is a string entered by the user, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer is a character from `input_string` converted to its ASCII value, `z` is the count of 0s in the list `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in the list `arr`, `z_r` is equal to `z`, `o_r` is equal to `o`, `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 0, `b_d` is 30001, and `(o_r < (z_r + o_r) / 2)` is True.**

The code simply assigns the value 30001 to the variable `b_d`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
