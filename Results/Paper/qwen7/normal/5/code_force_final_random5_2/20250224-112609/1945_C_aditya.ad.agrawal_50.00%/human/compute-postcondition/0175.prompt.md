Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `z_l` is 0, `o_l` is 0, `dist` is `abs(n / 2)`, `ans` is 0, `pos` is 0, `b_d` is either `abs(n / 2)` or 30001 depending on whether `o_r` is greater than or equal to `(z_r + o_r) / 2` or not.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    pos += 1
    if i == 0:
        z_l += 1
        z_r -= 1
    else:
        o_l += 1
        o_r -= 1
    if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(n / 
        2 - pos):
        ans = pos
        b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `arr` must have at least one element; `pos` is either 2 or increased by 1 to `o_l + 1`; `z_r` is decreased by 1 if `i` is 0, otherwise `o_r` is decreased by 1; the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` is true; the condition `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` is true; `b_d` is equal to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`; `ans` is equal to `pos`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `arr` has at least one less element than before, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is either equal to its original value plus 2 or increased by 1, `z_r` is decreased by 1, `o_l` is increased by 1, `o_r` is decreased by 1, and `ans` is equal to `pos` if the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))` is true. If the condition is false, the same conditions hold as in the if part.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `arr` has at least one less element than before, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 1, `z_r` retains its value from the previous iteration, `o_l` may be increased by 1, `o_r` may be decreased by 1, and `ans` is equal to `pos` if the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))` is true; otherwise, these variables retain their values as described in the precondition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
