Output State: **`arr` has at least one less element than before, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `pos` is increased by 1, `z_r` retains its value from the previous iteration, `o_l` retains its value from the previous iteration, `o_r` retains its value from the previous iteration, and `ans` retains its value from the previous iteration.**

This means that the position index `pos` has been incremented by 1, while the other variables (`arr`, `i`, `z_r`, `o_l`, `o_r`, and `ans`) retain their values from the previous iteration.
