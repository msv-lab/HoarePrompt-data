Output State: **`arr` is a list with at least one element, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `pos` is equal to `ans` + 1, `o_r` is either 0 or -1, `z_r` is either 0 or 1, `b_d` is equal to `abs(n / 2 - (ans + 1))`, and `ans` is now equal to `pos`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = pos` updates the value of `ans` to be equal to the current value of `pos`. All other variables remain unchanged.
