Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4. The variable `n` and string `a` remain in their initial state as defined in the precondition.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    n = int(input())
    input_string = input()
    arr = [int(ch) for ch in input_string]
    z = arr.count(0)
    o = arr.count(1)
    z_r = z
    o_r = o
    z_l = 0
    o_l = 0
    dist, ans, pos = abs(n / 2), 0, 0
    if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2:
        b_d = dist
    else:
        b_d = 30001
    for i in arr:
        pos += 1
        if i == 0:
            z_l += 1
            z_r -= 1
        else:
            o_l += 1
            o_r -= 1
        if o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and b_d > abs(
            n / 2 - pos):
            ans = pos
            b_d = abs(n / 2 - pos)
    print(ans)
    t -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is the last element of the list `arr`, `pos` is equal to the length of `arr`, `z_r` is equal to `-z` (since `z` zeros are processed and `z_l` is updated accordingly), `o_r` is equal to `-o` (since `o` ones are processed and `o_l` is updated accordingly), `b_d` remains 3, `ans` is the position where the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` was last satisfied before `pos` reached the length of `arr`, `t` is decreased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `arr` is a list with at least one element, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `pos` is equal to the index where `ans` was last updated, `o_r` is the final count of 1s minus the final count of 0s seen so far, `z_r` is the final count of 0s minus the final count of 1s seen so far, `b_d` is the absolute difference between `n/2` and `pos`, `o_l` and `z_l` are the cumulative counts of 1s and 0s seen throughout the entire execution of the loop, and `t` is `t - 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: All elements in `arr` have been processed, `pos` equals the length of `arr` + 1, `z_l` and `z_r` are both 0, `o_l` equals the total number of 1s in `arr`, `o_r` equals the total number of -1s in `arr`, `b_d` equals `abs(n / 2 - len(arr))`, and `ans` equals the last position where the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and (b_d > abs(n / 2 - pos))` was satisfied, or remains 0 if no such position existed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
