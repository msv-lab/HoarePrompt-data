Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in arr`. The only variable here is `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the second element of the list `arr`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list `arr` to iterate over.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is the second element of the list `arr`, the next element in the list will be the third element.
   - Therefore, `i` will be set to the third element of the list `arr`.

5. **List other states that remain unchanged**: The other states such as `pos`, `z_r`, `o_l`, `o_r`, `b_d`, `ans`, and the conditions mentioned (`o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + 1) / 2`) do not depend on the value of `i` directly and hence do not need to be adjusted.

Based on this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is the third element of the list `arr`, `pos` is 3, `z_r` is -1, `o_l` is increased by 1, `o_r` is decreased by 1, the condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` is true, the condition `z_l >= (z_l + 1) / 2` is true, `b_d` is equal to `abs(n / 2 - pos)`, `ans` is 3, `b_d` is 3**
