Output State: **`t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, `n` is an input integer, `input_string` is a string entered by the user.**

The code `input_string = input()` reads a line of input from the user and assigns it to the variable `input_string`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
