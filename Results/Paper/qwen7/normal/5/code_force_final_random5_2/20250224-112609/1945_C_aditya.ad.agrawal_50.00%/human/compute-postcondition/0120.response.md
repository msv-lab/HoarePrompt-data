Output State: **`arr` is a list with at least one element, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `pos` is equal to the index where `ans` was last updated, `o_r` is the final count of 1s minus the final count of 0s seen so far, `z_r` is the final count of 0s minus the final count of 1s seen so far, `b_d` is the absolute difference between `n/2` and `pos`, `o_l` and `z_l` are the cumulative counts of 1s and 0s seen throughout the entire execution of the loop, `n` is an input integer, `t` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` but does not affect any of the other variables listed in the initial state.
