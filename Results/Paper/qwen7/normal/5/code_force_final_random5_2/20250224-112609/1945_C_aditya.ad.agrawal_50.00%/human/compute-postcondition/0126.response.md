Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `pos` is equal to the index where `ans` was last updated, `o_r` is equal to `o`, `z_r` is equal to `z`, `b_d` is the absolute difference between `n/2` and `pos`, `o_l` and `z_l` are the cumulative counts of 1s and 0s seen throughout the entire execution of the loop, `n` is an input integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `input_string` is the string input by the user, `z` is the count of 0s in the list `arr`, `o` is the count of 1s in the list `arr`.**

Explanation: The line `o_r = o` assigns the current value of `o` (which is the count of 1s in the list `arr`) to `o_r` (final count of 1s minus the final count of 0s seen so far). All other variables remain unchanged.
