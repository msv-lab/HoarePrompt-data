Output State: **`arr` is a list with at least one element, `i` is the second last element of `arr`, `pos` is 1.**

Explanation: Initially, `i` is the last element of `arr`. After executing `pos += 1`, `pos` is incremented by 1, making it 1 (assuming it was 0 before). Consequently, `i` now refers to the second last element of `arr`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
