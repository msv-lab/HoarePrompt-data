### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `num_tests`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `nums`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes `start_year` to 0. This variable is supposed to track the current year when the last sign occurred.

3. **Loop Through Signs:**
   - The program iterates through each sign's periodicity.
   - For each periodicity `nums[x]`, it updates `start_year` using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.

4. **Formula Analysis:**
   - The formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is intended to find the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year`.
   - However, this formula does not correctly handle the sequential waiting period for the signs. It only finds the next multiple of the current periodicity without considering the cumulative effect of previous signs.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of all periodicities. The LCM will give us the smallest year in which all signs will occur sequentially.
   - The given formula does not account for the sequential nature of the signs. Instead, it only considers the periodicity of the current sign without updating the cumulative effect of previous signs.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the year in which all signs will occur sequentially. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
