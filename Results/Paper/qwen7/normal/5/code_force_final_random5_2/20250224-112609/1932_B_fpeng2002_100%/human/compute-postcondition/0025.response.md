Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `start_year` is \((start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]\)
- `x` is `x + 1`

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for x in range(0, len(nums)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Variable `x`**: The loop variable `x` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration. At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is `x + 1`.
2. **Variable `start_year`**: The value of `start_year` is updated based on the current value of `x` in each iteration.

### Determining the Next State
- **For the loop to execute one more time**, `x` must be within the range of `range(0, len(nums))`.
- Given that `x` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `x` will be `x + 1`.

### New Values
- Since `x` is incremented by 1, the new value of `x` will be `x + 1`.
- The new value of `start_year` will depend on the new value of `x`.

### Updated State
- `start_year` will be updated based on the new value of `x` (which is `x + 1`).
- `x` will be `x + 1`.

### Final Answer
State: **`start_year` is \((start_year // nums[x + 1] + 1) * nums[x + 1]\), `x` is `x + 2`**

This means:
- `start_year` is now calculated using `x + 1` instead of `x`.
- `x` is incremented by 1 again, making it `x + 2`.

So, the final state is:
State: **`start_year` is \((start_year // nums[x + 1] + 1) * nums[x + 1]\), `x` is `x + 2`**
