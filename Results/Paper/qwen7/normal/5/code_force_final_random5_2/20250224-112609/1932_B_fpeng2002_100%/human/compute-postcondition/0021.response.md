Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for x in range(0, len(nums)):`. The objects involved here are `x`, `len(nums)`, and `nums`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `x` is the loop variable, which starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - `len(nums)` is the length of the list `nums`.
   - `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `x` is less than `len(nums)`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `len(nums)` is at least 1 (since `x` starts at 0).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `num_tests` is 0 and does not affect the loop execution.
   - `n` is an input integer and does not affect the loop execution.
   - `start_year` is 0 and does not affect the loop execution.
   - `nums` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - `x` will start at 0, but since we are focusing on the initial state before the loop starts, we don't need to specify its value explicitly.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `nums` must have at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`nums` is a list of integers that must have at least one element**
