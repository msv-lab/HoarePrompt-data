Output State: **`num_tests` is an input integer, and the values of `t` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n` remain unchanged from their initial state.**

Explanation: The code reads the number of test cases (`num_tests`) as an input integer. This changes the value of `num_tests`, but it does not affect the values of `t` or the list of integers `a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions specified in the initial state.
