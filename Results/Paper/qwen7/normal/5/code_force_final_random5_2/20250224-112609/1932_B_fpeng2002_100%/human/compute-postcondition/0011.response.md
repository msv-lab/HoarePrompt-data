Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in range(0, len(nums))`.

2. **Determine the current state of the loop variables**:
   - `start_year` is updated to `(start_year // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]`.
   - `nums` is a list of integers.
   - `x` is currently 1.

3. **Understand the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `x` is less than `len(nums)`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `x` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be incremented to 2.
   - Therefore, `x` should be set to 2.
   - The value of `start_year` and `nums` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `start_year` remains the same: `(start_year // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]`.
   - `nums` remains the same: a list of integers.
   - `x` is now 2.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`start_year` is `(start_year // nums[1] + 1) * nums[1]`, `nums` is a list of integers, `x` is 2**
