Output State: **`start_year` is equal to the result of applying the operation `(start_year // len(nums) + 1) * len(nums)` once, `x` is equal to `len(nums) - 1`, `num_tests` is equal to `num_tests - 1`, and `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `n`. The values of `start_year`, `x`, and `num_tests` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `start_year` remains equal to the result of the specified operation, `x` remains equal to `len(nums) - 1`, and `num_tests` is decremented by 1.
