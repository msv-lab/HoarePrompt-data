Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates a value `start_year` by successively applying the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each element in the list `nums`. After processing all test cases, it prints the final value of `start_year` for the last test case.**
