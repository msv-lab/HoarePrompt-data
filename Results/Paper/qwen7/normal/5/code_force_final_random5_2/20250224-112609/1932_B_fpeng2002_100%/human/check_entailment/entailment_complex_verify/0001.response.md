### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the given program and the provided annotations to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `num_tests`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `nums`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `start_year` is initialized to 0. This variable is intended to track the current year when the last sign occurred.

3. **Loop Through Signs:**
   - The program iterates through each sign's periodicity.
   - For each periodicity `nums[x]`, it updates `start_year` using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.

4. **Formula Analysis:**
   - The formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is intended to find the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year`.
   - This formula correctly handles the sequential waiting period for the signs. It ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - The given formula correctly accounts for the sequential nature of the signs. It updates `start_year` to the next multiple of the current periodicity, ensuring that the next sign occurs after the previous one.

6. **Final Year Calculation:**
   - After processing all periodicities for a test case, `start_year` will hold the correct year in which all signs will occur sequentially.
   - The program prints the final value of `start_year` for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic required to find the year in which all signs will occur sequentially. The formula used in the loop ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one, maintaining the sequential order.

### Correctness:
**True**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
