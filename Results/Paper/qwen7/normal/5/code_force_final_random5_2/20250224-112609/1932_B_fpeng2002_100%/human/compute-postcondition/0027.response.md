Output State: `start_year` is equal to the result of applying the formula `(start_year // (len(nums) - 1) + 1) * (len(nums) - 1)` once, with `x` being `len(nums) - 1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `start_year` will be the value it reaches after being updated in the loop body for each index in the `nums` list. The final update will be based on the last index of the `nums` list, making `x` equal to `len(nums) - 1`. The formula updates `start_year` to the nearest multiple of `x + 1` that is greater than or equal to the current `start_year`.
