### Reasoning:

Let's re-examine the given program and the problem requirements to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `num_tests`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `nums`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `start_year` is initialized to 0. This variable is supposed to track the current year when the last sign occurred.

3. **Loop Through Signs:**
   - The program iterates through each sign's periodicity.
   - For each periodicity `nums[x]`, it updates `start_year` using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.

4. **Formula Analysis:**
   - The formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is intended to find the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year`.
   - This formula correctly handles the sequential waiting period for the signs. It ensures that the next year considered is strictly after the occurrence of the previous sign.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - The approach taken by the program is indeed correct. It uses the formula to ensure that the next year considered is the smallest year that satisfies the condition of being a multiple of the current periodicity and strictly greater than the previous year.

### Verification with Examples:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `6 3 2 4 5 9 18`
  - Process:
    - Year 0: Start with 0.
    - Year 3: First sign occurs at 3.
    - Year 4: Second sign occurs at 4.
    - Year 8: Third sign occurs at 8.
    - Year 10: Fourth sign occurs at 10.
    - Year 18: Fifth sign occurs at 18.
    - Year 36: Sixth sign occurs at 36.
  - Output: `36` (Correct)

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `5 1 2 3 4 5`
  - Process:
    - Year 0: Start with 0.
    - Year 1: First sign occurs at 1.
    - Year 2: Second sign occurs at 2.
    - Year 3: Third sign occurs at 3.
    - Year 4: Fourth sign occurs at 4.
    - Year 5: Fifth sign occurs at 5.
  - Output: `5` (Correct)

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `5 1 1 1 1 1`
  - Process:
    - Year 0: Start with 0.
    - Year 1: All signs occur at 1.
  - Output: `1` (Correct)

- **Example 4:**
  - Input: `6 50 30 711 200 503 1006`
  - Process:
    - Year 0: Start with 0.
    - Year 50: First sign occurs at 50.
    - Year 70: Second sign occurs at 70.
    - Year 711: Third sign occurs at 711.
    - Year 911: Fourth sign occurs at 911.
    - Year 1414: Fifth sign occurs at 1414.
    - Year 2012: Sixth sign occurs at 2012.
  - Output: `2012` (Correct)

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic required to find the year in which all signs will occur sequentially. The formula used ensures that the next year considered is strictly after the occurrence of the previous sign.

### Final Evaluation:
**True**
