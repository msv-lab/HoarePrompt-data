Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `start_year` will be equal to the result of applying the operation `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each element in the `nums` list, `x` will be equal to the last index of the `nums` list, `num_tests` will be equal to `num_tests - 3`, and `nums` will be a non-empty list.

In simpler terms, after the loop has completed all its iterations, `start_year` will hold the final value obtained by successively applying the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each element in the `nums` list. The variable `x` will take the value of the last index of the `nums` list. The variable `num_tests` will be reduced by the total number of iterations (which is the number of times the loop was executed). The list `nums` will remain a non-empty list as it is only used within the loop and its state is not changed outside of it.
