Output State: **`num_tests` is greater than 0 - 1, `n` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `start_year` is 0.**

The code simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `start_year`. No other changes are made to the existing variables or their values. Therefore, the values of `num_tests`, `n`, and `nums` remain unchanged, and `start_year` is set to 0.
