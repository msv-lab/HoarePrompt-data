Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x1` is the first integer from the input, `y1` is the second integer from the input, `x2` is the second integer from the input, `y2` is the second integer from the input, `x3` is the first integer from the input split by space, `y3` is the second integer from the input split by space, `x4` is the first integer from the input split by space, `y4` is the second integer from the input split by space, `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.**

Explanation: The code `res = abs(y2 - y1)` calculates the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1` and assigns it to `res`. The values of `a`, `i`, `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `x4`, `y3`, and `y4` remain unchanged. The condition for assigning different values to `res` based on the equality of `x1`, `x2`, `x3`, and `x4` is no longer relevant since the code does not depend on those conditions anymore.
