Output State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an input integer, `y2` is an input integer, `x3` is an input integer, `y3` is an input integer, `x4` is an input integer from the second input, `y4` is an input integer from the second input, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` if `x1` is not equal to `x4` or `x3` is not equal to `x2`. Otherwise, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3` if `x1` equals `x3` and `x2` equals `x4`, and `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` if `x1` equals `x2` and `x3` equals `x4`.**

The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x4` and `y4`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `res` depends on the conditions specified, but those conditions are not evaluated until later in the program.
