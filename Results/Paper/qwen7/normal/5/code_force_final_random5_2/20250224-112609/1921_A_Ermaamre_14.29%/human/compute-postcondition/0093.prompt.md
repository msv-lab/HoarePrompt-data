You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no input parameters. Each testcase consists of four lines, each containing two integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. There are t testcases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())
        
        x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())
        
        x3, y3 = map(int, input().split())
        
        x4, y4 = map(int, input().split())
        
        if x1 == x3 and x2 == x4:
            if y1 < y3:
                res = abs(y3 - y1)
            else:
                res = abs(y1 - y3)
        elif x1 == x2 and x3 == x4:
            if y1 < y2:
                res = abs(y2 - y1)
            else:
                res = abs(y1 - y2)
        elif x1 == x4 and x3 == x2:
            if y1 < y2:
                res = abs(y2 - y1)
            else:
                res = abs(y1 - y2)
        
        print(res ** 2)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will be equal to `a-1`, and `res` will hold the result of the last calculation performed within the loop based on the conditions provided. The values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, and `x4`, `y4` will be those provided by the last set of inputs processed by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function does not accept any parameters. It processes t test cases, where each test case consists of four lines, each containing two integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. The function returns nothing (None).

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
