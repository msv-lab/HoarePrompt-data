Postcondition: `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an integer from the input, `y2` is an integer from the input, `x3` is the first integer from the input, `y3` is the second integer from the input, `x4` is the first integer from the input split by space, `y4` is the second integer from the input split by space, `x1` is not equal to `x3` or `x2` is not equal to `y4`. Additionally, `x1` is equal to `x2` and `x3` is equal to `x4`, and `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2` if `y1` is less than `y2`, otherwise `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.
