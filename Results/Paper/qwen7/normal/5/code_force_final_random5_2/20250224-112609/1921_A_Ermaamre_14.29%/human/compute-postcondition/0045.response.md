Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `a`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i < a`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `x1` is an input integer.
   - `y1` is an input integer.
   - `x2` is an integer from the input.
   - `y2` is an integer from the input.
   - `x3` is the first integer from the input.
   - `y3` is the second integer from the input.
   - `x4` is the first integer from the input split by space.
   - `y4` is the second integer from the input split by space.
   - `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3` if `x1` is equal to `x3` and `x2` is equal to `x4`, otherwise `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1` if `x1` is equal to `x2` and `x3` is equal to `x4`. Otherwise, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop continues as long as `i < a`, after the first iteration, `i` will become 1.
   - `a` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be updated to 1.
   - `a` remains the same (no change needed since no information suggests it should change).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an integer from the input, `y2` is an integer from the input, `x3` is the first integer from the input, `y3` is the second integer from the input, `x4` is the first integer from the input split by space, `y4` is the second integer from the input split by space, and `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y3` if `x1` is equal to `x3` and `x2` is equal to `x4`, otherwise `res` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1` if `x1` is equal to `x2` and `x3` is equal to `x4`. Otherwise, `res` is the absolute difference between `y1` and `y2`.**
