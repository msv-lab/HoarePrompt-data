Postcondition: `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `x1` is an input integer, `y1` is an input integer, `x2` is an integer from the input, `y2` is an integer from the input, `x3` is the first integer from the input, `y3` is the second integer from the input, `x4` is the first integer from the input split by space, `y4` is the second integer from the input split by space. The current value of `x1` is equal to `x3` and the current value of `x2` is equal to `x4`. The current value of `y1` is less than the current value of `y3`.
