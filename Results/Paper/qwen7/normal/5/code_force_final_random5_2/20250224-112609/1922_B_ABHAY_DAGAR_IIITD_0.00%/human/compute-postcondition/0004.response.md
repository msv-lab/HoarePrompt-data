Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The line `num_of_lens = {}` initializes an empty dictionary named `num_of_lens`. The initial state of `results` being an empty list and `num_list` being a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer remains unchanged by this line of code.
