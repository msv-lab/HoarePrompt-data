Output State: `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `res` is the sum of all contributions calculated during the loop based on the conditions given, and `total_count` is the sum of all values that were originally present in `num_of_lens`.

To break it down further:
- `num_of_lens` becomes empty because all keys (integers from `num_list`) that had counts greater than or equal to 3 have been processed, reducing their counts until they are less than 3, and then they are removed from the dictionary.
- `res` accumulates the value based on the formulae `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` and `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` for each `cnt` that meets the respective conditions across all iterations.
- `total_count` increases by the original value of `cnt` for each iteration, which means it sums up all the counts that were initially present in `num_of_lens`.
