Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary containing the key `x` with a value of 1, and `num_list` is a list of integers with at least one element excluding the first element, which is `x`.**

Explanation: The code `num_of_lens[x] = 1` updates the dictionary `num_of_lens` by setting the value of the key `x` to 1. The other variables (`results` and `num_list`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
