Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `res` is the sum of all contributions calculated during the loop based on the conditions given, `total_count` is the sum of all values that were originally present in `num_of_lens`, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from input, `test_cases` is decremented by 1.
Code of the loop:
for x in num_list:
    if x in num_of_lens:
        num_of_lens[x] += 1
    else:
        num_of_lens[x] = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where the key `x` (the first element in `num_list`) either has its count incremented by 1 if it was already present, or is set to 1 if it was not present before. `res` is the sum of all contributions calculated during the loop based on the conditions given, `total_count` is the sum of all values that were originally present in `num_of_lens`, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from input, `x` is an integer in `num_list`, and `test_cases` is decremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1 if `x` was already present, otherwise `num_of_lens[x]` is set to 1. `res` remains unchanged if `x` was already present, otherwise `res` is the sum of all contributions calculated during the loop based on the conditions given. `total_count` remains unchanged. `num_list` and `x` remain unchanged. `test_cases` is decremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1 if `x` was already present, otherwise it is set to 1. `res` remains unchanged if `x` was already present, otherwise `res` is the sum of all contributions calculated during the loop based on the conditions given. `total_count`, `num_list`, and `test_cases` remain unchanged. `x` is the next value in `num_list`. `test_cases` is decremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
