The only variables in the loop head are `x` and `num_list`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x` and `num_list`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is the next integer in `num_list`, and after executing the if-else block, `num_of_lens[x]` is updated accordingly. This means that `x` will be the next integer in `num_list` for the next iteration.

To determine the state for the next iteration, we need to consider that `x` will be the next integer in `num_list`. Since `x` is the next integer, it implies that `x` has already been processed in the current iteration, and the loop will continue with the next integer in `num_list`.

Therefore, for the next iteration, `x` will be the next integer in `num_list`.

State: **`x` is the next integer in `num_list`**
