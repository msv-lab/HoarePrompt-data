Output State: **`x` is an integer, `num_of_lens` is a list of integers with the element at index `x` now being 1**.

The code assigns the value 1 to the element in the list `num_of_lens` at the index specified by the variable `x`. Since `x` was initially an integer not present in the list `num_of_lens`, after executing the code, the list `num_of_lens` will have its `x`-th element set to 1. The value of `x` remains unchanged, and the list `num_of_lens` is updated accordingly.
