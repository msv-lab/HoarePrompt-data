Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for result in results:`. The only variables involved here are `result` and `results`.

2. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - The `result` variable holds the current element from the `results` list.
   - The `results` list remains unchanged as it is the iterable itself.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - In the next iteration, `result` will be set to the next element in the `results` list.
   - The `results` list remains the same.

Given this information, we can conclude that the state needs to be adjusted such that `result` is set to the next element in the `results` list.

### Final Answer:
State: **`result` is the next element in the `results` list**.
