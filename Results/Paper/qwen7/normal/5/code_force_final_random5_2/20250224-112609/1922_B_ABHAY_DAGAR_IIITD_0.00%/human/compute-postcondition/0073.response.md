Output State: **`num_of_lens[x]` is set to 1, `res` remains unchanged, `total_count` remains unchanged, `num_list` remains unchanged, `x` is the next value in `num_list`, `test_cases` is decremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code sets `num_of_lens[x]` to 1 because `x` was not previously present in `num_of_lens`. The values of `res`, `total_count`, `num_list`, `x`, and `test_cases` remain unchanged from their previous states.
