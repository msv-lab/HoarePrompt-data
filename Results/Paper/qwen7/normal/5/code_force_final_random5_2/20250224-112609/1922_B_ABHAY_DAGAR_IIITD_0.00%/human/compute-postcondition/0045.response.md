Output State: **`num_of_lens` must have at least one value, `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens` after being decreased by 2, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `res` by adding the value of `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. Here, `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens` after being decreased by 2. The initial conditions of `num_of_lens` having at least one value and `cnt` being the next value from `num_of_lens` after being decreased by 2 remain unchanged. The only new information is that `res` has been updated according to the given formula.
