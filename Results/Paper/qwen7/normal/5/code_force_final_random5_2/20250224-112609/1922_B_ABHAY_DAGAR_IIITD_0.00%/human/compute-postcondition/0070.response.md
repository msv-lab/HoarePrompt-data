Postcondition: **`num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1 if `x` was already present, otherwise `num_of_lens[x]` is set to 1. `res` remains unchanged if `x` was already present, otherwise `res` is the sum of all contributions calculated during the loop based on the conditions given. `total_count` remains unchanged. `num_list` and `x` remain unchanged. `test_cases` is decremented by 1.**
