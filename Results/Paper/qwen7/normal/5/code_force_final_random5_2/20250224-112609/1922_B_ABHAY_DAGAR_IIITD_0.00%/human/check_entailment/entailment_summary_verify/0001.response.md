### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to count the number of ways to choose 3 sticks such that they can form a non-degenerate triangle.
   - The triangle inequality rule states that for three lengths \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) (where \(a \leq b \leq c\)), they can form a triangle if and only if \(a + b > c\).

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It counts the occurrences of each unique stick length using `num_of_lens`.
   - The logic to calculate the number of valid triangles is indeed flawed. The current approach attempts to use combinations but does not properly check the triangle inequality rule.
   - The formula used to calculate combinations assumes all sticks are of the same type, which is incorrect.

3. **Function Summary**:
   - The function `func_1` processes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer \( n \) (representing the number of sticks) followed by \( n \) integers (exponents). For each tuple, it calculates a sum based on the frequency of each exponent and stores the result in a list. Finally, it prints each result from the list.
   - This summary is incorrect because the function does not actually process a list of tuples as described. Instead, it processes individual test cases directly.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - For each unique stick length, we need to ensure that the counts of the three different lengths satisfy the triangle inequality.
   - We should use combinations to count valid sets of three sticks, ensuring the triangle inequality holds.

5. **Verification**:
   - Let's verify the code step-by-step:
     - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
     - It counts the occurrences of each unique stick length using `num_of_lens`.
     - However, the logic to calculate the number of valid triangles is incorrect. The current approach does not properly check the triangle inequality rule.
     - The formula used to calculate combinations assumes all sticks are of the same type, which is incorrect.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Test Case 1**: 
  - Input: `7 1 1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - Expected Output: `35`
  - The code will count the number of ways to choose 3 sticks out of 7, which is \(\binom{7}{3} = 35\). However, it does not check the triangle inequality rule.

- **Test Case 2**: 
  - Input: `4 3 2 1 3`
  - Expected Output: `2`
  - The code will count the number of ways to choose 3 sticks out of the given lengths, but it does not check the triangle inequality rule.

- **Test Case 3**: 
  - Input: `3 1 2 3`
  - Expected Output: `0`
  - The code will count the number of ways to choose 3 sticks out of the given lengths, but it does not check the triangle inequality rule.

- **Test Case 4**: 
  - Input: `1 1`
  - Expected Output: `0`
  - The code will count the number of ways to choose 3 sticks out of 1, which is 0. However, it does not check the triangle inequality rule.

### Conclusion:

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to check the triangle inequality and count valid combinations. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
