Output State: The `results` list will contain the sum of `res` values calculated for each test case. For each test case, `num_of_lens` will be a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in the corresponding `num_list`. The `total_count` will be the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` for that test case. The `res` variable will hold the cumulative sum of contributions calculated according to the conditions given for each test case. `n` and `test_cases` will remain as they were initialized, and `num_list` will be an empty list for each test case.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the `results` list will contain one element for each test case, where each element represents the final value of `res` for that specific test case. The `num_of_lens` dictionary will store the frequency of numbers in the input lists for each test case, and `total_count` will be the sum of these frequencies. The `res` variable will accumulate the result based on the given conditions over all test cases.
