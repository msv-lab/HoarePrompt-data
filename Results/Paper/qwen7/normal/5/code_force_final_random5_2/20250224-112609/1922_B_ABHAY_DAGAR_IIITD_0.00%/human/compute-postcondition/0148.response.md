Output State: **`total_count` is `cnt` + 0, `num_of_lens` must contain at least one key-value pair minus one, `res` is now `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) * (`cnt` - 2) // 6 + `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) // 2 * `total_count`, `num_list` remains an empty list, `test_cases` remains 0, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`, and `n` is the input integer that was provided initially.**

Explanation: The code `res += cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` adds the value `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` to the current value of `res`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The updated value of `res` is the sum of its original value and the new addition.
