Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- The for loop iterates over the `results` list.
- The loop body is omitted.
- We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop is iterating over `results` using a variable named `result`.
   - The loop head includes the variable `result`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop continues as long as there are more elements in the `results` list.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `result` would have been set to the current element in the `results` list.

3. **Update the State:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over the `results` list, the next element in the list will be assigned to `result` in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, the `result` variable will be updated to the next element in the `results` list.

### Conclusion:
- The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `result`, which will be set to the next element in the `results` list.

### Final Answer:
State: **`result` is the next element in the `results` list**
