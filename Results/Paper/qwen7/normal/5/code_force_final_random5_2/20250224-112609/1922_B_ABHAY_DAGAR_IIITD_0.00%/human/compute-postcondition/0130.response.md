Output State: **`x` is the next integer in `num_list`; `num_of_lens[x]` is 1**

Explanation: The code assigns the value 1 to `num_of_lens[x]`. Since `x` is the next integer in `num_list`, the only change is that `num_of_lens[x]` is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
