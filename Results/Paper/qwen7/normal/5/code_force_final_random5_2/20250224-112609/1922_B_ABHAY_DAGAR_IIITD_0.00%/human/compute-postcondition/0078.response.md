Output State: **`res` is 0, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each integer in the original `num_list`, `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`, `num_list` is an empty list, and `test_cases` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code initializes `res` to 0.
- The variables `num_of_lens`, `total_count`, `num_list`, and `test_cases` are not directly affected by this line of code.
- `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that contains the frequency of each integer in the original `num_list`.
- `total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`.
- `num_list` is an empty list because it was modified within the loop by decrementing `test_cases` until it reaches 0, making the loop terminate.
- `test_cases` is 0 as it gets decremented by 1 with each iteration until it runs out of elements in `num_list`.
- `res` remains 0 as no addition or subtraction operation is performed on it in the given code snippet.
