Output State: **`x` is the next integer in `num_list`, `num_of_lens[x]` is set to 1.**

Explanation: The code `num_of_lens[x] = 1` sets the value of `num_of_lens[x]` to 1. This means that if `x` was not previously in `num_of_lens`, it is now added with a count of 1. If `x` was already in `num_of_lens`, its count is not changed because the assignment directly sets it to 1. The initial conditions for `x` being the next integer in `num_list` and the update rule for `num_of_lens` are preserved.
