Postcondition: **`total_count` is `cnt` + 0, `num_of_lens` must contain at least one key-value pair minus one, `res` is now `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) * (`cnt` - 2) // 6 + `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) // 2 * `total_count`, `num_list` remains an empty list, `test_cases` remains 0, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`, and `n` is the input integer that was provided initially.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition `cnt >= 3` is true or false (since there is no else part), the values of `total_count`, `num_of_lens`, `res`, `num_list`, `test_cases`, `results`, and `n` remain as specified in the if part, because the else part does not change these values.
