Output State: **`total_count` is 0, `num_of_lens` contains the frequency of each integer in `num_list`, `res` is 0, `num_list` remains an empty list, `test_cases` remains 0, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res`, and `n` is the input integer that was provided initially.**

The code `total_count = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `total_count`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
