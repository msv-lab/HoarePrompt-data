Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to count the number of ways to choose 3 sticks such that they can form a non-degenerate triangle.
2. **Triangle Inequality Rule**: For three lengths to form a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.
3. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It counts the occurrences of each unique stick length using `num_of_lens`.
   - The logic to calculate the number of valid triangles is flawed.
     - The current approach attempts to use combinations but does not properly check the triangle inequality rule.
     - The formula used to calculate combinations assumes all sticks are of the same type, which is incorrect.
4. **Correct Approach**:
   - For each unique stick length, we need to ensure that the counts of the three different lengths satisfy the triangle inequality.
   - We should use combinations to count valid sets of three sticks, ensuring the triangle inequality holds.
5. **Verification**:
   - The provided examples do not match the expected output, indicating an error in the logic.
   - The code does not correctly implement the triangle inequality check.

Given the analysis, the provided code is incorrect because it does not properly implement the logic to check the triangle inequality and count valid combinations.

Correctness: **False**
