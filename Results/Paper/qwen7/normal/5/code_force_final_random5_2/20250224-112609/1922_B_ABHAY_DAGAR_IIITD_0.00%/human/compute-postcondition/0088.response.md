Output State: **`res` is `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6 + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair, `total_count` is 0, `num_list` is an empty list, and `test_cases` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `res += cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` updates the value of `res` by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to its current value. Since `total_count` is 0, the term `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` evaluates to 0. Therefore, `res` remains unchanged from its initial value, which is `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`. All other variables (`num_of_lens`, `total_count`, `num_list`, and `test_cases`) remain unchanged as well.
