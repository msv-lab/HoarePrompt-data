Output State: **`total_count` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens`, `num_of_lens` contains the frequency of each integer in `num_list`, `res` is the cumulative sum of `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) * (`cnt` - 2) // 6 for all `cnt` >= 3, plus `cnt` * (`cnt` - 1) // 2 * `total_count` for all `cnt` >= 2, `num_list` remains an empty list, `test_cases` remains 0, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res` appended with the current value of `res`, and `n` is the input integer that was provided initially.**

Explanation: The line `results.append(res)` appends the current value of `res` to the list `results`. This does not change the values of `total_count`, `num_of_lens`, `res`, `num_list`, `test_cases`, or `n`. Therefore, these variables remain in their initial states except that `results` now contains the value of `res` appended to its existing list.
