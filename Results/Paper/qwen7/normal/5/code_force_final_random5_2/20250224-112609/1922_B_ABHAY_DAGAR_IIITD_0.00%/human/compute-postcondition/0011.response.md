Postcondition: `results` is an empty list, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary containing the key `x` with a value that is either 1 (if `x` is not previously in `num_of_lens`) or 1 more than its original value (if `x` was already in `num_of_lens`), and `num_list` is a list of integers with at least one element where `x` is the first element.
