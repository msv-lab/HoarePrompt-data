Output State: **`num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1, `res` is the sum of all contributions calculated during the loop based on the conditions given, `total_count` is the sum of all values that were originally present in `num_of_lens`, `num_list` is a list of integers obtained from input, `x` is the first element in `num_list`, `test_cases` is decremented by 1, and `x` is in `num_of_lens`.**

This means that the value of `num_of_lens[x]` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
