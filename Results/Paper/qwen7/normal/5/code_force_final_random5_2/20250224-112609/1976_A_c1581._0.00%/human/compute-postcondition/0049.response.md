Output State: **The program returns 'NO'**

This means that after the loop has executed for as many times as there are characters in the password, the function will return 'NO' if a non-digit character is encountered after `last_digit_index` has been set to a positive value. The value of `i` being equal to the length of the password indicates that the loop has completed its iterations. The return statement directly specifies that the function returns 'NO', regardless of the values of other variables like `last_digit_index` or the contents of the `digits` list.
