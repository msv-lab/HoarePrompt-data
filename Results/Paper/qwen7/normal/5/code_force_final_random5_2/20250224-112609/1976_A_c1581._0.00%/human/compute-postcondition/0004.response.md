Output State: **`password` is a non-empty string of length between 1 and 20, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `char` is the first character of `password`, and `digits` is a list containing the digit `char`.**

Explanation: The code appends the first character of the `password`, which is a digit, to the list `digits`. Since `char` is explicitly stated to be a digit and is the first character of `password`, `digits` now contains this digit. All other variables remain in their initial state.
