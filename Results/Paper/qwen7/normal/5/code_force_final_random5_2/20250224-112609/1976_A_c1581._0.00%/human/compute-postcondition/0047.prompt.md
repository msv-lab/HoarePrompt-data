Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `last_digit_index` is -1, `password` is an empty string, `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the original `password`, and `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the original `password`.
Code of the loop:
for i, char in enumerate(password):
    if char.isdigit():
        last_digit_index = i
    elif last_digit_index != -1:
        return 'NO'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `last_digit_index` is either 1 if the first character of `password` is a digit, or -1 if it is not. `i` is 2 if the first character is a digit, and 1 if it is not. `char` is the second character of `password` if the first character is not a digit, and the first character of `password` if it is a digit.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `last_digit_index` is either 3 if the first character of `password` is a digit, or 2 if it is not, `i` is 3 if the first character is a digit, and 2 if it is not, `char` is the third character of `password` if the first character is a digit, and the second character of `password` if it is not, and if the character is not a digit, the function returns 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `last_digit_index` is either 3 or 2, `i` is 4 if the first character is a digit, and 3 if it is not. If the first character is a digit, `last_digit_index` is 4 and `i` is 4. If the first character is not a digit, the function returns 'NO'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
