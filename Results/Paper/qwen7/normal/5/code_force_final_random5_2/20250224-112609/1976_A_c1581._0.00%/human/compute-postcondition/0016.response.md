Output State: **`char` is the next character in the `password` string, `password` is a non-empty string of length between 1 and 20, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits; `digits` is a list containing one additional element which is `char`.**

Explanation: The code appends the `char` to the `digits` list. Since `char` is the next character in the `password` string, and `password` is a non-empty string of length between 1 and 20, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, the `digits` list now contains one more element, which is `char`. All other variables remain in their initial state.
