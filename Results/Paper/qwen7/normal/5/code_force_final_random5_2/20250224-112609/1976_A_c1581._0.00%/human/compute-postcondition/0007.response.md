Output State: **`password` is a non-empty string of length between 1 and 20, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, and the first character of `password` is a lowercase Latin letter; `letters` is a list with one additional element `char`.**

The code appends `char` to the list `letters`. Since `password` was initially a non-empty string of length between 1 and 20, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, and the first character of `password` is a lowercase Latin letter, these properties remain unchanged. The only new information is that `letters` now contains one more element, which is `char`.
