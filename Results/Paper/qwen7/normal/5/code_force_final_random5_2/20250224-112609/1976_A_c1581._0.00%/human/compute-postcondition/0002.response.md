Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `char`, which is used to iterate over each character in the `password`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop head variables**:
   - `char` is the variable that will take on each character from the `password` one by one.
   - `password` is a string of length between 1 and 20, inclusive, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.

3. **Determine the initial value of `char`**:
   - Since the loop will start with the first character of `password`, `char` should initially be set to the first character of `password`.

4. **Ensure the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `password` must contain at least one character. Therefore, `password` must not be an empty string.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `password` must be a non-empty string (length between 1 and 20).
   - `char` must be the first character of `password`.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are:

State: **`password` is a non-empty string of length between 1 and 20, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `char` is the first character of `password`**.
