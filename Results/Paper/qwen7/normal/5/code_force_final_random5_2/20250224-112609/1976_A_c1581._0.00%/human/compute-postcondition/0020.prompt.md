Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: password is a string of length between 1 and 20, inclusive, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits; digits is an empty list; letters is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for char in password:
    if char.isdigit():
        digits.append(char)
    else:
        letters.append(char)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `password` is a non-empty string of length between 1 and 20, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. If the first character of `password` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing that digit. Otherwise, `password` starts with a lowercase Latin letter, and `letters` is a list with one additional element being that letter.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `char` is the next character in the `password` string, `password` is a non-empty string of length between 1 and 20, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. If the first character of `password` was a digit, `digits` is a list containing that digit plus the appended `char`. Otherwise, `letters` is a list with one additional element being that letter plus the appended `char`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `char` is the next character in the `password` string, `password` is a non-empty string of length between 1 and 20, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits; `digits` is a list containing one additional element which is `char` if `char` is a digit, otherwise `letters` is a list with one additional element, which is `char`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
