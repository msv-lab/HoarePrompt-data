Let's break down the solution step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list called `data`.
   - It then iterates over the test cases, extracting the necessary information for each case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it extracts the length of the password (`n`) and the password itself.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` to check if the password meets the criteria.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks two main conditions:
     1. **Digits and Letters Separation**:
        - It separates digits and letters into two lists.
        - It ensures that there are no digits coming after a letter by checking the indices where digits appear.
     - **Sorting Conditions**:
        - It checks if the digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Detailed Verification

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The code correctly reads all input at once and processes it in chunks for each test case.
   - This part is correct and handles multiple test cases efficiently.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The extraction of `n` and `password` is correct.
   - The call to `func_1` is also correct.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Digits and Letters Separation**:
     - The logic for separating digits and letters is correct.
     - The check for no digits after a letter is implemented by ensuring that the last digit index is before any letter.
   - **Sorting Conditions**:
     - The check for sorted digits and letters is done using the `sorted()` function, which is correct.

### Edge Cases and Special Considerations

- **Empty Password**: The code does not handle empty passwords explicitly, but since the problem constraints state \(1 \leq n \leq 20\), an empty password is not possible.
- **Single Character Passwords**: The code will handle these correctly as it checks both digits and letters separately.
- **Mixed Passwords**: The code correctly handles mixed passwords by ensuring that digits come before letters and that both groups are sorted.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code, we can confirm that it correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
