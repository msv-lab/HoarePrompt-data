Output State: **`char` is the next character in the password string, `password` is a non-empty string of length between 1 and 20, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, if the first character of `password` was a digit, `digits` is a list containing that digit plus the appended `char`, otherwise `letters` is a list with one additional element being that letter plus the appended `char`.**

Explanation: The code appends the `char` to the `digits` list if the first character of `password` was a digit, otherwise it appends `char` to the `letters` list. Since the initial state specifies the conditions under which `digits` or `letters` is populated, appending `char` to the appropriate list maintains these conditions.
