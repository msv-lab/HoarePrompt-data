Output State: **The program returns a list `nums` where the first element is `nums[0] + k`, and all other elements `nums[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`) are equal to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`, with `k` being less than or equal to 0.**

Given that `k` is less than or equal to 0, `nums[0] + k` will be less than or equal to `nums[0]`. Since `nums[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n-1` is defined as `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`, and `k` is less than or equal to 0, `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` will be `k` because `k` is smaller than `nums[0] + 1`.

Therefore, the list `nums` will have its first element as `nums[0] + k` and all other elements as `k`.
