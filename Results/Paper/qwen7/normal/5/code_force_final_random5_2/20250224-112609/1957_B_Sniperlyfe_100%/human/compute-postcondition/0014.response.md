Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive), so the loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `k` is updated to `k - (min(nums[0] + 1, k) + nums[i])`.
   - `nums[i]` is set to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time it runs, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `3`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than `3`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be `3`.
   - `n` must be greater than `3`.
   - The values of `k` and `nums[i]` are updated inside the loop body but are not specified to change for the next iteration based on the given information.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**.
