You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
    nums[0] += k
    return nums



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and k are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `k` will be less than or equal to 0, and `nums` will be a list where the first element `nums[0]` is equal to `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`, and all other elements `nums[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`) will be equal to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` as long as `k > 0`. If `k` becomes 0 or negative before the loop completes, the remaining elements in `nums` will be 0.
    nums[0] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list `nums` where the first element is `nums[0] + k`, and all other elements `nums[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`) are equal to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`, with `k` being less than or equal to 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. It initializes a list `nums` of size `n` with all elements set to 0. It then sets the first element `nums[0]` to `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1` and adjusts `k` accordingly. For each subsequent element in `nums`, it assigns the value of `min(nums[0] + 1, k)` while decrementing `k`. After the loop, if `k` is still positive, it adds the remaining value of `k` to `nums[0]`. Finally, it returns the list `nums` where the first element is `nums[0] + k`, and all other elements are `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`, with `k` guaranteed to be less than or equal to 0.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence for certain inputs. For example, consider the input `n=2` and `k=2`. The expected output should be `[2, 0]` because `2 | 0 = 2` in binary is `10`, which has only one 1. However, the program outputs `[1, 1]` because it sets `nums[0]` to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which for `k=2` gives `1`, and then tries to distribute the remaining value of `k` among subsequent elements. This approach does not always maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence.
