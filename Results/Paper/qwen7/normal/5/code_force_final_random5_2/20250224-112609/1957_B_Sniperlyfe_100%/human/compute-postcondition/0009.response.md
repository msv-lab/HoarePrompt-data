Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive), as specified by `range(1, n)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `k` is now `k - min(nums[0] + 1, k)`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `2`.
   - Since `i` starts from `1` and goes up to `n-1`, `n` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented to `2`.
   - `n` remains the same and must still be at least `2`.
   - The value of `k` does not change within the loop head; it changes inside the loop body but is not directly affected by the loop itself.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, and `k` is now `k - min(nums[0] + 1, k)`**.
