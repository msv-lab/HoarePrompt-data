Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(", ")", `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is `n-1`, and `d` is a sorted list of tuples from the original dictionary `d` based on the second element of each tuple in ascending order, with the last element of the tuple negated.**

Explanation: The code sorts the items of the dictionary `d` based on the second element of each tuple in ascending order, and if there are ties, it uses the negative of the first element of the tuple to break the tie. The sorting is done in-place, meaning the dictionary `d` itself is modified. The other variables (`s`, `n`, `i`) remain unchanged.
