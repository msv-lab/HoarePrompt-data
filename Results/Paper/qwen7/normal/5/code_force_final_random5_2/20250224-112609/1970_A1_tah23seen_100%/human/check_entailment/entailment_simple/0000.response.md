Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input string `s` and passes it to the function `func_1`.
2. Inside `func_1`, the dictionary `d` is used to store the balance at each position in the string `s`.
3. The dictionary `d` is then sorted based on the balance values in ascending order and positions in descending order.
4. The sorted indices are used to construct the balanced shuffle sequence `ans` by concatenating characters from the original string `s` at these positions.
5. However, the implementation of `func_1` has a few issues:
   - The dictionary `d` is cleared using `d.pop(n)` after calculating the balances, which is unnecessary and incorrect.
   - The sorting step is done on `d.items()` but `d` is then emptied, leading to an incorrect final result.
   - The logic to construct the balanced shuffle sequence should directly use the sorted indices without clearing the dictionary.

Given these points, the current implementation does not correctly perform the balanced shuffle operation as described.

Correctness: **False**
