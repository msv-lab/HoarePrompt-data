You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program: 
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans



- Annotated Code: 
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")". The string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
        
    #State: Output State: The final output state after the loop executes all iterations is such that `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(", ")", `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is `n-1`, and `d[n]` is the net balance of parentheses in the string `s`. This net balance is calculated as follows: starting from `d[0] = 0`, for each character in `s`, if it is "(", `d` is incremented by 1, and if it is ")", `d` is decremented by 1. Therefore, `d[n]` will be the difference between the number of "(" and ")" in the string `s`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, `d[n]` will be the final value of the depth counter after processing all characters in `s`, indicating how unbalanced the parentheses are in the string. If `d[n]` is positive, there are more "(" than ")". If `d[n]` is negative, there are more ")" than "(". If `d[n]` is zero, the parentheses in `s` are balanced.
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State: `d` is an empty list, `i` is -1, and `ans` is the concatenation of all characters from the string `s` as per the indices specified by the tuples in the original `d`.
    return ans
    #The program returns an empty string since the list 'd' is empty and there are no indices to concatenate characters from the string 's'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads a string `s` from the input.
   - It then calls the function `func_1(s)` and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function takes a string `s` as input.
   - It initializes an empty string `ans` to store the result.
   - It uses a dictionary `d` to keep track of the balance at each position in the string.
     - `d[0]` is initialized to 0.
     - For each character in the string, it updates the balance in the dictionary.
       - If the character is '(', the balance increases by 1.
       - If the character is ')', the balance decreases by 1.
   - After processing all characters, it removes the entry for the length of the string (`d.pop(n)`).
   - It sorts the dictionary items based on the balance (`x[1]`) in ascending order and position (`-x[0]`) in descending order.
   - It constructs the result string `ans` by concatenating the characters at the sorted positions.
   - Finally, it returns the result string `ans`.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Balance Calculation:**
   - The balance calculation is correct. The dictionary `d` keeps track of the balance at each position accurately.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The sorting logic is correct. It sorts the keys of the dictionary based on the balance in ascending order and position in descending order.

3. **Result Construction:**
   - The result string `ans` is constructed by concatenating the characters at the sorted positions. This ensures that the resulting string maintains the correct balance and order as required by the balanced shuffle operation.

### Example Walkthrough:

Given the input `(()(()))`:
- Balance calculation:
  ```
  Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3
  Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6
  Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )
  ```
- Sorting:
  ```
  Sorted keys| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6
  Sorted characters| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )
  Result| ()(()())
  ```

The output matches the expected result `()(()())`.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
