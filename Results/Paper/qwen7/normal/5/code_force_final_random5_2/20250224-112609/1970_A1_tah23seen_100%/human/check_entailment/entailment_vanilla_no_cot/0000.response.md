Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Sorting Key**: The sorting key should consider the balance of the prefix and the position in descending order. However, the current implementation sorts based on the balance and then the negative position, which means it's sorting in ascending order of balance and descending order of position. This needs to be corrected to sort in increasing order of balance and decreasing order of position.

2. **Dictionary Initialization and Usage**: The dictionary `d` is initialized with an entry at index 0, but the keys in the dictionary are indices starting from 1 (`i + 1`). This can lead to confusion and potential errors. It would be better to initialize the dictionary starting from 0.

3. **Removing Last Element**: The line `d.pop(n)` is unnecessary and incorrect because `n` is the length of the string, and you should not remove any elements from the dictionary.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {0: 0}  # Initialize with 0:0 to handle the balance at index 0
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))  # Correct sorting key
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans
```

This corrected version ensures that the dictionary keys start from 0, and the sorting key correctly handles the balance and position as required.
