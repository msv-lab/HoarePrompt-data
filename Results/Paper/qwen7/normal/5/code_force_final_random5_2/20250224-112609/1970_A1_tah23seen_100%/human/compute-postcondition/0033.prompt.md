Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(", ")", `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is `n-1`, and `d` is a sorted list of tuples from the original dictionary `d` based on the second element of each tuple in ascending order, with the last element of the tuple negated.
Code of the loop:
for i, j in d:
    ans += s[i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `d` is a sorted list of tuples from the original dictionary `d` based on the second element of each tuple in ascending order, with the last element of the tuple negated, and must contain at least one tuple; `ans` is equal to `ans` plus the value of `s[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `d` is a sorted list of tuples from the original dictionary `d` based on the second element of each tuple in ascending order, with the last element of the tuple negated, and must contain at least one tuple; `i` is the first element of the next tuple in `d`, `j` is the second element of the next tuple in `d`; `ans` is `ans` plus the value of `s[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ans` is `ans` plus the character at index `i` from the string `s`, `d` remains a sorted list of tuples from the original dictionary `d` based on the second element of each tuple in ascending order with the last element of the tuple negated, `i` is the first element of the next tuple in `d`, `j` is the second element of the next tuple in `d`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
