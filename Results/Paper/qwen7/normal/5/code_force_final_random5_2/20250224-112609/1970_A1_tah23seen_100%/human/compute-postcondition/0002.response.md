Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is an empty dictionary.**

The code creates an empty dictionary `d`, which does not affect the values of `s`, `n`, or `ans`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
