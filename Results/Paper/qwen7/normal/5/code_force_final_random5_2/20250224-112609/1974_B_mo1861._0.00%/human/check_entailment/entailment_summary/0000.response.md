Reasoning:
1. The provided program correctly implements the decoding logic based on the given problem description.
2. In `func_1`, the function first creates a dictionary `char_map` where each unique character in the encoded string `b` is mapped to its corresponding character in the reverse alphabetical order.
3. For each character in `b`, it retrieves the mapped character from `char_map` and appends it to the result string `s`.
4. The execution summary mentions that the function sets an integer `i` to the length of `b`, which is used to create the reverse mapping in `char_map`.
5. The provided examples in the execution summary show that the program correctly decodes the encoded strings back to their original forms.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
