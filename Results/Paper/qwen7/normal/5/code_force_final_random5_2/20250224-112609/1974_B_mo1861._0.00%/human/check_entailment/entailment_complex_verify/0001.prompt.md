You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

    #State: Output State: `b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character in `b` maps to the character 'a', `i` is 1, and `char_map[c]` is 'a'.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates over each unique character in the sorted form of `b`, assigning a new value to `char_map[c]` based on the formula `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`. Since the loop runs for each unique character and `i` starts from 0, the last character in the sorted unique list will map to 'a' (since `len(b) - i - 1` would be 0 for the last character). As the loop progresses, each character will map to a letter starting from 'z' and decreasing until it reaches 'a'. Given that the loop processes each unique character exactly once, all unique characters in `b` will map to 'a' in the final state.
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
        
    #State: Output State: `b` must contain at least one character, `i` is equal to the length of `b`, `s` is a string composed of the characters corresponding to each character in `b` from the `char_map`.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of the string `b`, as it increments by 1 in each iteration. The variable `s` will be a concatenation of all the characters mapped to 'a' in `b` according to the `char_map`.
    return s
    #The program returns a string `s` which is composed of characters corresponding to each character 'a' in string `b` from the `char_map`, and the length of `b` is stored in `i`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `b` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string `s`. Each character in `b` is mapped to 'a' using a predefined mapping scheme, resulting in `s`. Additionally, the function sets an integer `i` to the length of `b`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly decodes the encoded string \( b \) back to the original string \( s \).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string \( b \) and the encoded string itself.

2. **Character Mapping Construction:**
   - In the `func_1` function, a dictionary `char_map` is created to map each unique character in the encoded string \( b \) to its corresponding character in the auxiliary string \( r \).
   - The characters in \( b \) are sorted and iterated over.
   - For each character \( c \) in the sorted set of \( b \), the corresponding character in \( r \) is calculated as the character at position \( len(b) - i - 1 \) in the alphabetically ordered set of unique characters of \( b \).

3. **Decoding Process:**
   - A new string \( s \) is constructed by replacing each character in \( b \) with its mapped character from `char_map`.

### Verification of Correctness:

1. **Mapping Construction:**
   - The mapping is constructed such that the first character in the sorted unique set of \( b \) maps to the last character in the alphabetically ordered set, the second character maps to the second last, and so on.
   - This ensures that the reverse process of encoding is followed accurately.

2. **Decoding Logic:**
   - The decoding logic correctly reverses the encoding process by mapping each character in \( b \) back to its original character in \( s \).

### Example Walkthrough:

- **Example 1:**
  - Encoded string \( b = "serofedsoc" \)
  - Unique characters in \( b \) are: `{'s', 'e', 'r', 'o', 'f', 'd', 'c'}`
  - Sorted unique characters: `{'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'o', 'r', 's'}`
  - Mapping: 
    - `c -> s`
    - `d -> r`
    - `e -> e`
    - `f -> d`
    - `o -> o`
    - `r -> f`
    - `s -> c`
  - Decoded string \( s = "codeforces" \)

- **Example 2:**
  - Encoded string \( b = "ttf" \)
  - Unique characters in \( b \) are: `{'t', 'f'}`
  - Sorted unique characters: `{'f', 't'}`
  - Mapping:
    - `f -> t`
    - `t -> f`
  - Decoded string \( s = "fft" \)

- **Example 3:**
  - Encoded string \( b = "tlrhgmaoi" \)
  - Unique characters in \( b \) are: `{'a', 'e', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'l', 'm', 'o', 'r', 't'}`
  - Sorted unique characters: `{'a', 'e', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'l', 'm', 'o', 'r', 't'}`
  - Mapping:
    - `a -> t`
    - `e -> r`
    - `g -> m`
    - `h -> l`
    - `i -> o`
    - `l -> h`
    - `m -> g`
    - `o -> i`
    - `r -> e`
    - `t -> a`
  - Decoded string \( s = "algorithm" \)

- **Example 4:**
  - Encoded string \( b = "w" \)
  - Unique characters in \( b \) are: `{'w'}`
  - Sorted unique characters: `{'w'}`
  - Mapping:
    - `w -> w`
  - Decoded string \( s = "w" \)

- **Example 5:**
  - Encoded string \( b = "hnndledmnhlttin" \)
  - Unique characters in \( b \) are: `{'d', 'e', 'h', 'i', 'l', 'n', 't'}`
  - Sorted unique characters: `{'d', 'e', 'h', 'i', 'l', 'n', 't'}`
  - Mapping:
    - `d -> t`
    - `e -> r`
    - `h -> l`
    - `i -> o`
    - `l -> h`
    - `n -> d`
    - `t -> e`
  - Decoded string \( s = "meetinthemiddle" \)
