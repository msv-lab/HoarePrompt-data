Output State: `b` must contain at least one character, `i` is equal to the length of `b`, `s` is the concatenation of all characters in `b` as per their mapping in `char_map`.

In this final state, the variable `b` still contains its original string of lowercase Latin letters. The variable `i` has been incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop until it equals the length of `b`. The variable `s` has been updated in each iteration by appending the character mapped to `c` from `char_map`, resulting in `s` being the full concatenated string of these mapped characters.
