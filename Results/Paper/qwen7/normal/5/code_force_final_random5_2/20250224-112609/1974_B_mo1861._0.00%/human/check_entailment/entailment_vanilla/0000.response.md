Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly decodes the encoded string \( b \) back to the original string \( s \).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string \( b \) and the encoded string itself.

2. **Character Mapping Construction:**
   - In the `func_1` function, a dictionary `char_map` is created to map each unique character in the encoded string \( b \) to its corresponding character in the auxiliary string \( r \).
   - The characters in \( b \) are sorted and iterated over.
   - For each character \( c \) in the sorted set of \( b \), the corresponding character in \( r \) is calculated as the character at position \( len(b) - i - 1 \) in the alphabetically ordered set of unique characters of \( b \).

3. **Decoding Process:**
   - A new string \( s \) is constructed by replacing each character in \( b \) with its mapped character from `char_map`.

### Verification of Correctness:

1. **Mapping Construction:**
   - The mapping is constructed such that the first character in the sorted unique set of \( b \) maps to the last character in the alphabetically ordered set, the second character maps to the second last, and so on.
   - This ensures that the reverse process of encoding is followed accurately.

2. **Decoding Logic:**
   - The decoding logic correctly reverses the encoding process by mapping each character in \( b \) back to its original character in \( s \).

### Example Walkthrough:

- **Example 1:**
  - Encoded string \( b = "serofedsoc" \)
  - Unique characters in \( b \) are: `{'s', 'e', 'r', 'o', 'f', 'd', 'c'}`
  - Sorted unique characters: `{'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'o', 'r', 's'}`
  - Mapping: 
    - `c -> s`
    - `d -> r`
    - `e -> e`
    - `f -> d`
    - `o -> o`
    - `r -> f`
    - `s -> c`
  - Decoded string \( s = "codeforces" \)

- **Example 2:**
  - Encoded string \( b = "ttf" \)
  - Unique characters in \( b \) are: `{'t', 'f'}`
  - Sorted unique characters: `{'f', 't'}`
  - Mapping:
    - `f -> t`
    - `t -> f`
  - Decoded string \( s = "fft" \)

- **Example 3:**
  - Encoded string \( b = "tlrhgmaoi" \)
  - Unique characters in \( b \) are: `{'a', 'e', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'l', 'm', 'o', 'r', 't'}`
  - Sorted unique characters: `{'a', 'e', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'l', 'm', 'o', 'r', 't'}`
  - Mapping:
    - `a -> t`
    - `e -> r`
    - `g -> m`
    - `h -> l`
    - `i -> o`
    - `l -> h`
    - `m -> g`
    - `o -> i`
    - `r -> e`
    - `t -> a`
  - Decoded string \( s = "algorithm" \)

- **Example 4:**
  - Encoded string \( b = "w" \)
  - Unique characters in \( b \) are: `{'w'}`
  - Sorted unique characters: `{'w'}`
  - Mapping:
    - `w -> w`
  - Decoded string \( s = "w" \)

- **Example 5:**
  - Encoded string \( b = "hnndledmnhlttin" \)
  - Unique characters in \( b \) are: `{'d', 'e', 'h', 'i', 'l', 'n', 't'}`
  - Sorted unique characters: `{'d', 'e', 'h', 'i', 'l', 'n', 't'}`
  - Mapping:
    - `d -> t`
    - `e -> r`
    - `h -> l`
    - `i -> o`
    - `l -> h`
    - `n -> d`
    - `t -> e`
  - Decoded string \( s = "meetinthemiddle" \)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the decoding process as per the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
