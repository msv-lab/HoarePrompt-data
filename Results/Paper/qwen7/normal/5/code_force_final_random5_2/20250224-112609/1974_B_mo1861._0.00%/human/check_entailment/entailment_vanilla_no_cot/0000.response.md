Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly decodes the encoded string `b` back to the original string `s`. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Character Mapping**: The function `func_1` creates a dictionary `char_map` where each unique character in the encoded string `b` is mapped to its corresponding character in the auxiliary string `r`. This mapping is done by sorting the unique characters of `b` and assigning them their symmetric positions in an alphabetically ordered list of unique characters.

2. **Symmetric Position Calculation**: For each character in `b`, the program finds its position in the sorted unique characters list and maps it to the corresponding character in the reversed order of the alphabet. This is achieved by calculating the symmetric position as `len(b) - i - 1`, where `i` is the index of the character in the sorted unique characters list.

3. **Decoding Process**: The decoded string `s` is constructed by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character from the `char_map`.

Given these steps, the program accurately decodes the encoded strings as demonstrated in the provided examples. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
