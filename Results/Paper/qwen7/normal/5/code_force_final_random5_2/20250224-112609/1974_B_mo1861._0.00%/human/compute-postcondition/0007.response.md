Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `c`. These are the variables that change with each iteration of the loop.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over the sorted set of characters in the string `b`. The variable `i` represents the index of the current character `c` in this sorted set.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
   - `char_map` is a dictionary with one key-value pair `{c: 'z'}`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `char_map[c]` is 'y'.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is 1, it means that `c` is the first character in the sorted set of `b`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - Therefore, `c` will be the second character in the sorted set of `b`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `b` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `char_map` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
   - `c` will be the second character in the sorted set of `b`.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `char_map` is a dictionary with one key-value pair {c: 'z'}, `i` is 2, and `c` is the second character in the sorted set of `b`**.
