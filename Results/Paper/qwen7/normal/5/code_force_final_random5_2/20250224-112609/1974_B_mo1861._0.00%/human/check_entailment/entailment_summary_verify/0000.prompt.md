You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a string `b` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string `s`. Each character in `b` is mapped to 'a' using a predefined mapping scheme, resulting in `s`. Additionally, the function sets an integer `i` to the length of `b`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly decode the string. Specifically, the issue lies in the `char_map` creation process. The mapping should pair each character in the sorted unique set of characters with its symmetric counterpart, but the current implementation incorrectly maps characters.

For example, consider the encoded string `b = "serofedsoc"`. The unique characters in sorted order are `cdefors`, and their symmetric counterparts should be `crdesof`. However, the current implementation creates the `char_map` as follows:

- `c` -> `s`
- `d` -> `r`
- `e` -> `e`
- `f` -> `d`
- `o` -> `c`
- `r` -> `f`
- `s` -> `o`

This results in the incorrect decoded string `"sreorfsoc"`, which is different from the expected `"codeforces"`.

To fix this, the `char_map` should map each character to its symmetric counterpart correctly. Here is the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    char_map = {}
    unique_chars = sorted(set(b))
    for i in range(len(unique_chars)):
        char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[-(i + 1)]
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
    return s
```

With this correction, the program should work correctly for all test cases.
