    #State: Output State: `b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character in `b` maps to the character 'a', `i` is 1, and `char_map[c]` is 'a'.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates over each unique character in the sorted form of `b`, assigning a new value to `char_map[c]` based on the formula `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`. Since the loop runs for each unique character and `i` starts from 0, the last character in the sorted unique list will map to 'a' (since `len(b) - i - 1` would be 0 for the last character). As the loop progresses, each character will map to a letter starting from 'z' and decreasing until it reaches 'a'. Given that the loop processes each unique character exactly once, all unique characters in `b` will map to 'a' in the final state.
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
        
    #State: Output State: `b` must contain at least one character, `i` is equal to the length of `b`, `s` is a string composed of the characters corresponding to each character in `b` from the `char_map`.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of the string `b`, as it increments by 1 in each iteration. The variable `s` will be a concatenation of all the characters mapped to 'a' in `b` according to the `char_map`.
    return s
    #The program returns a string `s` which is composed of characters corresponding to each character 'a' in string `b` from the `char_map`, and the length of `b` is stored in `i`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `b` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string `s`. Each character in `b` is mapped to 'a' using a predefined mapping scheme, resulting in `s`. Additionally, the function sets an integer `i` to the length of `b`.
