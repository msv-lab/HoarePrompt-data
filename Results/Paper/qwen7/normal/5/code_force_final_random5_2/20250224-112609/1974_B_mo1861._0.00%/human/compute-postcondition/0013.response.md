Output State: **`b` must contain at least one character, `i` is 1, `s` is updated by adding the character corresponding to `c` from the `char_map`.**

Explanation: The code `s += char_map[c]` updates the string `s` by appending the character from `char_map` that corresponds to the key `c`. The variable `b` and the integer `i` remain unchanged.
