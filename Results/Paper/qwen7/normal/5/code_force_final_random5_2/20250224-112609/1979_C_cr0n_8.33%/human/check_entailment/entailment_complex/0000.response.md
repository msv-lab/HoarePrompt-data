Reasoning:
- The annotated program correctly describes the logic of the function `func_1()`.
- The function reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `vals`.
- It calculates the product of all multipliers (`prod`).
- Then, it creates a list `vprod` where each element is `prod // r` for each `r` in `vals`.
- It calculates `den` as the difference between `prod` and the sum of elements in `vprod`.
- If `den` is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution exists.
- Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` as a space-separated string, which represents the required bets.

Given the problem requirements:
- The total amount of coins bet must be strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.
- The logic in `func_1()` checks if the sum of `vprod` is less than `prod`. If so, it prints the `vprod` values; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

The logic in the function matches the problem's requirements. Therefore, the function is correct according to the provided description and states.

Correctness: **True**
