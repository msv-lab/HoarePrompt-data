Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program attempts to distribute the coins using a method that involves calculating the product of all multipliers and then distributing the coins based on the division of this product by each individual multiplier. However, this approach does not guarantee that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes will be strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
5
5 5 5 5 5
```

The program calculates the product of the multipliers as `5 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 = 3125`. Then, it divides this product by each individual multiplier to get the distribution of coins: `[625, 625, 625, 625, 625]`.

However, if the first outcome wins, the player would receive `5 * 625 = 3125` coins, which is equal to the total amount of coins bet, not strictly greater. This violates the requirement that the total amount of coins bet must be strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
