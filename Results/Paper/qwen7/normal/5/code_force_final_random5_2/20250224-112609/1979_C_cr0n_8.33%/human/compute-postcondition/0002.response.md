Output State: **`prod` is 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 50, `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `prod` to 1. No changes are made to `t`, `N`, or `vals`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
