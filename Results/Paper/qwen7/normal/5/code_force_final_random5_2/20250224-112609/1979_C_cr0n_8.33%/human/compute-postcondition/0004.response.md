Output State: **`prod` is equal to `1 * r`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 50, `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `r` is the first element in the list `vals`**.

Explanation: The variable `prod` is updated by multiplying its current value (which is 1) by `r`. Since `r` is the first element in the list `vals`, `prod` now equals `1 * r`. All other variables remain unchanged.
