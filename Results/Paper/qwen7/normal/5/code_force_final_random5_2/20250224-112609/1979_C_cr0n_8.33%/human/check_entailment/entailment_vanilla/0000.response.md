Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to distribute coins among `n` outcomes.
- For each outcome `i`, if it wins, we get back `k_i * x_i` coins, where `x_i` is the amount bet on outcome `i`.
- The total amount bet must be strictly less than the amount received for each possible winning outcome.
- If no such distribution exists, print `-1`.

### Given Program Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   ```python
   cases = int(input())
   for n in range(cases):
       func_1()
   ```
   This part correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.

2. **Function Definition:**
   ```python
   def func_1():
       N = int(input().strip())
       vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
       prod = 1
       for r in vals:
           prod *= r
       vprod = [prod // r for r in vals]
       den = prod - sum(vprod)
       if den <= 0:
           print(-1)
           return
       print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
   ```
   - `N` is the number of outcomes.
   - `vals` stores the multipliers `k_i` for each outcome.
   - `prod` calculates the product of all multipliers.
   - `vprod` calculates the value to bet on each outcome as `prod // k_i`.
   - `den` calculates the difference between the total product and the sum of `vprod`.
   - If `den` is less than or equal to zero, it prints `-1` because the total bet would not be strictly less than the winnings.
   - Otherwise, it prints the bet amounts.

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Bets:**
   - The program calculates `vprod` as `prod // k_i`. However, this does not necessarily ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome.
   - For example, consider the case where `k_i` values are very large. The product `prod` could be extremely large, making `vprod` very small, which might not satisfy the condition.

2. **No Check for Feasibility:**
   - The program does not check if the calculated `vprod` values are feasible (i.e., whether they meet the condition that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome).

### Example Test Case Analysis:
Let's take the example from the problem statement:
- **Test Case 1:** `3 3 2 7`
  - `prod = 3 * 2 * 7 = 42`
  - `vprod = [42 // 3, 42 // 2, 42 // 7] = [14, 21, 6]`
  - `sum(vprod) = 14 + 21 + 6 = 41`
  - `den = 42 - 41 = 1`
  - Since `den > 0`, it prints `14 21 6`, but this does not guarantee that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
