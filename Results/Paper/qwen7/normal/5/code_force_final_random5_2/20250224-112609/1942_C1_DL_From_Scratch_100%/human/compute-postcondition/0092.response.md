Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers n, x, and y, followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n. It calculates and prints the total number of times the difference between consecutive elements in the list of integers is exactly 1, plus (x - 2) for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the results for each case.**
