Output State: **`i` is `x - 2`, `num` is `1`, `count` is `1`**

Explanation: The code `count += 1` increments the value of `count` by 1. Initially, `count` is not defined, so it is assumed to be 0. After executing the code, `count` becomes 1. The values of `i` and `num` remain unchanged from their initial states.
