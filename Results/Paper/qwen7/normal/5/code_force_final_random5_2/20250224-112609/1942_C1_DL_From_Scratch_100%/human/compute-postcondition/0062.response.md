Output State: **`i` is `x - 1`, `num` is `list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1`, `count` is incremented by 1 if `num` equals 1, and `list0` is a list of integers obtained from user input.**

Explanation: The code `list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the user input and converts each element to an integer, storing them in the list `list0`. The values of `i`, `num`, and `count` remain unchanged from their initial state. The variable `list0` now holds the list of integers entered by the user.
