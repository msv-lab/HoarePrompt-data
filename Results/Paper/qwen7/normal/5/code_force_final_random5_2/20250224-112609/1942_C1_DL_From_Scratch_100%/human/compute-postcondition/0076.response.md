Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `x`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `x - 1`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i < x - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `num` is -1 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted)
   - `count` is 2 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted)
   - `x` is the same as before (this variable is not explicitly given its value, but we know it hasn't changed)

4. **Determine if the loop can execute again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `x - 1`.
   - Given `i` is currently 2, the loop will execute again if `x > 3`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.
   - `x` remains the same.

6. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` is now 3.
   - `num` remains -1.
   - `count` remains 2.
   - `x` remains the same as before.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 3, `num` is -1, `count` is 2, `x` is the same as before**
