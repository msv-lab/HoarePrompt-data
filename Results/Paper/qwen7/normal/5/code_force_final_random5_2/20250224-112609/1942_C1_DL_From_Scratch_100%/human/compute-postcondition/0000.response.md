Output State: **T is an integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, the first line of the input contains three integers n, x, and y, where n, x, and y are integers such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and y = 0; the second line of each test case contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.**

Explanation: The code `T = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `T`. The precondition that `T` is an integer such that `1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4` remains valid, and for each of the `T` test cases, the input format specified is maintained. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` for each test case will be read subsequently, but their specific values are not known at this point.
