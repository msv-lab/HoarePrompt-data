Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes two positive integers n and m within the range 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, where n and m are derived from a test case with a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). It returns a result based on the values of n and m.**

This means the function does not take any parameters itself but works with a set of values (n and m) that are part of a larger context involving a test case defined by t. The function then processes these values (n and m) to produce some output.
