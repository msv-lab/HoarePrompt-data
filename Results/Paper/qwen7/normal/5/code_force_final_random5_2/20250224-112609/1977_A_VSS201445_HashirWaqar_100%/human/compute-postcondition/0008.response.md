Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `range(int(input()))` expression. This means the loop will run as many times as the integer input by the user.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop does not depend on any specific variables within its body; it simply runs based on the input integer. Therefore, the loop will continue to run as long as the user provides an integer input.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments**: Since the loop condition is solely based on the user input, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the input itself. The variables `t`, `n`, and `m` are not directly affected by the loop itself but rather by the postconditions given.

4. **Postconditions**: The postconditions provided do not affect the loop continuation since they describe what happens inside the loop body, not the loop condition.

5. **Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute one more time, the user must provide another integer input. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged from the previous iteration unless modified within the loop body, which is not specified here.

Given these points, the state remains the same as the previous iteration because the loop does not modify `t`, `n`, or `m` and continues based on the user input.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `m` is the second integer input by the user**
