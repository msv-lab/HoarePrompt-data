The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \) (where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 100 \)). For each test case, it checks if \( n \) is greater than or equal to \( m \) and if their difference is even. If both conditions are met, it outputs 'YES'; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case. The number of test cases \( t \) (where \( 1 \leq t \leq 100 \)) remains unchanged throughout the execution.
