You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and each test case consists of two positive integers n and m such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `t` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. After all the iterations of the loop, `t` will still be the same as its initial value because the loop does not modify `t`. For each iteration, the loop reads two integers `n` and `m`, checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if their difference is even. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. Regardless of the outcome of these checks, the value of `t` remains unchanged.
    #
    #In summary, the final value of `t` is the same as its initial value, and the loop's output ('YES' or 'NO') depends on the values of `n` and `m` provided during each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \) (where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 100 \)). For each test case, it checks if \( n \) is greater than or equal to \( m \) and if their difference is even. If both conditions are met, it outputs 'YES'; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case. The number of test cases \( t \) (where \( 1 \leq t \leq 100 \)) remains unchanged throughout the execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - Each move either adds 1 cube or removes 1 cube.
   - The net change in the number of cubes after `n` moves is `n - m`.

2. **Conditions for Validity:**
   - The total number of moves `n` must be at least `m` because we can't have more cubes than the number of moves.
   - The difference between the number of moves and the final number of cubes, i.e., `(n - m)`, must be even. This is because every addition and removal of a cube is a pair of moves, and thus the difference must be even.

3. **Checking the Given Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
   - It checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if `(n - m)` is even.
   - If both conditions are met, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

4. **Verification:**
   - For the first test case (`3 3`):
     - `n = 3`, `m = 3`
     - `n - m = 0` (even), and `n >= m` (true)
     - Output: "YES"
   - For the second test case (`2 4`):
     - `n = 2`, `m = 4`
     - `n - m = -2` (even), but `n < m` (false)
     - Output: "NO"
   - For the third test case (`5 3`):
     - `n = 5`, `m = 3`
     - `n - m = 2` (even), and `n >= m` (true)
     - Output: "YES"

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves.
