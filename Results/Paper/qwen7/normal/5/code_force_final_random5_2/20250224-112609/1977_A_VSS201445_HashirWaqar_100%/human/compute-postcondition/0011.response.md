Output: **NO**

Explanation: The initial state indicates that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, inclusive. However, the values of `n` and `m` are determined by user input and are only mentioned to be converted to integers. The print statement simply outputs the string 'NO', regardless of the values of `n` and `m`. Therefore, the output will be the string 'NO'.
