Output State: The value of `t` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. After all iterations of the loop, `t` will not have been altered unless new inputs to the loop satisfy the condition `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0`, in which case the loop would continue with new values of `n` and `m`. However, since the problem does not provide specific inputs that would change `t`, and given that the loop's primary effect is printing 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition without modifying `t`, the final value of `t` remains the same as its initial value.

In simpler terms, the value of `t` stays the same after all iterations of the loop because the loop itself does not modify `t`; it only reads new values of `n` and `m` from user input and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the given conditions.
