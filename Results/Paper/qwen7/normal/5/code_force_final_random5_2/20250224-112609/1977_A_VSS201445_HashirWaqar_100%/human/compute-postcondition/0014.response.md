Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is the integer input by the user, `m` is the integer input by the user in the previous iteration**.

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input from the user and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The initial conditions for `t` and `m` are still valid, and `n` now holds the value of the new integer input by the user.
