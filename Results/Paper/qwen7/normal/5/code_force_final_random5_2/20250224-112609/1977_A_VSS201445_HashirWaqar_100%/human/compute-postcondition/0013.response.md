Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `n` is the first integer input by the user.
   - `m` is the second integer input by the user.
   - `n` and `m` are converted to integers.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for the number of times specified by the user input inside `range(int(input()))`.
   - The loop will execute as long as the user inputs a valid integer.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know that if the condition `n >= m` and the difference between `n` and `m` is even, no changes are made. Otherwise, no changes are made.

4. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - We need to determine the state of the variables at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

5. **Next Input**:
   - The next input will be another integer, let's call it `k`.

6. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by the user input, the variable `k` will be the new value of `n` for the next iteration.
   - The variable `m` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
   - The variable `t` remains unchanged as well.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

- `t` is still a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `n` (which becomes `k` in the next iteration) is the new integer input by the user.
- `m` remains the same as the second integer input by the user in the previous iteration.
- No changes are made to `t`, `n`, or `m` unless the condition `n >= m` and the difference between `n` and `m` is even is met, but since no changes are made otherwise, we assume this condition is not met.

**State:**
**`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `n` is the new integer input by the user, `m` is the second integer input by the user in the previous iteration, and no changes are made.**

To be more precise in the format requested:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `n` is the new integer input by the user, `m` is the second integer input by the user in the previous iteration**.
