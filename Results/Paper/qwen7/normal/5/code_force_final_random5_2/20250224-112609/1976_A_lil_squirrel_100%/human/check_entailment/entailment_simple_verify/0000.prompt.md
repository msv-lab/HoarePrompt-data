You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    password = input().strip()
    print(func_1(n, password))

def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    password = input().strip()
    print(func_1(n, password))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and password is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `password` is a non-empty string of length `n` (where 1 <= n <= 20), `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the `password`, and `letters` is a list containing all the letters from the `password`.
    #
    #In this final state, every character in `password` has been processed, and based on whether each character is a digit or a letter, it has been appended to either the `digits` list or the `letters` list. The order of elements in both lists will correspond to their original order in the `password` string.
    if (letters != sorted(letters)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `password` is a non-empty string of length `n` (where 1 <= n <= 20), `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the `password`, and `letters` is a list containing all the letters from the `password`. The letters in `letters` list are in sorted order.
    if (digits != sorted(digits)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `password` is a non-empty string of length `n` (where 1 <= n <= 20), `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the `password`, and `letters` is a list containing all the letters from the `password`. The letters in `letters` list are in sorted order, and the `digits` list is sorted.
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: Output State: The function does not return anything.
    #
    #Explanation: After all the iterations of the loop, if the loop did not encounter any situation where `password[i]` is an alphabet and `password[i + 1]` is a digit, it means the condition `if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit(): return 'NO'` was never met throughout the entire loop execution. Therefore, the function will not return anything and will continue to its next line of code, which in this case is simply ending without returning any value.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the conditions for a strong password as described in the problem statement. Here’s a breakdown of how it handles each condition:

1. **Only lowercase Latin letters and digits**: The program checks the characters one by one and separates them into `letters` and `digits` lists. This ensures that only these types of characters are considered.

2. **Digits in non-decreasing order**: After collecting all digits, the program sorts them and compares the sorted list with the original list of digits. If they do not match, it returns "NO".

3. **Letters in non-decreasing order**: Similarly, after collecting all letters, the program sorts them and compares the sorted list with the original list of letters. If they do not match, it returns "NO".

4. **No digit after a letter**: The program iterates through the password and checks if a letter is followed by a digit. If such a sequence is found, it returns "NO".

Given the examples and the logic implemented, the program correctly identifies whether a password meets the specified criteria for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
