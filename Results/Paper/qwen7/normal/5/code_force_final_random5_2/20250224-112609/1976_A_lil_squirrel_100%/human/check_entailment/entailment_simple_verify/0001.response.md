### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires verifying if a password meets the following conditions:
     - Consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
     - No digit comes after a letter.
     - All digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
     - All letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case.
   - For each password, it separates the characters into two lists: `letters` and `digits`.
   - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It iterates through the password to ensure there are no digits coming after letters.
   - If any of these conditions fail, it returns "NO". Otherwise, it returns "YES".

3. **Verification**:
   - The logic for checking the sorted order of letters and digits is correct.
   - The logic for ensuring no digit comes after a letter is also correct.
   - However, there is a subtle issue with the implementation of the digit check. The code currently checks the order of characters in the `password` string, but it does not ensure that the digits are contiguous and sorted within the password.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Checking Sorted Order**:
  - The code correctly checks if `letters` and `digits` are sorted in non-decreasing order.
  - This part of the code is accurate.

- **Checking No Digit After Letter**:
  - The code checks if there is a digit immediately after a letter using the condition `if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit(): return 'NO'`.
  - This check is necessary but insufficient because it only checks adjacent characters. It does not guarantee that all digits are sorted and contiguous.

### Example to Illustrate the Issue:

Consider the password `123a45b6`.

- The `letters` list would be `['a', 'b']`, which is sorted.
- The `digits` list would be `['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6']`, which is also sorted.
- The code would correctly identify that the letters are sorted and the digits are sorted.
- However, the code would not catch the issue that the digits `123` are followed by `a`, and then `45` and `6` are not contiguous.

### Corrected Implementation:

To ensure that all digits are contiguous and sorted, we need to check the entire sequence of digits together. Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
    
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    if any(password[i+1].isdigit() for i in range(len(letters)) if password[i].isdigit()):
        return 'NO'
    return 'YES'
```

- **Key Change**:
  - Added a check `if any(password[i+1].isdigit() for i in range(len(letters)) if password[i].isdigit())` to ensure that there are no digits between letters.

### Final Evaluation:

Given the analysis, the original implementation had a flaw in ensuring that digits are contiguous and sorted. The corrected implementation ensures that all conditions are met.

**Final: False**

The original assessment was inaccurate due to the oversight in ensuring the contiguity and order of digits.
