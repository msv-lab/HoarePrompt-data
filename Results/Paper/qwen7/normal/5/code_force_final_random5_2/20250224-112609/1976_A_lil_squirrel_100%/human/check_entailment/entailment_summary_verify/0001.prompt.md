You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    password = input().strip()
    print(func_1(n, password))

def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer where 1 <= n <= 20, and `password`, a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. It separates the characters in `password` into two lists: one for digits and one for letters. If the letters are not in sorted order, or the digits are not in sorted order, or if there is a letter followed immediately by a digit in the `password`, the function returns 'NO'. Otherwise, it returns 'YES'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to check if a password meets specific conditions:
   - The password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
   - There should be no digit that comes after a letter.
   - All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case.
   - For each password, it separates the characters into two lists: `letters` and `digits`.
   - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It iterates through the password to ensure there are no digits coming after letters.
   - If any of these conditions fail, it returns "NO". Otherwise, it returns "YES".

3. **Verification**:
   - The logic for checking the sorted order of letters and digits is correct.
   - The logic for ensuring no digit comes after a letter is also correct.
   - The code handles all the required conditions as specified in the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the conditions for a strong password as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
