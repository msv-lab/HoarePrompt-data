Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and password is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits; `letters` is an empty list; `digits` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for ch in password:
    if ch.isdigit():
        digits.append(ch)
    else:
        letters.append(ch)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `password` is a non-empty string, `ch` is the first character of `password`. If `ch` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing the element `ch`. If `ch` is not a digit, `letters` is a list containing the character `ch`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `password` is a non-empty string, `ch` is the second character of `password`, `digits` is a list containing the first character of `password` if it was a digit, otherwise `letters` is a list containing the first character of `password` if it was not a digit, and in both cases, either `digits` or `letters` will contain the second character of `password`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `password` is a non-empty string, `ch` is the third character of `password`. If the third character `ch` is a digit, `digits` is a list containing the first and third characters of `password`, and `letters` is an empty list. Otherwise, `digits` is a list containing the first character of `password` if it was a digit, and `letters` is a list containing the first and third characters of `password` if the first character was not a digit.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
