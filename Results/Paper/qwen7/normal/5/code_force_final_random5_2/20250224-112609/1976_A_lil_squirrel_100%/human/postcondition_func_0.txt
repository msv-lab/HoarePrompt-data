The function accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer where 1 <= n <= 20, and `password`, a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. It separates the characters in `password` into two lists: one for digits and one for letters. If the letters are not in sorted order, or the digits are not in sorted order, or if there is a letter followed immediately by a digit in the `password`, the function returns 'NO'. Otherwise, it returns 'YES'.
