Reasoning:
1. The program correctly separates the characters into two lists: `letters` and `digits`.
2. It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
3. It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
4. It iterates through the password to ensure that no digit follows a letter. If it finds such a sequence, it returns 'NO'.
5. If none of the above conditions fail, it returns 'YES', indicating that the password meets all the criteria.

Given the logic and the steps described, the program correctly implements the requirements for a strong password as specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
