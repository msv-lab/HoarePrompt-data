Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and password is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits; `letters` is an empty list; `digits` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `digits`. The values of `n` and `password` remain unchanged from their initial state. The variable `letters` is still an empty list.
