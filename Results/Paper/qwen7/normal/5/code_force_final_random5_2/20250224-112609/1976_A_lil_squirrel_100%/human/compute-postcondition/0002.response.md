Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for ch in password:`. The objects involved here are `ch`, `password`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `password` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
   - `ch` will take on each character of `password` one by one during each iteration of the loop.

3. **Understand the loop execution condition**: For the loop to execute, `password` must contain at least one character. Since `password` is defined as a string of length `n` (where `1 <= n <= 20`), it inherently contains characters.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `password` must be a non-empty string (since it is a string of length `n` and `n` is at least 1).
   - `ch` will be the first character of `password` when the loop starts.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `password` must be a non-empty string.
- `ch` must be the first character of `password`.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`password` is a non-empty string, `ch` is the first character of `password`**.
