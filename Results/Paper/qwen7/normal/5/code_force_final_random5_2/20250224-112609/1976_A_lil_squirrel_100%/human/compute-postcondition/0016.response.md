Output State: **`password` is a non-empty string, `ch` is the third character of `password`, `digits` is a list containing the first character of `password` and the character `ch`, `letters` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code appends the character `ch` (which is the third character of `password`) to the `digits` list. Since `digits` initially contained the first character of `password` if it was a digit, and the second character of `password` if it was not a digit, after appending `ch`, `digits` now contains the first character of `password` and `ch`. The `letters` list remains unchanged and is still an empty list because `ch` was appended to `digits` and not to `letters`.
