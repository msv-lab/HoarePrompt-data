Output State: **The program returns 'YES'**

Explanation: Given the initial state, the function checks each character in the `password` string to see if there is an alphabet followed by a digit. If such a pair is found, the function returns 'NO'. Since the problem statement specifies that the function does not return anything, it implies that no such pair was found throughout the entire iteration of the loop. Therefore, after completing the loop, the function executes the last line, which is `return 'YES'`, and returns the string 'YES'.
