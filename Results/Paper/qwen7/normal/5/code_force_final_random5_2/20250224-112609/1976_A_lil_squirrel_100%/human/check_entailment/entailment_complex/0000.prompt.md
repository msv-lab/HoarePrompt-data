Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    password = input().strip()
    print(func_1(n, password))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and password is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `password` is a non-empty string of length `n` (where 1 <= n <= 20), `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the `password`, and `letters` is a list containing all the letters from the `password`.
    #
    #In this final state, every character in `password` has been processed, and based on whether each character is a digit or a letter, it has been appended to either the `digits` list or the `letters` list. The order of elements in both lists will correspond to their original order in the `password` string.
    if (letters != sorted(letters)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `password` is a non-empty string of length `n` (where 1 <= n <= 20), `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the `password`, and `letters` is a list containing all the letters from the `password`. The letters in `letters` list are in sorted order.
    if (digits != sorted(digits)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `password` is a non-empty string of length `n` (where 1 <= n <= 20), `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the `password`, and `letters` is a list containing all the letters from the `password`. The letters in `letters` list are in sorted order, and the `digits` list is sorted.
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: Output State: The function does not return anything.
    #
    #Explanation: After all the iterations of the loop, if the loop did not encounter any situation where `password[i]` is an alphabet and `password[i + 1]` is a digit, it means the condition `if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit(): return 'NO'` was never met throughout the entire loop execution. Therefore, the function will not return anything and will continue to its next line of code, which in this case is simply ending without returning any value.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer where 1 <= n <= 20, and `password`, a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. It separates the characters in `password` into two lists: one for digits and one for letters. If the letters are not in sorted order, or the digits are not in sorted order, or if there is a letter followed immediately by a digit in the `password`, the function returns 'NO'. Otherwise, it returns 'YES'.
