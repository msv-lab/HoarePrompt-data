Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `i` is 1, `a` is the first integer input, `b` is the second integer input, `c` is the third integer input. Since both the if and else parts do not change the values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition.**
