Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `num_of_lens` remains a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from `nums` and its value is the total count of occurrences of that element in `nums`. The variable `res` is updated to include the sum of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` for every `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` that is greater than or equal to 3, and the sum of `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` for every `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` that is greater than or equal to 2, where `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except the current `cnt`. The value of `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except the current `cnt` for each iteration of the loop.
