Output State: **`num_of_lens` is a non-empty dictionary with one less key-value pair, `cnt` is the next integer greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, and `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `res` by adding `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. `num_of_lens` is still a non-empty dictionary with one less key-value pair, `cnt` is still the next integer greater than or equal to 2, and `total_sum` is still the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`.
