Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State
- `num_of_lens` is a non-empty dictionary.
- `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`.
- `res` is the original value of `res` plus either `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` if `cnt >= 2`, or `math.comb(cnt, 3) * total_sum` if `cnt < 2`.
- `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except the current `cnt`.

### Loop Head
The loop iterates over `cnt` using `for cnt in num_of_lens.values()`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable being iterated over is `cnt`. The other variables (`num_of_lens`, `res`, `total_sum`) are not directly modified within the loop head but are used as part of the loop condition and logic.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are values left in `num_of_lens.values()`.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - `num_of_lens`: Since the loop is iterating over the values of `num_of_lens`, `num_of_lens` itself does not change in the loop head.
   - `cnt`: This is the current value being processed in the loop.
   - `res`: This is updated based on the value of `cnt` and `total_sum`, but it is not directly modified in the loop head.
   - `total_sum`: This is calculated based on the remaining values in `num_of_lens` but is not directly modified in the loop head.

### Next Iteration
For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `cnt` must be available from `num_of_lens.values()`. Therefore, `num_of_lens` should still be a non-empty dictionary, and `cnt` should be the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`.

### New State
- `num_of_lens` is a non-empty dictionary (since we are iterating over its values).
- `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens.values()` (the next key-value pair in the iteration).
- `res` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `total_sum` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

### Final Answer
State: **`num_of_lens` is a non-empty dictionary, `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens.values()`, `res` is the original value of `res` plus either `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` if `cnt >= 2`, or `math.comb(cnt, 3) * total_sum` if `cnt < 2`, and `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except the current `cnt`.**
