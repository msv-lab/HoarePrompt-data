Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop iterates over `cnt` which is taken from `num_of_lens.values()`. Therefore, the only variable in the loop head is `cnt`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are more values in `num_of_lens.values()`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `num_of_lens` is a non-empty dictionary.
   - `cnt` is an integer greater than or equal to 2.
   - `res` is increased by either `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` (if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2) or `math.comb(cnt, 3)` (if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3), where `total_sum` is the sum of the values in `num_of_lens` excluding the value equal to `cnt`.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `cnt` is taken from `num_of_lens.values()`, it will be the next value in `num_of_lens.values()` for the next iteration.
   - `num_of_lens` will now have one less value because the current `cnt` has been processed.
   - `res` will be updated based on the new `cnt` value.

5. **New State**:
   - `num_of_lens` will be a non-empty dictionary with one less key-value pair.
   - `cnt` will be the next value in `num_of_lens.values()`, which means `cnt` will be the next integer greater than or equal to 2.
   - `res` will be updated according to the new `cnt` value.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes.

**State:**
- `num_of_lens` is a non-empty dictionary with one less key-value pair.
- `cnt` is the next integer greater than or equal to 2.
- `res` is increased by either `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` (if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2) or `math.comb(cnt, 3)` (if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3), where `total_sum` is the sum of the values in `num_of_lens` excluding the value equal to `cnt`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`num_of_lens` is a non-empty dictionary with one less key-value pair, `cnt` is the next integer greater than or equal to 2, and `res` is increased by either `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` (if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2) or `math.comb(cnt, 3)` (if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3), where `total_sum` is the sum of the values in `num_of_lens` excluding the value equal to `cnt`.**
