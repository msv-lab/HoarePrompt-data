Output State: **`num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `x` in `nums`; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string that must have at least one more element; `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**.

Explanation: The code updates the count of the element `x` in the dictionary `num_of_lens`. For each occurrence of `x` in the list `nums`, the line `num_of_lens[x] = num_of_lens.get(x, 0) + 1` increments the count of `x` in the dictionary. The other variables remain unchanged.
