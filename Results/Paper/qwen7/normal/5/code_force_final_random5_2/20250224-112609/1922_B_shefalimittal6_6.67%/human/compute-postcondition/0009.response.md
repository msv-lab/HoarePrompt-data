Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `x` and `nums`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `nums`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - **`num_of_lens[x]`**: This variable is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `x` in `nums`. Since the loop is about to start another iteration, `x` will be the next element in `nums`.
   - **`n`**: This variable is an input integer and does not change within the loop.
   - **`nums`**: This list is obtained from splitting the input string and must have at least one more element. For the loop to execute again, `nums` must still have at least one more element.

Given these points, let's adjust the states:

- `num_of_lens[x]`: Since `x` is the current element being processed, `num_of_lens[x]` will be incremented by 1 in this iteration. Therefore, for the next iteration, `x` will be the next element in `nums`, and `num_of_lens[x]` will be incremented by 1.
- `n`: Remains unchanged.
- `nums`: Must still have at least one more element for the loop to execute again.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `x` in `nums`; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string that must have at least two more elements; `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
