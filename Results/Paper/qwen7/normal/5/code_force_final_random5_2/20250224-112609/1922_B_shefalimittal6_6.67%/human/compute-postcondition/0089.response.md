Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in nums:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `nums`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `nums` has at least one element.
   - The variable `x` takes each element from `nums` one by one.

3. **Analyze the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `nums` must have at least one element.
   - `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1, meaning `x` was an element of `nums` in the previous iteration.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` is taken from `nums` in each iteration, and `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented, it means `nums` had at least one element in the previous iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `nums` must still have at least one element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `nums` must have at least one element, and `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1 (this increment happens in the loop body, but we don't need to explicitly show it in the state).

**Final State**:
State: **`nums` must have at least one element, `num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1**
