Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `num_of_lens` is an empty dictionary, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string.**

Explanation: The code `nums = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `nums`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `num_of_lens` remains an empty dictionary.
