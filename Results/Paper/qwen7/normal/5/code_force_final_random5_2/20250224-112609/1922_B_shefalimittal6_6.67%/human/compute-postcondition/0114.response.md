Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `cnt` which is taken from `num_of_lens.values()`.
   - The other variables involved are `res`, `total_sum`, and `num_of_lens`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will continue as long as there are more values in `num_of_lens.values()`.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - `res`: This variable is updated based on the value of `cnt`. However, since we don't know the exact value of `res` before the update, we can't directly adjust it.
   - `total_sum`: This is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except `cnt`. Since `cnt` is being iterated over, `total_sum` will change with each iteration.
   - `num_of_lens`: This dictionary must not be empty, and its values are being iterated over. As long as there are more values in `num_of_lens`, the loop continues.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - At the start of the next iteration, `cnt` will be the next key in `num_of_lens.values()`.
   - `total_sum` will be recalculated without including the current `cnt`.
   - `num_of_lens` must still contain at least one key-value pair for the loop to continue.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `res` remains unchanged because we don't know its exact value before the update.
- `total_sum` will be recalculated without the current `cnt`.
- `num_of_lens` must still contain at least one key-value pair.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, and remains unchanged if `cnt` is less than 2, `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except `cnt`, and `num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair.**
