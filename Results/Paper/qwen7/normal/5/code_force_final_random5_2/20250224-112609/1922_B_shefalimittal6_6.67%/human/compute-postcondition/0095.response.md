Output State: **`res` is 0, `num_of_lens` dictionary contains counts of each unique integer from the original `nums` list, `cnt`, `res`, `t`, and `n` retain their values from the final iteration of the loop, and `nums` is an empty list.**

This means that after processing all elements in the `nums` list, the `num_of_lens` dictionary now holds the count of each unique integer that was present in the original list. The variables `res`, `cnt`, `t`, and `n` maintain their values from the last iteration of the loop, and the `nums` list is now empty since all elements have been processed.
