Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `num_of_lens` remains a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from `nums` and its value is the total count of occurrences of that element in `nums`, `res` is updated to include the sum of `math.comb(cnt, 3)` for every `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` that is greater than or equal to 3, and the sum of `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` for every `cnt` in `num_of_lens.values()` that is greater than or equal to 2, where `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except the current `cnt`; `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The other variables (`t`, `num_of_lens`, and `res`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 and `num_of_lens` is a non-empty dictionary with specific conditions for `res` still holds true.
