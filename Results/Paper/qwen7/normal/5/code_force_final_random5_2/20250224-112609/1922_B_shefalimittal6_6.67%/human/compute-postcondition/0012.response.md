Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `num_of_lens` will be a dictionary where each key is an element from `nums` and its value is the total count of occurrences of that element in `nums`. The variable `n` remains an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, and `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `res` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `res` to 0. Since no operations are performed on `res` within the given code snippet, its value remains unchanged. All other variables and their states remain as they were in the initial state.
