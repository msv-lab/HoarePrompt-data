Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for x in nums:`. This means the variables `x` and `nums` are the ones that can be adjusted.

2. **Understand the Loop Body**: The loop increments `num_of_lens[x]` by 1 if `x` is already in `num_of_lens`, or initializes `num_of_lens[x]` to 1 if `x` is not in `num_of_lens`. This implies that `x` takes on each value from the list `nums` in each iteration.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: We know that `nums` is a non-empty list, and `num_of_lens[x]` is the count of occurrences of `x` in `nums`.

4. **Determine the Next State**: For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be the next element in the list `nums`. Since `nums` is a non-empty list and we don't know the exact elements, we just need to ensure that `x` is set to the next element in the list.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `nums` remains the same as it is a list and does not change within the loop.
- `x` will be the next element in the list `nums`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`nums` is a non-empty list, `x` is the next element in the list `nums`**.
