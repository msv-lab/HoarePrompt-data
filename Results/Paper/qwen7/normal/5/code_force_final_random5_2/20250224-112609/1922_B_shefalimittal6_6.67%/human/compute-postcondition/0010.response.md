Output State: **`num_of_lens[x]` is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `x` in `nums`; `n` is an input integer; `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string that must have at least two more elements; `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); for each `x` in `nums`, `num_of_lens[x]` is updated to reflect the new count.**

Explanation: The code updates the `num_of_lens` dictionary by incrementing the count of each element `x` found in the list `nums`. The other variables (`n`, `nums`, and `t`) remain unchanged. The updated counts for each element in `nums` are stored in `num_of_lens`.
