Output State: **`num_of_lens` must not be empty, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise the value of `res` and `num_of_lens` remains unchanged; `total_sum` is the sum of values in `num_of_lens.values()` where each value is not equal to `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `total_sum` as the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` that are not equal to `cnt`. The values of `num_of_lens` and `res` remain unchanged from their initial state unless `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, in which case `res` would be increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. Since the exact values of `num_of_lens` and `cnt` are not provided, we keep the conditions as described.
