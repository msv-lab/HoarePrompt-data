Postcondition: `num_of_lens` is a non-empty dictionary with one less key-value pair, `cnt` is the next integer in `num_of_lens.values()`, `res` is increased by either `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, or `math.comb(cnt, 3)` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, and `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens` except `cnt`.
