Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `num_of_lens` will be a dictionary where each key is an element from `nums` and its value is the total count of occurrences of that element in `nums`. The variable `n` remains an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, and `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `num_of_lens` will contain the frequency count of each unique number present in the list `nums`. The values of `n` and `t` will remain as they were initially, and `nums` will still be the list of integers obtained from splitting the input string.
