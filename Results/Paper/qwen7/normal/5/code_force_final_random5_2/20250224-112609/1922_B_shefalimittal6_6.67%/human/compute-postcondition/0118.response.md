Output State: **`total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except `cnt`, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)` if `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, and remains unchanged if `cnt` is less than 3.**

Explanation: The code calculates `total_sum` as the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except for `cnt`. This does not affect the value of `res` directly, but it does depend on whether `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged. The other variables remain in their initial states as described in the precondition.
