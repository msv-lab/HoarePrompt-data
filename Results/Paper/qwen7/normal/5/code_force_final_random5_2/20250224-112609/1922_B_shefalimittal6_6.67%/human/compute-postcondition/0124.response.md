Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, the `num_of_lens` dictionary will be empty because it gets cleared with each new iteration of the loop. The variable `res` will contain the sum of all combinatorial calculations performed over all integers in `num_of_lens.values()` that met the conditions (specifically, `math.comb(cnt, 3)` for counts greater than or equal to 3, and `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum` for counts greater than or equal to 2, where `total_sum` is the sum of all values in `num_of_lens.values()` except the current `cnt`). This sum is calculated for each unique number in all the `nums` lists provided during the loop iterations.
