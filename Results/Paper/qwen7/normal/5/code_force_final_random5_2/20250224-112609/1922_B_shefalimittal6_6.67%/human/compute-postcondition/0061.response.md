Output State: **`num_of_lens` is a non-empty dictionary, `cnt` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`, and `total_sum` is the sum of the values in `num_of_lens` excluding the value equal to `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the sum of the values in the dictionary `num_of_lens` excluding the value that is equal to `cnt`. The variables `num_of_lens` and `cnt` remain unchanged from their initial state. The variable `res` is increased by `math.comb(cnt, 3)`, but its new value is not specified since the initial value of `res` was not given. The variable `total_sum` is assigned the calculated sum of the values in `num_of_lens` excluding the value equal to `cnt`.
