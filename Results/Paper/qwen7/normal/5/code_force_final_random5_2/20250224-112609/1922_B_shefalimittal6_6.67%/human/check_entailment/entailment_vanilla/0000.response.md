Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the lengths of the sticks.
   - This part is correct and matches the problem statement.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths**:
   - It uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each stick length.
   - This is correct and ensures that we know how many sticks of each length there are.

3. **Calculating the Number of Ways to Form a Triangle**:
   - The program iterates over the values in `num_of_lens` (the counts of each stick length).
   - If there are at least 3 sticks of the same length, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 out of these sticks using `math.comb(cnt, 3)`.
   - If there are at least 2 sticks of the same length, it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 out of these sticks and multiplies it by the sum of the counts of all other stick lengths (excluding the current length). This is done using `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Triangle Inequality Check**:
   - The problem requires forming a non-degenerate triangle, which means the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.
   - The program does not check this condition. It simply counts combinations without verifying if they can form a triangle.

2. **Combination Calculation**:
   - The combination calculations (`math.comb(cnt, 3)` and `math.comb(cnt, 2)`) are used to count the number of ways to choose sticks, but they do not account for the triangle inequality condition.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. It fails to ensure that the chosen sticks can actually form a non-degenerate triangle.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**
