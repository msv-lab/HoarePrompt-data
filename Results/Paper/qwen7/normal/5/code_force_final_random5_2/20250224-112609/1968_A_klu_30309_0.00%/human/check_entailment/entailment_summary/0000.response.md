Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \leq y < x \)) such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized. The provided solution iterates from \( x-1 \) down to 2 to find the largest \( y \) that divides \( x \) and satisfies \( 2y \geq x \).

2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` starts by initializing `max_val` to 1.
   - It then iterates over all integers from \( x-1 \) down to 2.
   - For each \( y \), it checks if \( x \) is divisible by \( y \) (`x % y == 0`).
   - If \( x \) is divisible by \( y \) and \( 2y \geq x \), it immediately returns \( y \).
   - If no such \( y \) is found, it returns the last value of `max_val`, which is set to the largest \( y \) that divides \( x \).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - For \( x = 2 \), the only possible \( y \) is 1, and \(\gcd(2, 1) + 1 = 2\).
   - For \( x > 2 \), the function correctly identifies the largest \( y \) such that \( x \) is divisible by \( y \) and \( 2y \geq x \).

4. **Validation**:
   - The logic ensures that \( y \) is chosen such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized.
   - The condition \( 2y \geq x \) ensures that \( y \) is not too small relative to \( x \).

Given the above points, the provided code correctly implements the logic to find the desired \( y \).

Correctness: **True**
