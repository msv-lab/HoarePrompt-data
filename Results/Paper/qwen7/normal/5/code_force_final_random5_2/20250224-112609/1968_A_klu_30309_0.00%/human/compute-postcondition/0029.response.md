Functionality: **The function accepts an integer x where 2 <= x <= 1000. It returns y if 2 * y is greater than or equal to x and x is divisible by y. If no such y exists, it returns y which is x - 2. If no such y exists, it returns y which is x - 3. Finally, if no such y exists, it returns max_val which is the largest value of y such that 1 < y < x and x % y == 0 and 2 * y >= x, or max_val remains 1 if no such y exists.**
