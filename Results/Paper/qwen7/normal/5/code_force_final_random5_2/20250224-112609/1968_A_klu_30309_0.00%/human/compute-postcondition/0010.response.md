Output State: **`max_val` is `x - 1`, `x` is greater than 1, `y` is `x - 1`, and the current value of `x` is divisible by `y`, and `2 * y` is less than `x`.**

Explanation: The code sets `max_val` to the value of `y`, which is `x - 1`. All other conditions and relationships between variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `max_val` is now `x - 1`, while `x` is still greater than 1, `y` is still `x - 1`, and the other conditions (`x` is divisible by `y`, and `2 * y` is less than `x`) still hold true.
