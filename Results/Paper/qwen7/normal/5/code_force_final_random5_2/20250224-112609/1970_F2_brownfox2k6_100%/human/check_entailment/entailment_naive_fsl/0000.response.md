Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not seem to handle the complete logic required for the problem description. Specifically, the functions do not handle the movement of players, catching balls, throwing Quaffles, scoring points, or eliminating players due to Bludgers. These functionalities are crucial for determining the outcome of the game as described in the problem statement. Without implementing these core functionalities, the program cannot accurately simulate the game and determine the winner based on the rules provided. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
