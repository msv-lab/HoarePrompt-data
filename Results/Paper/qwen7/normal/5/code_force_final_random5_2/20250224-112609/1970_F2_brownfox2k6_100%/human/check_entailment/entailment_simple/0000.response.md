Reasoning:
1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**: The program correctly parses the input to initialize the field, including players, goals, the Quaffle, and the Bludger. The positions are stored appropriately in lists and dictionaries.
2. **Action Handling**: The program handles the actions correctly. It updates the positions of players and the Quaffle based on the specified movements. The conditions for catching and throwing the Quaffle are also handled correctly.
3. **Elimination Check**: The function `func_2` checks for players that are in the same position as the Bludger and prints them as eliminated. The logic for updating the player positions to `[-1, -1]` when eliminated is correct.
4. **Scoring Logic**: The program correctly increments the scores for the respective teams when a player successfully scores in the opponent's goal. The Quaffle is moved to the center of the field after scoring.
5. **Final Score Output**: The final score is correctly printed at the end of the game.

Given the above points, the program appears to handle all aspects of the problem description correctly.

Correctness: **True**
