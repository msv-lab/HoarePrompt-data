Output State: **`i` is -1, `a` is a list starting with 1000 followed by elements calculated from `T`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `line` is the user-inputted string converted to a list of integers.**

Explanation: The code `T = list(map(int, line.split()))` converts the user-inputted string `line` into a list of integers using the `split()` function to split the string into individual elements and `map(int, ...)` to convert each element into an integer. This operation does not affect the values of `i`, `a`, `result`, `t`, or `n`. The only change is that `line` is now a list of integers.
