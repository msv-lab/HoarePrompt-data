Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial state.**

This means that `t` now holds the value entered by the user, ensuring it is within the specified range. The values of `n` and `x` remain as they were in the initial state, meaning `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and `x` is a list of n-1 integers where 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500 for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n.
