Output State: `i` is `-1`, `a` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the first `n` elements of `T`, starting from the first element.

To understand this, let's break down the loop and its effect on the list `a`:

1. Initially, `a = [1000]`.
2. The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`. For each iteration, it appends to `a` the value of the previous element in `a` plus the corresponding element in `T`.

After the loop completes, `a` will contain `n` elements, where each element (except the first one) is the sum of all previous elements in `T` up to that point. Specifically, the last element of `a` will be the sum of all elements in `T`.

Since the loop increments `i` from `1` to `n-1`, once the loop finishes, `i` will be set to `-1` as per the loop termination condition. The list `a` will have been fully populated with the required cumulative sums.
