Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `a` has an additional element which is equal to `a[0] + T[0]`.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])` appends to the list `a` the value of `a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `i - 1` is 0. Therefore, the new element appended to `a` is `a[0] + T[0]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
