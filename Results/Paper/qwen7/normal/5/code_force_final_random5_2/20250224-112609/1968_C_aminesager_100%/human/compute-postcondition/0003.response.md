Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `n` now holds the integer value entered by the user. The variable `t` remains unchanged as the input does not affect its value.
