Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each test case, a, b, and m are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^{18}; A and B are calculated as A=int(m/a)+1 and B=int(m/b)+1 respectively, and the sum A+B is printed for each test case.**

Explanation: The code reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`. It calculates `A` and `B` using the formulas `A=int(m/a)+1` and `B=int(m/b)+1`, and prints the sum `A+B`. However, since the actual values of `a`, `b`, `m`, `A`, and `B` are not provided, they remain undefined in the output state. The only changes are the definitions of `A` and `B` based on the given formulas, and the fact that the code will perform these operations for each test case.
