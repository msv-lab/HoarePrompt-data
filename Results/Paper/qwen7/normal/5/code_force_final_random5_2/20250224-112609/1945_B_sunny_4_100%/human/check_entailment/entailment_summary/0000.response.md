Reasoning:
The provided program aims to calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible in the sky at the same time. The formula used in the program is \( \text{m} // a + \text{m} // b + 2 \). Let's break down the logic:

1. **Understanding the Formula**:
   - \( \text{m} // a \) gives the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the visibility period of \( m \) minutes.
   - \( \text{m} // b \) gives the number of fireworks launched by the second installation within the visibility period of \( m \) minutes.
   - Adding 2 accounts for the fact that there can be an overlap of fireworks from both installations at the end of the visibility period.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - When \( a \) and \( b \) are relatively prime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1), the formula correctly counts the overlaps.
   - However, the formula might overcount if there are common multiples of \( a \) and \( b \) within the visibility period.

3. **Verification**:
   - The provided example in the execution summary shows that the program correctly handles the edge cases and general cases.
   - For instance, in the first test case (6 7 4), the result is 2, which is correct because the first and second installations' fireworks do not overlap within the 5-minute visibility period.
   - In the third test case (7 8 56), the result is 17, which is also correct based on the given explanation.

Given the analysis and the examples provided in the execution summary, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
