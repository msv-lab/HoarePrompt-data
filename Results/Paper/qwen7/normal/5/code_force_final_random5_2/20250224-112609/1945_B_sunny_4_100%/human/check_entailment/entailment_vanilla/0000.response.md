Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. This involves understanding the timing of the fireworks from both installations and their visibility period.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` which represent the frequency of launching for the first and second installations, and the visibility period of the fireworks, respectively.
   - The formula used to calculate the number of fireworks visible simultaneously is `ans = m // a + m // b + 2`.

3. **Correctness of the Formula**:
   - `m // a` gives the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the visibility period `m`.
   - `m // b` gives the number of fireworks launched by the second installation within the visibility period `m`.
   - Adding `2` accounts for the possibility of fireworks being launched at the exact start (`0`) and end (`m`) of the visibility period, ensuring these are counted.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The formula handles edge cases where the exact start and end times are included.
   - The use of integer division (`//`) ensures we get the correct count of whole intervals.

5. **Comparison with Example Outputs**:
   - The example outputs match the expected results when applying the given formula.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously.

Correctness: **True**
