Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously. According to the problem description, the formula `A + B` should be used to calculate the number of fireworks from each installation that are visible at the same time, but the program incorrectly uses `A + B + 2`.

The correct approach should be:
- Calculate how many fireworks from the first installation (`A`) are visible within the time frame `[0, m]`.
- Calculate how many fireworks from the second installation (`B`) are visible within the same time frame.
- The maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously would be `min(A, B)` because both installations cannot launch fireworks at the exact same time.

However, the given program calculates `A + B + 2`, which is incorrect. For example, consider the input `6 7 4`:
- The first installation launches fireworks at times `[0, 6, 12, 18, ...]`.
- The second installation launches fireworks at times `[0, 7, 14, 21, ...]`.
- Within the time frame `[0, 4]`, only the first installation launches one firework, and the second installation does not launch any fireworks. Therefore, the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously is `1`.

The program incorrectly prints `2` instead of `1`. This is a clear indication that the program does not meet the problem description for every potential case.
