### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the given program.

#### Problem Description:
- We need to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.
- Each installation launches fireworks at regular intervals.
- Fireworks are visible for `m + 1` minutes after launch.
- We need to calculate the maximum overlap of visible fireworks from both installations.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for qi in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        ans = m // a + m // b + 2
        print(ans)
```

#### Annotated Code:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`.
- It calculates `ans` as `m // a + m // b + 2`.
- It prints `ans`.

#### Analysis:
1. **Calculation of Visible Fireworks:**
   - `m // a` gives the number of fireworks from the first installation that are visible within the time frame `[0, m]`.
   - `m // b` gives the number of fireworks from the second installation that are visible within the same time frame.
   - The sum `m // a + m // b` gives the total number of fireworks from both installations that are visible at some point within `[0, m]`.
   - Adding `2` to this sum is incorrect because it doesn't account for the overlap correctly.

2. **Overlap Calculation:**
   - To find the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.
   - The LCM of `a` and `b` gives the interval at which both installations might launch fireworks at the same time.
   - We need to count the number of multiples of the LCM within the time frame `[0, m]` and adjust accordingly.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - Calculate the number of fireworks from each installation within `[0, m]`.
   - Find the LCM of `a` and `b`.
   - Count the number of multiples of the LCM within `[0, m]`.
   - Adjust the counts to avoid double-counting the simultaneous launches.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is correct. The program incorrectly calculates the number of visible fireworks by simply adding the individual counts without considering the overlap. The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` is incorrect and leads to overestimation in many cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not properly account for the overlap of fireworks from both installations.
