Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `qi` is 0.
- `a` is an integer from the input.
- `b` is an integer from the input.
- `m` is an integer from the input.
- `ans` is calculated as `m // a + m // b + 2`.

The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the result of the formula `m // a + m // b + 2`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are not specified, we can only describe `ans` in terms of these variables.

Output: **m // a + m // b + 2**
