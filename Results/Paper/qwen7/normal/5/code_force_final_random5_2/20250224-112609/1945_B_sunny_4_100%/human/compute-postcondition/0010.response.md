Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `qi` is 1.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `ans` is calculated as `m // a + m // b + 2`.

The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the sum of the integer division of `m` by `a`, the integer division of `m` by `b`, and 2.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **m // a + m // b + 2**
