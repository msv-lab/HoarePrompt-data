Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 10^4, `qi` is 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input**.

This means that the initial value of `t` remains unchanged, `qi` remains 0, and now three new integers `a`, `b`, and `m` have been assigned values from the input split into a list and unpacked into these variables.
