Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `qi` is 10000 (or the final value of `t` after all iterations), `a` is an input integer from one of the iterations, `b` is an input integer from one of the iterations, `m` is an input integer from one of the iterations, `ans` is the final value of `m // a + m // b + 2` calculated in the last iteration.

In this final state, `qi` will have reached its maximum possible value of `t` (which is at most 10^4), and `a`, `b`, and `m` will hold the values from the last iteration of the loop. The variable `ans` will contain the result of the expression `m // a + m // b + 2` evaluated for the last set of inputs provided.
