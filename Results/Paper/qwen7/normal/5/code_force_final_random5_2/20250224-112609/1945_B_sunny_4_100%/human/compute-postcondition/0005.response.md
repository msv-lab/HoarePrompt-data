Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `qi` is 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `m` is an integer from the input, `ans` is `m // a + m // b + 2`**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `m // a + m // b + 2`. The other variables (`t`, `qi`, `a`, `b`, `m`) remain unchanged. The output state includes all the original conditions and the new value of `ans`.
