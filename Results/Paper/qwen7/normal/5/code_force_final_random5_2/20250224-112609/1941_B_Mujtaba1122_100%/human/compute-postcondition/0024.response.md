To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head:

```
while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):
```

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
- `list[i]` is now 2
- `list[i - 1]` is -1 * `list[i - 1]`
- `list[i + 1]` remains greater than 0

For the loop to execute one more time, all the conditions in the loop head must be true. Let's analyze each condition:

1. **Condition 1:** `list[i] > 1`
   - Currently, `list[i]` is 2, which satisfies this condition.

2. **Condition 2:** `list[i - 1] > 0`
   - Currently, `list[i - 1]` is -1 * `list[i - 1]`. This implies that `list[i - 1]` is now negative (since multiplying a number by -1 makes it negative). Therefore, this condition is not satisfied.

3. **Condition 3:** `list[i + 1] > 0`
   - Currently, `list[i + 1]` remains greater than 0, which satisfies this condition.

Since the second condition (`list[i - 1] > 0`) is not satisfied, we need to adjust the state of `list[i - 1]` so that it becomes positive.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `list[i - 1]` must be greater than 0.

State: **`list[i]` is now 2, `list[i - 1]` must be greater than 0, `list[i + 1]` remains greater than 0**
