Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Conditions**: The loop condition is given as `list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0)`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `list[i - 1]` is `0`, and the conditions `list[i] > -1`, `list[i - 1] > 0`, and `list[i + 1] > 1` still hold for the rest of the list.

To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that all conditions in the loop head are satisfied.

- **Condition 1**: `list[i] > 1` - This condition is already satisfied because it was mentioned that `list[i] > -1` and no information suggests otherwise.
- **Condition 2**: `list[i - 1] > 0` - This condition is not satisfied because `list[i - 1]` is `0` at the end of the previous iteration.
- **Condition 3**: `list[i + 1] > 0` - This condition is already satisfied because it was mentioned that `list[i + 1] > 1` and `1 > 0`.

Since `list[i - 1] > 0` is not satisfied, we need to adjust this state.

**Conclusion**: We need to adjust `list[i - 1]` to be greater than `0` for the loop to execute one more time.

**State**: **`list[i - 1]` must be greater than 0**
