Output State: **`list[i]` must be greater than 1, `list[i - 1]` is 0, `list[i + 1]` is reduced by `list[i - 1]` which is 0, so `list[i + 1]` remains greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code subtracts `1 * list[i - 1]` from `list[i + 1]`. Given that `list[i - 1]` is 0, the operation effectively does not change the value of `list[i + 1]`, which was already greater than 0. Therefore, the condition that `list[i + 1]` must be greater than 0 remains true. The other conditions (`list[i]` must be greater than 1 and `list[i - 1]` is 0) also remain unchanged.
