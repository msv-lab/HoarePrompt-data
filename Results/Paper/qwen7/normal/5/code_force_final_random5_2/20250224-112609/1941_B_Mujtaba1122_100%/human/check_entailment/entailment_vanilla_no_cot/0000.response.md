Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations. Here's why:

1. **Function `func_2` Logic Issue**: The function `func_2` attempts to reduce the elements of the array by repeatedly applying the operation. However, the way the operation is applied and the conditions under which it is applied are flawed. Specifically, the operation should only be applied when `list[i] > 1`, `list[i-1] > 0`, and `list[i+1] > 0`. The current implementation subtracts `list[i-1]` from `list[i+1]` and `list[i]` without checking if these subtractions would result in non-positive values, which could lead to incorrect results.

2. **Printing 'NO' Prematurely**: The function prints 'NO' prematurely if `list[i-1] != 0` after performing an operation, which is not the correct approach. Instead, it should continue processing until no further operations can be performed or until all elements are zero.

3. **Final Check with `func_1`**: The final check using `func_1` is necessary but should be done after all possible operations have been attempted. If the loop in `func_2` completes without printing 'NO', then `func_1` should be called to verify if all elements are zero.

A corrected version of the code should ensure that the operation is only applied when it is safe to do so and should properly handle the final check. Here is a revised version of the solution:

```python
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
    return True

def func_2(list, n):
    changed = True
    while changed:
        changed = False
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
                list[i + 1] -= 1
                list[i] -= 2
                list[i - 1] -= 1
                changed = True
    if func_1(list, n):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    t = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        func_2(a, n)
```

This revised code ensures that the operations are applied safely and checks the final state of the array correctly.
