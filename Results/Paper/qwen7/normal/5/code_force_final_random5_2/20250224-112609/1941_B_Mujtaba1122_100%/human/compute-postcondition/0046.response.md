Output State: **`list[i]` is decreased by 2 times `list[i - 1]`, and `list[i - 1]` must still be greater than 0**.

Explanation: The code `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]` updates the value of `list[i]` by subtracting twice the value of `list[i - 1]` from it. The condition that `list[i - 1]` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state of the list is as described.
