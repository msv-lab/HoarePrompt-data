Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables:**
   The loop condition is:
   ```
   while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):
   ```
   The variables involved in the loop head are:
   - `list[i]`
   - `list[i - 1]`
   - `list[i + 1]`

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `list[1]` is now `list[1] - 2 * list[0] - 1`
   - `list[2]` is greater than `2 * list[1] - 2 * list[0] - 1`
   - The length of the list `n` is such that `3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`.

3. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   For the loop to execute one more time, all conditions in the loop head must be true:
   - `list[i] > 1`
   - `list[i - 1] > 0`
   - `list[i + 1] > 0`

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `list[1]` is already updated, we need to ensure that `list[1] > 1`.
   - We need to ensure that `list[0]` is such that `list[1] = list[1] - 2 * list[0] - 1 > 1`.
   - We need to ensure that `list[2] > 0` because it is already given that `list[2] > 2 * list[1] - 2 * list[0] - 1` and `list[1] > 1`.
   - We need to ensure that `list[i - 1] > 0` and `list[i + 1] > 0` for the next index values.

Given these conditions, we need to adjust the states as follows:

- Ensure `list[1] > 1`.
- Ensure `list[0]` is such that `list[1] = list[1] - 2 * list[0] - 1 > 1`.
- Ensure `list[2] > 0`.

Since `list[2]` is already greater than `2 * list[1] - 2 * list[0] - 1` and `list[1] > 1`, we don't need to change `list[2]`.

### Final State Adjustment:

State: **`list[1]` must be greater than 1, `list[0]` must be such that `list[1] = list[1] - 2 * list[0] - 1 > 1`, and `list[2]` must be greater than 0**.
