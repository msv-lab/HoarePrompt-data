Based on the initial state provided, the precondition indicates that the list `list` contains elements that are either 0 or negative, and specifically, `list[i - 1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i + 1]` are all 0. The loop terminates because none of the conditions inside the while loop are satisfied, meaning all relevant elements in the list have been reduced to 0 or below. The function `func_1(list, n)` returns `True`.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
