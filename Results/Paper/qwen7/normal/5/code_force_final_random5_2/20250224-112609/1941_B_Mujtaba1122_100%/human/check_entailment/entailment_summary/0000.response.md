### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if Rudolf can make all elements of the array equal to zero using the specified operation.
   - The operation involves selecting an index \(i\) (where \(2 \leq i \leq n-1\)) and performing the following assignments:
     - \(a_{i-1} = a_{i-1} - 1\)
     - \(a_i = a_i - 2\)
     - \(a_{i+1} = a_{i+1} - 1\)

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(list, n)`**: This function checks if all elements in the list are zero. If any element is non-zero, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.
   - **`func_2(list, n)`**: This function processes the list by repeatedly applying the operation described above. It ensures that for each index \(i\) (from 2 to \(n-1\)), the conditions \(a[i] > 1\), \(a[i-1] > 0\), and \(a[i+1] > 0\) are met before performing the operation. After processing, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero and prints the appropriate result ('YES' or 'NO').

3. **Behavior of `func_2`:**
   - The function iterates through the list and applies the operation as long as the conditions are satisfied. This ensures that the values are reduced in a way that maintains the invariant that the sum of the values remains unchanged.
   - After processing, if any element other than the first or last is non-zero, it prints 'NO'.
   - If all elements are zero after processing, it prints 'YES'.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly implements the described operation and checks if the array can be reduced to all zeros.
   - The function `func_1` correctly checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - Given the constraints and the nature of the operation, the approach in `func_2` ensures that if it is possible to reduce the array to all zeros, it will do so.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the provided functions correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
