### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` as soon as it finds a non-zero element.
   - If it completes the iteration without finding any non-zero element, it returns `True`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to reduce the elements of the list according to the specified operation.
   - It iterates through the list from index 1 to n-2.
   - For each index `i`, it performs the operation as long as the conditions `list[i] > 1`, `list[i - 1] > 0`, and `list[i + 1] > 0` are met.
   - After attempting to perform the operation, it checks if `list[i - 1]` is still non-zero. If so, it prints 'NO' and returns immediately.
   - If the loop completes without returning, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero.

3. **Main Program**:
   - The main program reads the input and calls `func_2` for each test case.
   - Based on the result of `func_2`, it prints 'YES' or 'NO'.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of `func_2`**:
  - The operation defined in `func_2` ensures that the sum of the elements in the list decreases by at least 3 in each step (since `a_{i-1}` is decreased by 1, `a_i` is decreased by 2, and `a_{i+1}` is decreased by 1).
  - If the list can be made entirely zero using these operations, `func_2` will correctly identify it and print 'YES'.
  - If the list cannot be made zero, `func_2` will correctly identify it and print 'NO'.

- **Correctness of `func_1`**:
  - `func_1` correctly checks if all elements in the list are zero and returns the appropriate boolean value.

- **Overall Correctness**:
  - The main program correctly calls `func_2` for each test case and prints the result based on the return value of `func_2`.
  - Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in `func_2`, the program should correctly determine whether it is possible to make all elements of the array zero.

### Conclusion:
The given program is designed to solve the problem correctly based on the provided logic and constraints.

**Correctness: **True**
