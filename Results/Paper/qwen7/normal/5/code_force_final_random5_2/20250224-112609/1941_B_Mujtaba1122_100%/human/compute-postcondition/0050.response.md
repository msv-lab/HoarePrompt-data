Output State: **`list[i]` is decreased by 2 times `list[i - 1]`, and `list[i + 1]` is decreased by `list[i - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]` updates the value of `list[i]` by subtracting twice the value of `list[i - 1]` from it. The values of `list[i - 1]` and `list[i + 1]` are also mentioned to be decreased by `list[i - 1]`, which means `list[i + 1] -= list[i - 1]`. However, since the code only directly modifies `list[i]`, the updated state of `list[i]` is explicitly stated, while the other conditions remain as they were initially described.
