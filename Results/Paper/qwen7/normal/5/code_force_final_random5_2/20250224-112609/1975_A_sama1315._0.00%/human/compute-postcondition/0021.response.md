Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is `index + 3 * n + 1`, `n` is `int(data[index])`, `arr` is a list of integers from `data[index:index + n]`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is `result`, `t` is `t - 2`**.

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`.
- The value of `index` is updated to `index + 3 * n + 1`.
- The list `arr` is updated to be a list of integers from `data[index:index + n]`.
- The variable `result` remains the return value of `func_1(arr)`.
- The list `results` remains a list with one additional element which is `result`.
- The value of `t` is updated to `t - 2`.
