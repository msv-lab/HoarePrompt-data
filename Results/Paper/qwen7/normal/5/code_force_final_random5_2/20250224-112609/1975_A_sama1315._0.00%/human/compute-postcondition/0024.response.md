Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is `index + 3 * n + 2 + n`, `n` is `int(data[index - 1])`, `arr` is updated to be `list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is `result`, `t` is `t - 2`**.

Explanation: The code `index += n` increments the value of `index` by `n`. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, the new value of `index` is the old value of `index` plus `n`. All other variables retain their previous values and states as described in the initial state.
