Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is index + 3 * n + 1, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index - n:index]`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is `result`, `n` is an integer obtained from `data[index - n - 1]`, `t` is t - 1, `arr` is updated to be a list of integers from `data[index:index + n]`**.

Explanation:
- The line `index += n` increments the value of `index` by `n`.
- The value of `index` was initially `index + 2 * n + 1`, so after adding `n`, it becomes `index + 3 * n + 1`.
- All other variables (`data`, `arr`, `result`, `results`, `n`, and `t`) remain unchanged in terms of their relationships to each other and their values, except that `index` is updated as described.
