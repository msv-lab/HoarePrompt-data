Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` sets of data. Each set consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the length of an array `a`, and then `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n) representing the elements of array `a`. The function processes each set and returns a result for each based on the given data.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case includes the length of an array and the array's elements. It processes these inputs and produces a result for each test case, though the specific result is not detailed here.
