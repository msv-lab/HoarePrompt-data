The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case includes an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, followed by `t` sets of data. Each set contains an integer `n` indicating the length of an array `a`, followed by `n` integers representing the elements of `a`. For each set, it calls another function `func_1` to process the array and collects the results. Finally, it prints the results of `func_1` for each test case, separated by new lines.
