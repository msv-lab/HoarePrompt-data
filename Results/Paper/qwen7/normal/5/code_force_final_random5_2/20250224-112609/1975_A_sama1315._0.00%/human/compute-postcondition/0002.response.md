Output State: **`index` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace.**

The code initializes the variable `index` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t` or `data`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions with `index` set to 0.
