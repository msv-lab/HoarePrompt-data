Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is index + 2*n, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index - n:index]`**.

Explanation: Initially, `index` is set to `index + 1 + n`. After executing `index += n`, the value of `index` is updated to `index + n + n`, which simplifies to `index + 2*n`. The value of `arr` is derived from the slice `data[index - n:index]`, and since no other operations affect `data` or `arr`, these remain unchanged except for the new value of `index`.
