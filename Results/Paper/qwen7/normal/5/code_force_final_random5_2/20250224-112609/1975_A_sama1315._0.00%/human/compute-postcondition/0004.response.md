Output State: **`index` is 2, `t` is an integer equal to `data[0]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string on whitespace.**

The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. Initially, `index` is 1, so after executing the code, `index` becomes 2. The values of `t` and `data` remain unchanged from their initial states.
