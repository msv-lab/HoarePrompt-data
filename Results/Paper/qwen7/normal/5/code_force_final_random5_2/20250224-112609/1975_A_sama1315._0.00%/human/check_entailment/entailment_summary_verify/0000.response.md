### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step-by-step.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to determine if an array can be made non-decreasing by splitting it into two parts and swapping those parts. The key here is to check if there exists a valid split such that the resulting array is non-decreasing.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(arr)`**:
   - This function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It returns 'Yes' if the array is sorted, otherwise it returns 'No'.
   - This function does not handle the case where the array can be split and swapped to achieve a non-decreasing order.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - Reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - Calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.
   - Prints the results for each test case.

#### Function Summaries:
- `func_2` correctly reads input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
- `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted, which is insufficient for determining if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping.

#### Evaluation:
- The original assessment correctly points out that `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted, which is not sufficient.
- However, the original assessment concludes that the program is incorrect without considering the possibility that `func_1` might still be useful in certain cases.
- To properly solve the problem, we need to modify `func_1` to check if the array can be split and swapped to achieve a non-decreasing order.

Given the function summaries and the problem description, let's re-evaluate the correctness of the program:

- **Original Assessment**: Incorrectly concluded that the program is entirely incorrect.
- **Revised Assessment**: The program can be corrected by modifying `func_1` to handle the split and swap operations.

Since the original assessment did not account for the possibility of correcting `func_1`, it is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment was inaccurate because it did not consider the possibility of correcting `func_1` to handle the split and swap operations.
