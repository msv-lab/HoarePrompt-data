Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is index + 3 * n + 1, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index - n:index]`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is `result`, `n` is an integer obtained from `data[index - n - 1]`, `t` is t - 1, `arr` is updated to be a list of integers from `data[index:index + n]`**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `result` by calling the function `func_1` on the list `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states. Specifically, `index` is updated to `index + 3 * n + 1`, `arr` is updated to be a list of integers from `data[index:index + n]`, and `results` gets an additional element which is the return value of `func_1(arr)`.
