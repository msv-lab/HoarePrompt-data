### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to check if an array can be made non-decreasing by splitting it into two parts and swapping them.
   - `func_1` checks if the array is already non-decreasing.
   - `func_2` reads input and processes multiple test cases using `func_1`.

2. **Analysis of `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
     - If all elements satisfy `arr[i] <= arr[i + 1]`, it returns 'Yes'.
     - Otherwise, it returns 'No' if there's at least one pair where `arr[i] > arr[i + 1]`.
   - This function does not handle the splitting and swapping operation; it only checks if the array is already sorted.

3. **Analysis of `func_2`:**
   - `func_2` reads input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It uses `func_1` to determine if each test case's array can be sorted by the described operation.
   - The logic in `func_2` seems correct for reading and processing multiple test cases.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The problem requires checking if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping.
   - `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted, which is insufficient.
   - The problem description suggests that the array might need to be split and swapped, but `func_1` does not implement this logic.

5. **Review of Annotated Code:**
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state transitions and the logic flow.
   - However, the core issue remains that `func_1` does not handle the required operation of splitting and swapping to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing.

### Conclusion:
- `func_1` is incorrect because it only checks if the array is already sorted, not if it can be made sorted by splitting and swapping.
- `func_2` is also incorrect because it relies on `func_1`, which is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment was accurate. The program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. The function `func_1` fails to account for the required operation of splitting and swapping to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing.
