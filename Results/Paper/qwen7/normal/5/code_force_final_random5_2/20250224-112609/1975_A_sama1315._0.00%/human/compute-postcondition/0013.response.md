Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop is defined as `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable involved in the loop head is `t`, but since `_` is used as a placeholder (a common practice when the loop variable is not needed), we focus on `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `data` is unchanged.
   - `index` is `index + 2 * n`.
   - `arr` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index - n:index]`.
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`.
   - `results` is a list with one additional element which is `result`.

4. **Adjusting the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `t > 0`, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1.
   - All other variables (`data`, `index`, `arr`, `result`, `results`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect `t` being decremented by 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is index + 2 * n, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from `data[index - n:index]`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(arr)`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is `result`, `t` is t - 1**
