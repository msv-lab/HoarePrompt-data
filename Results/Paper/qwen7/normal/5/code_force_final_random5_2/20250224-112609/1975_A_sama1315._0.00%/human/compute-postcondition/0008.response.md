Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is index + 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`.**

Explanation: The value of `index` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` is still the integer value of `data[index]` before the increment, but now `index` points to the next element in the list (or array) `data`.
