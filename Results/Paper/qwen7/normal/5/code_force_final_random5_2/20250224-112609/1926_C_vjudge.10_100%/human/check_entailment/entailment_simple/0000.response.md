Reasoning:
1. The program is designed to precompute the sum of the digits for each integer from 1 to 200000 and store these sums in the `values` array. This allows for quick lookups when processing test cases.
2. The `values` array is initialized with zeros and then updated iteratively. For each integer `i` from 1 to 200000, the sum of its digits is calculated and added to the cumulative sum stored in `values[i]`.
3. During the precomputation, `values[i]` holds the sum of the digits for all numbers from 1 to `i`. Therefore, `values[n]` directly gives the sum of the digits for all numbers from 1 to `n` for any `n` in the range 1 to 200000.
4. In the main loop, for each test case, the program simply prints the corresponding value from the `values` array, which correctly gives the sum of the digits for all numbers from 1 to `n`.

Given this analysis, the logic of the program is sound and it correctly computes the required sum for each test case using the precomputed values.

Correctness: **True**
