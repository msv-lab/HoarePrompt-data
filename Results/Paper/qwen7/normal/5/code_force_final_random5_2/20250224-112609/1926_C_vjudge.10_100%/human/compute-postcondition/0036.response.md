Output State: **`i` is a positive integer + 1, `x` is the last digit of the final string representation of `i`, `sum_value_digits` is the sum of all digits in the string representation of `i`, `values[i + 1]` is `values[i] + sum_value_digits`**.

This means that `i` has been incremented by 1 from its previous state, and now retains the properties of being a positive integer. The variable `x` now holds the last digit of the current value of `i`. The variable `sum_value_digits` contains the sum of all digits in the complete string representation of the current value of `i`. Lastly, `values[i + 1]` has been updated to reflect the addition of `sum_value_digits` to its previous value, as determined by the loop's cumulative effect on all iterations.
