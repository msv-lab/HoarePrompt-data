Output State: **`i` is a positive integer (i + 1), `sum_value_digits` is 0, and `values[i + 1]` is equal to `values[i] + sum_value_digits`**.

Explanation: The code sets `sum_value_digits` to 0, which overwrites its previous value. The other variables (`i`, `sum_value_digits`, and `values[i + 1]`) retain their previous relationships and values.
