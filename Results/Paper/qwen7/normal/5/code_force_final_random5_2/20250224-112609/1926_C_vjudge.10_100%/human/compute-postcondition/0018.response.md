Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop is defined as follows:
   ```python
   for x in str(i):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```
   The variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `i`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`. Each iteration extracts a digit from `i` and assigns it to `x`.

3. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `i` is a positive integer.
   - `x` is the first digit of `i`.
   - `sum_value_digits` is the original value of `sum_value_digits` plus the integer value of `x`.

4. **Analyze the Next Iteration**:
   - In the next iteration, `x` will be the next digit in the string representation of `i`.
   - Since `x` is derived from `i`, `i` itself does not change within the loop.

5. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - `i` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `x` will be the next digit in the string representation of `i`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the next digit being processed.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is a positive integer, `x` is the next digit of `i`, `sum_value_digits` is the original value of `sum_value_digits` plus the integer value of `x`**
