Reasoning:
The provided program aims to calculate the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to \( n \) for multiple test cases. It precomputes the cumulative sum of the digit sums for all numbers up to 200,000 and stores these values in the `values` array. This allows for quick retrieval of the required sum for any \( n \) within the specified range.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:
1. The function initializes an array `values` to store the cumulative sum of digit sums up to each index.
2. It iterates through all numbers from 1 to 200,000, calculating the sum of digits for each number and updating the `values` array accordingly.
3. For each test case, it retrieves the precomputed value from the `values` array and prints it.

However, there is a critical issue with the approach:
- The problem specifies that the time limit is 0.5 seconds per test case, but the solution precomputes values up to 200,000, which might be too slow for large inputs due to the large number of operations involved in summing digits and updating the array.

Despite this, the logic itself is sound for the given constraints. The program correctly precomputes the required values and uses them efficiently to answer each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the provided code, the program is logically correct for the specified range and number of test cases.

Correctness: **True**
