Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the sum of the digits of each integer from 1 to \( n \) and then summing those results.
2. The provided program attempts to precompute the cumulative sum of digit sums for all integers up to \( 2 \times 10^5 \) and store these values in an array `values`.
3. For each test case, it uses the precomputed values to quickly find the required sum without recomputing the digit sums for each number up to \( n \).
4. The logic for computing the digit sum of each number and updating the cumulative sum is correct.
5. The input handling and output printing are also correctly implemented according to the problem statement.

Given the above points, the program appears to be designed correctly to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
