Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for x in str(i):`. Here, the variable `x` is iterating over each character in the string representation of `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the variables involved in the loop head**:
   - `i` is a positive integer + 1.
   - `x` is the last digit of `i + 1`.
   - `sum_value_digits` is 0.
   - `values[i + 1]` is `values[i] + sum_value_digits`.

3. **Understand what the loop does**:
   - The loop iterates over each character (digit) in the string representation of `i`.
   - For each iteration, `x` takes the value of one of the digits in `i`.

4. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - Since `x` is iterating over each digit in the string representation of `i`, the initial value of `i` should be such that its string representation contains at least one digit.
   - `sum_value_digits` and `values[i + 1]` are not directly relevant to the loop head, so they don't need to be adjusted.

5. **Formulate the final state**:
   - `i` must be a positive integer + 1, and its string representation must contain at least one digit.
   - `x` will take the value of each digit in the string representation of `i`.
   - `sum_value_digits` and `values[i + 1]` remain as given.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is a positive integer + 1 whose string representation contains at least one digit, `x` is the current digit being processed, `sum_value_digits` is 0, `values[i + 1]` is `values[i] + sum_value_digits`**.
