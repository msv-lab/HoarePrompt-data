To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the loop itself:

### Given Information:
- After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be 200001.
- `sum_value_digits` will be the sum of the digits of `i-1`, which means `sum_value_digits` will be the sum of the digits of 200000.
- `values[200001]` will be the cumulative sum of `sum_value_digits` for all integers from 1 to 200000.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The final value of `i` after all iterations is 200001.
   - This implies that `t` (the number of iterations) must be 200001.

2. **Variable `sum_value_digits`:**
   - `sum_value_digits` is calculated based on the value of `i-1` during each iteration.
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, `sum_value_digits` will be calculated for each integer from 1 to 200000.

3. **Variable `values[200001]`:**
   - `values[200001]` is the cumulative sum of `sum_value_digits` for all integers from 1 to 200000.
   - This means that after 200000 iterations, the cumulative sum is stored in `values[200001]`.

### Conclusion:
- The only variable in the loop head is `t`, which controls the number of iterations.
- Therefore, the state before the loop starts must ensure that `t` is set to 200001.

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` must be 200001**
