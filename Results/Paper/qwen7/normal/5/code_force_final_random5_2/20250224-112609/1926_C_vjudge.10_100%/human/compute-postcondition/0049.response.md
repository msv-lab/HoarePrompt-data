Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes an integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5. The function does not return any value explicitly mentioned in the given information.**

However, based on the constraints and the typical structure of such functions, it seems the function likely processes these values internally but does not return anything directly. If there were specific outputs for different conditions, those would need to be specified.
