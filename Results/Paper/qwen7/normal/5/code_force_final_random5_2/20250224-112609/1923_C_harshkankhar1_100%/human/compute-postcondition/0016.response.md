Output State: **`x` is an integer from the first input split, `y` is an integer from the second input split**.

This means that the code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `x` and `y` respectively. The initial state of other variables remains unchanged.
