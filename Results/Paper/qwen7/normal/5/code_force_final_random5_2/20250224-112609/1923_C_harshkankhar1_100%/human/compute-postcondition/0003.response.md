Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `i`, `n`, and the range function. Specifically, `i` is the loop variable that starts from 1 and goes up to `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 1 because the range function is defined as `range(1, n + 1)`. Therefore, `i` must be set to 1 at the start of the loop.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Check other variables**: The variables `t`, `q`, `a`, and `b` are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted based on the loop execution conditions.

Based on these steps, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`. Specifically, `i` should be 1, and `n` should be greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
