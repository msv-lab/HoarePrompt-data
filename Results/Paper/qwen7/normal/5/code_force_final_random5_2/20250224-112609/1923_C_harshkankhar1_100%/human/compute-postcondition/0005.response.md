Output State: **`i` is 1; `x` is 2; `b[1]` is 2**

Explanation: The code `b[i] = b[i - 1] + x` updates the list `b` at index `i` with the sum of the element at index `i-1` and `x`. Given `i` is 1 and `x` is 2, `b[1]` is set to `b[0] + 2`. Since the initial state does not provide the value of `b[0]`, we assume it to be 0 (as it's not defined otherwise). Therefore, `b[1]` becomes `0 + 2`, which is 2. The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged.
