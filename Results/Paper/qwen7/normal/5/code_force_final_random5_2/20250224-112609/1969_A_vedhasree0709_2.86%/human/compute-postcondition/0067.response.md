Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, and `n` is an input integer which is 1 or more.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (which must be an integer and 1 or more) to the variable `n`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states.
