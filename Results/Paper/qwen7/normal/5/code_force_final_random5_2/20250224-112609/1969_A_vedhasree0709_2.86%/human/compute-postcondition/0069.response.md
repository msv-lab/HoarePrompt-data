Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input string split and converted to integers, `n` is an input integer which is 1 or more.**

The code `i = 0` changes the value of `i` from its initial state of 2 to 0. The values of `j`, `l`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
