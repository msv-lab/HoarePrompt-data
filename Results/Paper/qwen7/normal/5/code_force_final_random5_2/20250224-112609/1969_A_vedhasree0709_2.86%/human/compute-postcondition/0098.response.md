Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing a set of test cases where each case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), and a list p of n integers (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct). For each test case, the function returns information based on the given inputs.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters t, n, and a list p. The function does not take any parameters itself but uses these parameters to determine and return some form of output based on the given constraints.
