Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues with the program:

1. **Logic for Checking Best Friends**: The current logic in the `while` loop checks if `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`, which is too specific and does not cover all cases where pairs of best friends exist.

2. **Handling All Test Cases**: The program only prints 2 if it finds a specific pair of indices that meet the condition, but this is not a general solution. It fails to handle cases where no such pair exists but still requires inviting at least 3 friends to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

3. **General Solution Requirement**: The problem requires finding the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. The provided code does not account for all possible configurations of best friends and does not guarantee the minimum number of invitations.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to consider all pairs of best friends and find the minimum set of invitations that ensures at least 2 friends come to the party. This involves checking all possible pairs and ensuring that the selected friends' best friends also receive invitations.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        invited = set()
        
        # Try to invite pairs of best friends
        for i in range(n):
            if l[i] != i + 1 and i + 1 not in invited and l[i] not in invited:
                invited.add(i + 1)
                invited.add(l[i])
        
        # If we have at least 2 friends invited, print the number of invitations
        if len(invited) >= 2:
            print(len(invited))
        else:
            # Otherwise, we need to invite at least 3 friends
            print(3)

func()
```

This approach ensures that all pairs of best friends are considered, and the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party is calculated correctly.
