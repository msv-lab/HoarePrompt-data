Output State: **`i` is equal to `n + 1`, `j` is 0, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user, converts it to an integer, and assigns it to the variable `n`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial state.
