Output State: `i` is 5, `j` is 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input string split and converted to integers.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` until it reaches `n`. Based on the given information, the loop breaks when `i` is 1 because the conditions `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1` are met. After breaking, `i` is incremented to 2 (though not printed as the loop condition checks up to `n-1`). The loop then continues with `i` being 2, 3, and 4, but does not meet the break condition again. When `i` becomes 5, the loop terminates since `i` exceeds `n-1`. Therefore, the final state has `i` as 5, `j` remains 1, and `l` retains its original state from the input.
