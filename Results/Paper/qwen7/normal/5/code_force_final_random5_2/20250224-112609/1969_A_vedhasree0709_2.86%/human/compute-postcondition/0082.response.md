Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input string split and converted to integers, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement. It does not change the values of the variables `i`, `j`, or `l`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain the same as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
