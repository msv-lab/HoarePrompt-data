Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 1, `l` is a list of integers obtained from the input string split and converted to integers, the current value of `l[i]` is 2, the current value of `l[i + 1]` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `j`, or `l`. It only indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such context is provided, we assume it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `l[i]` and `l[i + 1]` remain unchanged as they were not part of any operation in the given code snippet.
