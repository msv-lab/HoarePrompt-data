Reasoning:
1. The program reads the number of test cases `m` from the input.
2. It initializes an empty list `b` to store the results for each test case.
3. For each test case, it calls the `func_1()` function.
4. The `func_1()` function processes the input for each test case:
   - It reads the length `k` of the array and the array itself.
   - It converts the array elements into integers.
   - It iterates through the array and applies the specified operation to elements greater than 10, splitting them into their constituent digits and appending them to a new list `c`.
   - After processing all elements, it sorts the list `c`.
   - It checks if the sorted list `c` is equal to the original list `c` after applying the operation. If so, it appends 1 to the list `b`; otherwise, it appends 0.
5. After processing all test cases, the main loop prints 'YES' if the corresponding value in `b` is 1, indicating the array could be sorted, or 'NO' if the value is 0, indicating the array cannot be sorted.

Given the execution summary and the logic implemented in the code, the program correctly implements the required functionality to determine if it's possible to sort the array using the specified operations.

Correctness: **True**
