You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

    #State: Postcondition: `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `c` is a list containing all elements from the list `a` that meet the specified conditions, `n` is the length of `c`, and `c` is sorted in a specific order based on the conditions inside the loop.

    #State: Postcondition: `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `c` is a list containing all elements from the list `a` that meet the specified conditions, `n` is the length of `c`, `d` is a sorted version of `c`, and `b` now contains either the element `1` or `0` depending on whether `c` is already sorted or not.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99). For each test case, it filters the list a based on specific conditions, sorts the filtered list, and checks if the filtered list is already sorted. If the filtered list is sorted, it appends 1 to the list b; otherwise, it appends 0. The function does not return anything directly but updates the list b with the results.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
2. The main issues are:
   - The `func_1` function is not being called with the correct parameters.
   - The logic inside `func_1` is flawed. It does not properly handle the splitting of numbers into their constituent digits and checking if the resulting array can be sorted.
   - The program initializes an empty list `b` but does not append any values to it.
   - The program assumes `b` is populated with results from `func_1`, but since `func_1` is not called correctly, `b` remains empty.

Given these issues, the program will not produce the correct output for the given problem.
