Postcondition: **`i` is 2 or 3, `c` is a list that either contains the first three elements of `a` divided into `x` and `y` or the first two elements of `a` alone, `x` is the remainder of `a[i]` divided by 10, `y` is updated to `int(a[i] / 10)` if `i` is 2 and `a[i]` is greater than 10, `n` is either `n + 2` or `n + 1` depending on the value of `i` and whether `y` is greater than or equal to `c[n - 1]`, and `c` is updated to include `a[i]` if `i` is 3 and `n` is incremented by 1.**

This means that after the if-else block executes, `i` will be either 2 or 3, `c` will be a list containing either the first two or three elements of `a` (divided into `x` and `y`), `x` will be the remainder of `a[i]` when divided by 10, `y` will be the quotient of `a[i]` divided by 10, and `y` will be updated accordingly if `a[i]` is greater than 10. Depending on the value of `i` and the comparison with the previous elements in `c`, `n` will be incremented by 1 or 2, and `c` will be updated to include `a[i]` if `i` is 3.
