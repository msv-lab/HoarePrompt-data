Postcondition: `i` is either 1 or 2, `c` is a list that either contains the first element of `a` divided into `x` and `y` or the first element of `a` alone, `x` is the remainder of `a[0]` divided by 10, `y` is `a[0]` // 10, and `n` is updated based on the following rules:
- If `a[i] > 10` and `i > 0`, then `y` is updated to `int(a[1] / 10)`, and `n` is either `n + 2` or `n + 1` depending on whether `y` is greater than or equal to `c[n - 1]`.
- If `a[i] <= 10` and `i == 0`, then the second element of `a` is appended to `c`, and `n` is `n + 1` if `i` equals 0 and `a[i]` is not greater than 10, otherwise `x` is the remainder of `a[0]` divided by 10, `y` is assigned the value of `int(a[1] / 10)`, and `n` is `n + 2` if `y` is less than or equal to `x`, otherwise `n` is 1 more than its original value.
