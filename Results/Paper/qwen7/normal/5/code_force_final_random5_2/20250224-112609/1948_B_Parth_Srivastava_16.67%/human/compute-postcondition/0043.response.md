Output State: **`i` is 0; `c` is a list with the first element of `a` appended to it; `n` is an input integer + 1.**

Explanation: The code `n = n + 1` increments the value of `n` by 1. However, since the initial state does not specify what `n` is (it only mentions `i` and `c`), we can only say that `n` is now one more than its original value. The values of `i` and `c` remain unchanged from their initial states.
