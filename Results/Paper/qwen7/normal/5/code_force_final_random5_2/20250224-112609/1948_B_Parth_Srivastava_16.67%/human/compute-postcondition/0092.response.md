Postcondition: **`i` is 2 or 3; `x` is the remainder of `a[i]` divided by 10; `y` is `int(a[i] / 10)`. Depending on the condition `y <= x`, `n` is either `n + 2` or `n + 1`. If `y <= x`, `c` is a list with an additional element `x` appended to it. Otherwise, `c` is appended with `a[i]` and `n` is increased by 1.**
