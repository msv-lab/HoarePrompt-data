Postcondition: **`i` is 2 or 3, `c` is a list containing the first three elements of `a` if `i` is 3 or the first two elements if `i` is 2, `x` is the remainder of `a[i]` divided by 10, `y` is `int(a[i] / 10)`, `y` is updated to `int(a[1] / 10)` if `i` is 2 and `a[1]` is greater than 10, `n` is either `n + 2` or `n + 1` depending on the value of `i` and whether `y` is greater than or equal to `c[n - 1]`.**
