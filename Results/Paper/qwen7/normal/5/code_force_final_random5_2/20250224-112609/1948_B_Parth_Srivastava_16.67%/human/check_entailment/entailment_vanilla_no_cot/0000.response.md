Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Initialization of `b` List**: The list `b` is not initialized before use. This will lead to undefined behavior when checking its values.
2. **Incorrect Function Call**: The function `func_1()` is called inside the loop without any logic to process the input data. This means the function is never actually called with the correct input.
3. **Logic in `func_1()`**: The logic in `func_1()` is flawed. It attempts to split numbers greater than 10 into their digits but does not properly handle the transformation and sorting logic required to determine if the array can be sorted.
4. **Sorting Logic**: The sorting logic within `func_1()` is incomplete and does not fully address the problem requirements. Specifically, it does not check if the transformed array can be sorted into non-decreasing order.
5. **Output Logic**: The output logic is also flawed. It checks the value of `b[i]` without ensuring that `b` has been populated correctly.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to:
- Properly initialize and populate the `b` list.
- Correctly implement the logic to transform the array elements as described.
- Check if the transformed array can be sorted into non-decreasing order.
- Output the correct result for each test case.
