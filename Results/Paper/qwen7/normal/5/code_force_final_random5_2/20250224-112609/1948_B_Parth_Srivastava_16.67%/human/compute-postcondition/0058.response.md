Postcondition: `i` is 1 or 2, `c` is a list that either contains the first element of `a` divided into `x` and `y` or the first element of `a` alone, `x` is the remainder of `a[0]` divided by 10, `y` is `a[0]` // 10, `y` is updated to `int(a[1] / 10)`, and `n` is either `n + 2` or `n + 1` depending on the value of `i`, if `y` is greater than or equal to `c[n - 1]`.
