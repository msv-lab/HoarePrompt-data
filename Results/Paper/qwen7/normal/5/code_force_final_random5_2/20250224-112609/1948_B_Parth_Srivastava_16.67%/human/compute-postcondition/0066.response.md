Postcondition: `i` is either 1 or 2, `c` is a list that either contains the first element of `a` divided into `y` and `x` or the first element of `a` alone, followed by additional elements as per the condition, and `n` is adjusted based on the condition: if `y <= x`, then `c` contains an additional element `x` and `n` is `n + 2`; otherwise, the second element of `a` is appended to `c` and `n` is incremented by 1.
