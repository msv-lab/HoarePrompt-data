Postcondition: `i` is 2, `c` is a list that either contains the first element of `a` divided into `y` and `x` (where `x` is the remainder of `a[0]` divided by 10 and `y` is `a[0]` // 10) or the first element of `a` alone, and the second element of `a` is appended to `c`; `n` is `n + 1` if `i` equals 0 and `a[i]` is not greater than 10, otherwise `x` is the remainder of `a[0]` divided by 10, `y` is assigned the value of `int(a[1] / 10)`, and `n` is `n + 2` if `y` is less than or equal to `x`, otherwise `n` is 1 more than its original value.
