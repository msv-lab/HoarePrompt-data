Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99). For each test case, it filters the list a based on specific conditions, sorts the filtered list, and checks if the filtered list is already sorted. If the filtered list is sorted, it appends 1 to the list b; otherwise, it appends 0. The function does not return anything directly but updates the list b with the results.**
