Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, a.split()))` splits the string `a` into a list of substrings based on whitespace, and then converts each substring to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. This changes the type of `a` from a string to a list of integers. The values of `t` and `k` remain unchanged.
