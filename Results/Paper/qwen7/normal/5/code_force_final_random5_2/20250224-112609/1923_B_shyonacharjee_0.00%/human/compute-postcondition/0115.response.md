Output State: **`success` remains `False`, `i` is `n`, `position` is `monsters[i][0]`, `health` is `monsters[i][1]`, `distance` is `abs(monsters[i][0])`, `time_available` is `abs(monsters[i][0])`, `bullets_needed` is `monsters[i][1]`, `total_bullets_used` is `total_bullets_used + monsters[n][1] + monsters[i][1] - bullets_needed`**.

Explanation: The line `total_bullets_used += bullets_needed` increments the value of `total_bullets_used` by the value of `bullets_needed`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
