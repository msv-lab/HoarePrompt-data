Output State: **`total_bullets_used` is incremented by `health`, `position` is the position of the second last monster in the `monsters` list, `health` is the health of the second last monster in the `monsters` list, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is equal to the absolute value of `position`, `i` is 4, `success` is False, `position` is assigned the value of `monsters[4][0]`, `health` is assigned the value of `monsters[4][1]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `health` to `bullets_needed`. Since `health` is the health of the second last monster in the `monsters` list, `bullets_needed` is now also equal to `health`. The `total_bullets_used` is incremented by this new value of `bullets_needed`, which means it is incremented by `health`. All other variables remain unchanged.
