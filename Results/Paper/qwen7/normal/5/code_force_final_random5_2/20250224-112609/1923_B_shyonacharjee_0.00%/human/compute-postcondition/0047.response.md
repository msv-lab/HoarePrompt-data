Output State: **`success` is True, `total_bullets_used` is equal to the sum of the health of all monsters in the `monsters` list, `positions` is updated to a list of integers obtained from input, `healths` is a list of integers converted from input, `monsters` is a list of tuples (position, health) sorted by the absolute value of the position, `n` is updated to the integer value of the first input, `k` is updated to the integer value of the second input, `i` is `n-2`, `position` is the position of the second last monster in the `monsters` list, `health` is the health of the second last monster in the `monsters` list, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the second last monster in the `monsters` list, and `time_available` is equal to the absolute value of the position of the second last monster in the `monsters` list; `total_bullets_used` is set to 0.**

Explanation: The line `success = True` sets the variable `success` to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
