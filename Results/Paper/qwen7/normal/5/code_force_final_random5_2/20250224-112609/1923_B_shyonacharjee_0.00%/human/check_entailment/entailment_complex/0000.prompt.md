Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    -1 2 3

    5 3
    
    2 1 3 2 5
    
    -3 -2 3 4 5
    
    2 1
    
    1 2
    
    1 2

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

# Annotated Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^9. Additionally, there are two lists of integers a and x, where a contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and x contains n integers such that -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        healths = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        positions = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        monsters = sorted(zip(positions, healths), key=lambda x: abs(x[0]))
        
        total_bullets_used = 0
        
        success = True
        
        for i in range(n):
            position, health = monsters[i]
            distance = abs(position)
            time_available = distance
            bullets_needed = health
            if total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available:
                success = False
                break
            total_bullets_used += bullets_needed
        
        print('YES' if success else 'NO')
        
    #State: Output State: `success` is `False`, `i` is `n`, `position` is `monsters[n][0]`, `health` is `monsters[n][1]`, `distance` is `abs(monsters[n][0])`, `time_available` is `abs(monsters[n][0])`, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of all `health` values in the `monsters` list.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the loop condition `for i in range(n)` ensures that the loop runs exactly `n` times. Given that the loop sets `success` to `False` as soon as the condition `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available` is met, and this condition is met before the loop completes all iterations, `success` remains `False`. At the end of the loop, the variable `i` will be `n`, indicating that all `n` iterations have been completed. The last executed monster's details (`position`, `health`, `distance`, `time_available`) are those of the last monster in the `monsters` list, which is `monsters[n-1]`. However, since array indices start from 0, `monsters[n][0]` and `monsters[n][1]` refer to the position and health of the last monster respectively. The `total_bullets_used` is the cumulative sum of all `health` values of the monsters because the loop adds each `bullets_needed` (which is equal to `health`) to `total_bullets_used` without any reduction.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each involving a number of monsters with given positions and health points. For each test case, it calculates whether it is possible to defeat all monsters using a limited number of bullets, based on their positions and health. If it is possible to defeat all monsters within the given constraints, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but outputs the result for each test case.
