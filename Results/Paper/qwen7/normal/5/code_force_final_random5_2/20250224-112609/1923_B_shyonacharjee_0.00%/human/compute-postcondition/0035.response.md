Postcondition: `success` remains False, `total_bullets_used` is `bullets_needed` + `bullets_needed`, `bullets_needed` is equal to the health of the monster at index 3 in the `monsters` list, `time_available` is equal to the absolute value of the position of the monster at index 0 in the `monsters` list, `position` is the position of the monster at index 3 in the `monsters` list, `health` is the health of the monster at index 3 in the `monsters` list, `distance` is the absolute value of the position of the monster at index 0 in the `monsters` list, and `i` is 3. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
