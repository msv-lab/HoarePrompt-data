Postcondition: `success` remains False, `bullets_needed` is equal to `health`, `distance` is the absolute value of `position`, `time_available` is equal to `distance`, `i` is 5, `total_bullets_used` is increased by `bullets_needed`, `position` is the position of the second last monster in the `monsters` list, `health` is the health of the second last monster in the `monsters` list, and either we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available`, or nothing changes if the condition is not met.
