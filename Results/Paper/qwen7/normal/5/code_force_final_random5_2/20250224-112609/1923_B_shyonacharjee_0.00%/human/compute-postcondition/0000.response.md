Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^9. Additionally, there are two lists of integers a and x, where a contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and x contains n integers such that -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The values of `n`, `k`, the lists `a` and `x` remain unchanged as they are not referenced in the given code snippet. The precondition that `t` is an integer within the specified range remains valid, and the structure of the problem for the subsequent test cases is maintained.
