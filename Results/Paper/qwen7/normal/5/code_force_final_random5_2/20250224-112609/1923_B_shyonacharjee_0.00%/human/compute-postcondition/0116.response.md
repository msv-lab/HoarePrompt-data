Output State: `success` is `False`, `i` is `n`, `position` is `monsters[n][0]`, `health` is `monsters[n][1]`, `distance` is `abs(monsters[n][0])`, `time_available` is `abs(monsters[n][0])`, `bullets_needed` is `monsters[n][1]`, `total_bullets_used` is the sum of `total_bullets_used` and the health of all monsters from `monsters[0]` to `monsters[n]`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the loop condition `i < n` will no longer be satisfied since `i` becomes equal to `n`. The variable `success` remains `False` because it was set to `False` during one of the loop iterations. The variable `i` is set to `n` as the loop increments `i` until it reaches `n`. The `position` and `health` are from the last monster in the `monsters` list (`monsters[n]`). The `distance` is the absolute value of the `position` of the last monster. The `time_available` is the same as `distance`. The `bullets_needed` is the health of the last monster. The `total_bullets_used` is the cumulative sum of the health of all monsters processed by the loop.
