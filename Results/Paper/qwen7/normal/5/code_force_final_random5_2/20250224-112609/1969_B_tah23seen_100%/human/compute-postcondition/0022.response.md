Output State: **`s` is a non-empty binary string starting from the second character, `i` is the next character in the original `s`, `cost` is increased by 1 plus the value of `one`, and `one` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `cost += one + 1` increments the value of `cost` by 1 plus the current value of `one`. The variables `s` and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The value of `one` remains unchanged because the code does not modify it directly.
