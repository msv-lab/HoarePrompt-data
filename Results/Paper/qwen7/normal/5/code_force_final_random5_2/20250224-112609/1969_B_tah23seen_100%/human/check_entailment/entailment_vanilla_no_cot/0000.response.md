Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The logic in `func_1` does not accurately reflect the minimum cost required for sorting the string through cyclic shifts.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to identify segments of '1's and '0's and calculate the cost based on the positions of these segments. Specifically, for each segment of '1's that needs to be moved to the front, the cost should be calculated as the length of the segment plus the distance it needs to be shifted.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    cost = 0
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        # Find the start of a segment of '1's
        start = i
        while i < n and s[i] == '1':
            i += 1
        # If there are no more '1's, break
        if i == n:
            break
        # Find the end of the current segment of '1's
        end = i
        while i < n and s[i] == '0':
            i += 1
        # Calculate the cost of shifting this segment to the front
        cost += end - start + 1
    return cost
```

This corrected function properly calculates the minimum cost by identifying segments of '1's and '0's and computing the necessary shifts.
