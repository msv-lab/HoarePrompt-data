Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. However, the logic implemented in the `func_1` function does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for performing cyclic shifts to sort the string.

The function `func_1` iterates through the string and increments the `cost` whenever it encounters a '0' followed by at least one '1'. It adds the count of '1's following that '0' plus one to the cost. This approach is flawed because it does not account for the optimal way to perform cyclic shifts to sort the string.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to identify the longest prefix of the string that is already sorted and then calculate the cost of cyclic shifts needed to move the remaining unsorted part to the beginning of the string. The cost of each cyclic shift is the length of the substring being shifted.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    i = 0
    while i < n and s[i] == '0':
        i += 1
    j = i
    while j < n and s[j] == '1':
        j += 1
    
    # If the entire string is already sorted
    if j == n:
        return 0
    
    # Calculate the cost of moving the unsorted part to the beginning
    cost = n - i
    return cost
```

With this corrected function, the program should work as expected. However, since the provided function does not implement the correct logic, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
