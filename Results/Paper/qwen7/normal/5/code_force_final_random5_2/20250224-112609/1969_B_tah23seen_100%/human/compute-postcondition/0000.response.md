Output State: **`s` is a binary string (a string consisting of only '0's and/or '1's) with a length between 2 and 200000; `cost` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `cost` to 0. Since the initial state of `s` is given as a binary string with a specific length range, and no operations are performed on `s`, its state remains unchanged. The `cost` variable is explicitly set to 0, so that is the updated state.
