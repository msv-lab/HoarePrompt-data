Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Function Call**: For each test case, the program calls `func_1(s)` and prints the result, then decrements `t` until all test cases are processed.
3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes `cost` to 0 and `one` to 0.
   - **Loop through String**: It iterates through each character in the string `s`.
     - If the character is '1', it increments the count of '1's (`one`).
     - If the character is '0' and there have been at least one '1' encountered (`one > 0`), it adds `one + 1` to the `cost`. This logic is intended to account for the cost of cyclic shifts needed to move '1's to the end of the string.
4. **Cost Calculation**: The logic for calculating the cost seems correct. By adding `one + 1` whenever a '0' is encountered after at least one '1', it effectively counts the number of shifts required to move all '1's to the end of the string.
5. **Edge Cases**: The provided examples cover various scenarios, including strings that are already sorted, strings with all '0's, and mixed strings. The function handles these cases correctly.

Given the analysis, the provided program appears to be correct based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
