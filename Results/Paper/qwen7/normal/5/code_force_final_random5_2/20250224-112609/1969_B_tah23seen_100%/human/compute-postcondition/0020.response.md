Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `s`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `s` is a non-empty binary string starting from the second character.
   - `i` is the second character of the original `s`.
   - `cost` is increased by 1 plus the value of `one` if the second character `i` is '0' and `one` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each character in `s`, the variable `i` will be the next character in the string `s`.
   - The variable `s` remains the same unless modified within the loop body (which is omitted here).
   - The variable `cost` may change based on the condition `i == '0' and one > 0`.

Given the information, let's assume the following:
- The second character `i` is processed, and now we need to consider the next character in `s`.
- If `i` was '0' and `one` was greater than 0, `cost` would have been incremented by 1 plus the value of `one`.

Since the loop continues to the next character in `s`, the new `i` will be the next character in the string `s`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `s` remains the same as it did at the end of the previous iteration.
- `i` becomes the next character in `s`.
- `cost` remains unchanged unless the next character `i` is '0' and `one` is greater than 0.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`s` is a non-empty binary string starting from the second character, `i` is the next character in the original `s`, and `cost` is increased by 1 plus the value of `one` if the next character `i` is '0' and `one` is greater than 0.**
