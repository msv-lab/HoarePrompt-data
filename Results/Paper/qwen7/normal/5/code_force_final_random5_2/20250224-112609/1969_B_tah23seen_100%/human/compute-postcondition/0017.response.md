Postcondition: `s` is a non-empty binary string starting from the second character, `i` is the second character of the original `s`, and `cost` is increased by 1 plus the value of `one` if the second character `i` is '0' and `one` is greater than 0. If the condition `i == '0' and one > 0` is not met, the values of `s`, `i`, and `cost` remain unchanged.
