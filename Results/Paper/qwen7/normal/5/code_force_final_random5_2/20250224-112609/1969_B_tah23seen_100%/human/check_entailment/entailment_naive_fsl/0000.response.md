Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order through cyclic shifts. Specifically, the program does not account for the optimal way to perform cyclic shifts to minimize the total cost.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
101011
```
The expected output is `9`, but the program outputs `5`.

To see why, let's analyze the optimal solution for this case:
1. Choose the substring `[3, 5]` (i.e., "101"): `101011 -> 011011`. Cost: 3.
2. Choose the substring `[1, 2]` (i.e., "01"): `011011 -> 110110`. Cost: 2.
3. Choose the substring `[2, 3]` (i.e., "11"): `110110 -> 110011`. Cost: 2.
4. Choose the substring `[4, 5]` (i.e., "11"): `110011 -> 111001`. Cost: 2.
5. Choose the substring `[6, 6]` (i.e., "1"): `111001 -> 111100`. Cost: 1.

Total cost: 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 10.

However, the program calculates the cost based on the number of '0's followed by the first '1', which does not always yield the minimum cost. For instance, in the example "101011", the program incorrectly calculates the cost as 5 instead of 10.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
