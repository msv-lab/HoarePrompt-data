The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t (number of test cases), an integer n (length of strings), and three strings a, b, and c (each of length n). For each test case, it checks if for every index i from 0 to n-1, either a[i] ≠ c[i] or b[i] ≠ c[i]. If this condition holds for all indices, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
