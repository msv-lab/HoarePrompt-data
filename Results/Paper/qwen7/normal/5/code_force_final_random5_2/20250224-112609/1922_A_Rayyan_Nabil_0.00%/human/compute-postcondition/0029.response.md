Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is currently `n + 1`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1 (since `range(n)` generates numbers from 0 to `n-1`).

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` is `n + 1`, it means `i` is initially set to a value that is one more than `n`. This is fine as long as `n` is at least 1.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0**
