Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `l` is 'YES'.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but based on the postcondition, if `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]` and `b[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, then `l` is set to 'YES'. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged, and `l` remains 'YES'.

4. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be 3.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i < n`.
   - Since `n` must be greater than 0, it can change, but it is not specified how or if it changes. Therefore, we assume `n` remains the same unless otherwise stated.

5. **Postcondition for the Next Iteration:**
   - `t` must still be greater than 0.
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0.
   - `l` remains 'YES' because the loop body did not change its value.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` will be 3.
- `n` must still be greater than 0.
- `t` must still be greater than 0.
- `l` remains 'YES'.

So, the updated state is:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, and `l` is 'YES'**.
