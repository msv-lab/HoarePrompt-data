Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is already given as `0`.
   - `n` is not explicitly given, but it is a crucial variable for determining whether the loop will execute.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1 (since `range(n)` generates numbers from 0 to `n-1`).

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - The value of `i` is already set to 0, so no adjustment is needed for `i`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string from the user, `c` is an input string, `n` must be greater than 0**
