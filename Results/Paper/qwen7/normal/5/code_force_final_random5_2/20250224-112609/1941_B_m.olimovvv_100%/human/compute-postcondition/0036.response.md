Output State: **`a` must be at least 3, `b[i]` is less than 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where `b[i]` is being checked and updated. The values of `a` and `b[i]` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
