Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` must be at least 3.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `b[i + 2]` is decreased by the value of the original `b[i]`.

The print statement is `print('NO')`.

Since the print statement directly outputs the string `'NO'` without referencing any variables or objects whose values need to be determined, the output is straightforward.

Output: **NO**
