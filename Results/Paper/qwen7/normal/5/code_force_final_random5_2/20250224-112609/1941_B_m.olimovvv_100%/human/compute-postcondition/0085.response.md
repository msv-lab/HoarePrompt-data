Postcondition: `b[i]` is `b[i + 1]`, `b[i + 1]` is unchanged, `b[i + 2]` is unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`, and `a` must be greater than `i + 2`. If `b[i]` is less than 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same regardless of the if condition.
