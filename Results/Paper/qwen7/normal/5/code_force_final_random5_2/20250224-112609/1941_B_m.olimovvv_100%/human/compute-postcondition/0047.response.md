Output State: **`a` must be at least 3; `i` is incremented by 1; `b[i + 1]` is decreased by twice the value of the original `b[i]`; `b[i + 2]` is decreased by the value of the original `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2` decreases the value of `b[i + 1]` by twice the value of `b[i]`. Additionally, the postcondition states that `i` is incremented by 1 and `b[i + 2]` is decreased by the value of the original `b[i]`. The conditions involving breaking out of loops or if statements remain unchanged.
