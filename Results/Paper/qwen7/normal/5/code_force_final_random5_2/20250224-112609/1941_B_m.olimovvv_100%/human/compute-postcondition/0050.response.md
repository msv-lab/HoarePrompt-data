Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` must be at least 3.
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `b[i + 1]` is decreased by twice the value of the original `b[i]`.
   - `b[i + 2]` is decreased by the value of the original `b[i]`.
   - `b[i]` is set to 0.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(0, a - 2):
   ```

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `a - 2`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - We need to determine the new values of `i` and `a` for the next iteration.
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i + 1` must still be less than `a - 2`.

5. **New State Calculation:**
   - The new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - To ensure the loop continues, `a` must remain the same (since it does not change within the loop).

6. **Final State:**
   - `a` must be at least 3 (unchanged).
   - `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The conditions for `b[i + 1]`, `b[i + 2]`, and `b[i]` will be adjusted accordingly for the new `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`a` must be at least 3, `i` is `i + 1`, `b[i + 1]` is decreased by twice the value of the original `b[i]`, `b[i + 2]` is decreased by the value of the original `b[i]`, `b[i]` is set to 0**.
