Output State: **`a` must be at least 3, `i` is `i + 1`, `b[i + 1]` is decreased by twice the value of the original `b[i]`, `b[i + 2]` is decreased by the value of the original `b[i]`, `b[i]` is set to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This output state reflects that the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The conditions and changes to the variables specified before the `break` statement remain intact.
