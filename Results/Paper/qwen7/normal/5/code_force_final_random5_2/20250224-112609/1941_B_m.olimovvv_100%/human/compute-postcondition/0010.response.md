Output State: **`a` is an input integer greater than 2, `b` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `i` is 0, `b[i + 1]` is decreased by twice the value of `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2` modifies the list `b` by subtracting twice the value of `b[i]` from `b[i + 1]`. Given the initial state where `i` is 0, this means `b[1]` (the second element in the list) is updated to be itself minus twice the value of `b[0]`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
