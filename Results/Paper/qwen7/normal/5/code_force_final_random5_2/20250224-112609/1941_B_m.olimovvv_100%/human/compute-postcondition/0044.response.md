Output State: **`a` must be at least 3; `i` is `i + 1`; `b[i + 2]` is decreased by the value of the original `b[i]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it does not change the values of `a`, `i`, or `b[i + 2]` directly, but it indicates that we are breaking out of the loop or conditional block where these assignments were made. Therefore, the conditions and values before the `break` statement remain unchanged.
