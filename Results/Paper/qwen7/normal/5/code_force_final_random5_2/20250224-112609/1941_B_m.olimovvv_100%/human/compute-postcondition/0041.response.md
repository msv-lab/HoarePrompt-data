Output State: **`a` must be at least 3; `b[i]` is 0; `b[i + 2]` is decreased by the value of the original `b[i]`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code `b[i] -= b[i]` subtracts the value of `b[i]` from itself, effectively setting `b[i]` to 0. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged. The state of `b[i + 2]` is decreased by the original value of `b[i]`, but since `b[i]` is now 0, there is no further change to `b[i + 2]`.
