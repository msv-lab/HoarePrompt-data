Output State: **`a` is an input integer decremented by 1**.

Explanation: The code `a = int(input())` takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable `a`. It does not provide any specific value for `a`, so we just know that `a` is now an integer that was originally greater than 3 but has been decremented by 1. The initial conditions of the list `b` and the printing logic remain unchanged.
