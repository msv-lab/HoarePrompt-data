Output State: **`a` must be at least 3; `i` is incremented by 1; `b[i + 1]` is decreased by twice the value of the original `b[i]`; `b[i + 2]` is decreased by the value of the original `b[i]; b[i]` is set to 0.**

Explanation: The code `b[i] -= b[i]` sets `b[i]` to 0 because subtracting `b[i]` from itself results in 0. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
