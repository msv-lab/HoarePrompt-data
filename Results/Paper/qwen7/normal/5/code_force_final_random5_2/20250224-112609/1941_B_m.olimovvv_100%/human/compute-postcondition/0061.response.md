Output State: **`a` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The initial value of `a` is 2. The code snippet updates `a` to the integer value of the user's input. Since the actual input value is not specified, `a` is now an integer that depends on the input provided by the user. All other information from the initial state remains unchanged.
