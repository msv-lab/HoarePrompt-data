Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array itself.
3. It then iterates through the array from index 0 to \(a-3\) (since it performs operations involving indices \(i+1\) and \(i+2\)).
4. In each iteration, it checks if the current element \(b[i]\) is negative. If it is, it immediately prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop, which is correct because if any element becomes negative, it's impossible to make all elements zero.
5. If no element becomes negative during the loop, it checks the last two elements after the loop. If either of them is non-zero, it prints 'NO', indicating that it's not possible to make all elements zero.
6. If all checks pass, it prints 'YES'.

Given the logic and the steps followed by the program, it aligns with the problem statement and correctly determines whether it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations.

Correctness: **True**
