Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, `n` is now `n` // 2, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s` + `x`, `m` is 2, `x` is (n + 1) // 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change any variable values but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block. Since no variables are reassigned or altered by the `break` statement, their previous states remain unchanged.
