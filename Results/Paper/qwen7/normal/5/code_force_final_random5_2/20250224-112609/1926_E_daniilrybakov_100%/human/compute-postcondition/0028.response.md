Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5⋅10^4, `n` is now `n` // 2, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s` + `x`, `m` is 4, `x` is (n + 1) // 2, `s` is increased by `x`, and `s` is equal to `s` + `x`**.

The code `s += x` increments the value of `s` by `x`. Given the initial conditions, `s` is already `s` + `x` before this operation, and after the operation, `s` is increased by `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.
