Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `n`.
2. **Determine the current state**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `s` is 0.
   - `m` is 1.

3. **Check the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `n` is non-zero (i.e., `n != 0`).

4. **Adjust the necessary states**: Since the loop condition depends solely on `n`, we need to ensure that `n` is non-zero for the loop to execute at least once.

Given that `n` is an input integer and its current state is not specified, we need to ensure that `n` is non-zero for the loop to proceed.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that `n` is non-zero.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, `n` must be non-zero, `k` is an input integer, `s` is 0, `m` is 1**
