Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\).
   - `n` becomes 1 (since it is continuously halved and will reach 1 when fully divided).
   - `k` is the input integer.
   - `s` is the sum of all `x` values calculated during each iteration.
   - `m` is \(2^3 = 8\) (as `m` is multiplied by 2 for each iteration, and the loop executes 3 times).
   - `x` is \((n + 1) // 2 = (1 + 1) // 2 = 1\).

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for _ in range(t):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting States:**
   - The loop variable `_` is an underscore, which is a common practice to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body.
   - Since the loop does not use the loop variable `_`, we do not need to adjust any specific variables based on the loop itself.
   - However, we need to consider how the loop affects the other variables.

4. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs `t` times.
   - Each iteration updates the value of `n` by halving it.
   - `m` is multiplied by 2 for each iteration.
   - `x` is calculated as \((n + 1) // 2\).
   - `s` is updated by adding the current value of `x` to it.

5. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - After the first iteration, `n` will be halved, `m` will be doubled, and `x` will be recalculated.
   - Since `n` starts at 1 and is halved each time, it will become 0.5 after the first iteration, but since `n` must remain an integer, it will stay at 1.
   - `m` will be \(8 \times 2 = 16\).
   - `x` will be \((1 + 1) // 2 = 1\).
   - `s` will be updated by adding the current value of `x` to it.

Given that the loop runs `t` times and `n` will always be 1 (since it starts at 1 and is halved but remains 1), `m` will be \(2^t\), and `x` will be 1 for each iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `t` remains the same.
- `n` remains 1.
- `m` is \(2^t\).
- `x` is 1.
- `s` is the cumulative sum of `x` values from each iteration.

Since the loop runs `t` times, after the first iteration, `t` remains the same, `n` is still 1, `m` is \(2^t\), `x` is 1, and `s` is updated by adding 1 to it.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 × 10^4, `n` is 1, `m` is \(2^t\), `x` is 1, `s` is \(s + 1\)**.
