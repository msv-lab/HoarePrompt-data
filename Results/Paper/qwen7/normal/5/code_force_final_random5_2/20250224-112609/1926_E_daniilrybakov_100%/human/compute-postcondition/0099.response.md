Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\), `n` is now `n // 2` raised to the power of the total number of iterations the loop executed, `k` is an input integer, `m` is \(2\) raised to the power of the total number of iterations the loop executed, `x` is \((n + 1) // 2\) for the final iteration, and `s` is the sum of `x` values from each iteration.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` remains within the range of 1 to 50,000, `n` is reduced to `n` // \(2^t\)` (where \(t\) is the total number of iterations), `k` remains as the input integer, `m` is \(2^t\) (as `m` doubles every iteration), `x` is calculated as \((n + 1) // 2\) for the last iteration, and `s` is the cumulative sum of `x` values from each iteration.
