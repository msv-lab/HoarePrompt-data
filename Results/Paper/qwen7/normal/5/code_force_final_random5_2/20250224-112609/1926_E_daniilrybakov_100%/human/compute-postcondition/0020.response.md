Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5⋅10^4, `n` is now `n` // 2, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s` + `x`, `m` is 2, `x` is (n + 1) // 2, and `s` is increased by `x`.**

Explanation: The code `s += x` increases the value of `s` by the current value of `x`. The value of `x` is defined as `(n + 1) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
