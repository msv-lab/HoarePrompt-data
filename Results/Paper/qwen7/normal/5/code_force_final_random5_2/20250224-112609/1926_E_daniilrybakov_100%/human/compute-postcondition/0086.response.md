Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\), `n` is `n // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `m` is 4, `x` is \((n + 1) // 2\), `s` is \((n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 2 + (n + 1) // 2\)**.

Explanation: The code `m *= 2` multiplies the value of `m` by 2. Initially, `m` was 2, so now `m` becomes 4. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
