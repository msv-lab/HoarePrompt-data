The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers t, n, and k. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the given n and k, where n is repeatedly halved and k is compared against a cumulative sum. The final output is derived from the difference between k and the cumulative sum, scaled by a factor related to the number of halving operations performed.
