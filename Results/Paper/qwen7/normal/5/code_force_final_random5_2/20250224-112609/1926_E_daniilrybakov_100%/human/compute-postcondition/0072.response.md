Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\), `n` is the integer value of `n` divided by 2 (using floor division), `k` is an input integer, `m` is 1, `x` is \((n + 1) // 2\), `s` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `n //= 2` divides `n` by 2 using floor division, which means the result is rounded down to the nearest whole number. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
