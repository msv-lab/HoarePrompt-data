Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 × 10^4, `n` is `n // 2`, `k` is the input integer, `s` is increased by `x`, `m` is 4, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`, and `s` is increased by `x`.**

Explanation: The code `s += x` increases the value of `s` by `x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial conditions. Therefore, the updated state includes the increase in `s` by `x`.
