Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\), `n` is `n // 2`, `k` is an input integer, `m` is 2, `x` is \((n + 1) // 2\), and `s` is \((n + 1) // 2\), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change any variable values but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. All other variables retain their initial states.
