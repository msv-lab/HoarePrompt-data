Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, and `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = 0
    m = 1
    while n:
        x = (n + 1) // 2
        n //= 2
        if s < k and k <= s + x:
            break
        s += x
        m *= 2
    print((2 * (k - s) - 1) * m)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5⋅10^4, `n` is now `n` // 2 raised to the power of the number of iterations (which is 3 in this case), `k` is an input integer, `s` is the sum of all `x` values calculated during each iteration, `m` is 8 (since it doubles every iteration and we iterate 3 times), `x` is (n + 1) // 2 for the final iteration, and `s` is increased by `x`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` remains within the range of 1 to 50,000, `n` is reduced to `n` // 2 three times (i.e., `n` // 8), `k` remains as the input integer, `s` is the cumulative sum of `x` values from each iteration, `m` is 8 (as it doubles every iteration), `x` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2` for the last iteration, and `s` is incremented by this final `x` value.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 × 10^4, `n` becomes 1 (since it is continuously halved and will reach 1 when fully divided), `k` is the input integer, `s` is the sum of all `x` values calculated during each iteration, `m` is \(2^3 = 8\) (as `m` is multiplied by 2 for each iteration, and the loop executes 3 times), and `x` is \((n + 1) // 2 = (1 + 1) // 2 = 1\).

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `n` will be 1, `m` will be 8, and `s` will be the cumulative sum of `x` values from each iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\), `n` is now `n // 2` raised to the power of the number of iterations the loop executed, `k` is an input integer, `m` is \(2\) raised to the power of the number of iterations the loop executed, `x` is \((n + 1) // 2\), and `s` is the sum of `x` added for each iteration the loop executed.

To explain further, let's denote the number of iterations as `i`. After `i` iterations, the value of `n` will be the original `n` divided by \(2^i\). The variable `m` will be \(2^i\) because it gets multiplied by 2 in each iteration. The value of `x` will be \((n + 1) // 2\) after the last iteration. The variable `s` will be the sum of `x` for each iteration, which is essentially the sum of terms where each term is \((n // 2^j + 1) // 2\) for \(j\) from 0 to \(i-1\).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
