Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 × 10^4, `n` is halved from its current value, `k` is the input integer, `s` is increased by `x`, `m` is 1, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code `s += x` increments the value of `s` by `x`. The value of `x` is defined as `(n + 1) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
