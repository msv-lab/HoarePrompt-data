Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\), `n` must be at least 1, `k` is an input integer, `m` is 2, `x` is \((n + 1) // 2\), and `s` is \((n + 1) // 2\)**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `(n + 1) // 2` to the variable `x`. Since `x` was already defined as \((n + 1) // 2\) before the code execution, the value of `x` remains unchanged. The value of `s` is also updated to be equal to `x`, which is \((n + 1) // 2\). All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, and `m`) remain in their initial states.
