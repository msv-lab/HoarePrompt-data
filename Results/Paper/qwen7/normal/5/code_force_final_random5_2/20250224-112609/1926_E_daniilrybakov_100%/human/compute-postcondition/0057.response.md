Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 × 10^4, `n` is now `n // 2`, `k` is the input integer, `s` is increased by `x`, `m` is 4, `x` is `(n + 1) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code `n //= 2` divides `n` by 2 and assigns the result back to `n`. The other variables (`t`, `k`, `s`, `m`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
