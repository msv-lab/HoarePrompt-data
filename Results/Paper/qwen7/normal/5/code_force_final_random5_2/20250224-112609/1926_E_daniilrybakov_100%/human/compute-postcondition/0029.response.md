Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5⋅10^4, `n` is now `n` // 2, `k` is an input integer, `s` is `s` + `x`, `m` is 8, `x` is (n + 1) // 2, `s` is increased by `x`.**

Explanation: 
- The value of `m` is multiplied by 2, so `m` changes from 4 to 8.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, `x`, and the operation `s` is increased by `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
