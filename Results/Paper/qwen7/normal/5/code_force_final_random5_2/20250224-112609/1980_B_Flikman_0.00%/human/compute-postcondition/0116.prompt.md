Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `same_value_count` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `f` is the integer value of the second input, `k` is the integer value of the third input, `greater_count` is the total count of elements in list `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`, `k` is the threshold value, and `t` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of integers created from the input split by spaces, `favorite_value` is the element at index `f - 1` in list `a`.
Code of the loop:
for value in a:
    if value == favorite_value:
        same_value_count += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `same_value_count` is 1, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `f` is the integer value of the second input, `k` is the integer value of the third input, `greater_count` is the total count of elements in list `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`, `k` is the threshold value, `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `favorite_value` is the element at index `f - 1` in list `a`, and if the current value of `value` is equal to `favorite_value`, `same_value_count` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `same_value_count` is either 1 or 2, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `f` is the integer value of the second input, `k` is the integer value of the third input, `greater_count` is the total count of elements in list `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`, `k` is the threshold value, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `favorite_value` is the element at index `f - 1` in list `a`, and `value` is the next element in list `a`. If `value` equals `favorite_value`, `same_value_count` becomes 2; otherwise, it remains 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `same_value_count` is either 2 or 3. If `value` equals `favorite_value`, then `same_value_count` becomes 2 or 3 depending on its initial value. If `value` does not equal `favorite_value`, `same_value_count` remains unchanged and stays at 1 or 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
