Postcondition: **`same_value_count` is 0, `greater_count` is equal to the total number of elements in list `a` that are greater than `a[f - 1]`, `n` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `favorite_value` is now the element `a[f - 1]`, the current value of `value` is equal to `favorite_value`**
