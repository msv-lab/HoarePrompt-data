Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Dmitry's favorite cube will be removed based on the given conditions. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the program works:

1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of cubes `n`, the index of the favorite cube `f`, and the number of removed cubes `k`.
3. It then reads the values of the cubes `a`.
4. It finds the value of the favorite cube.
5. It counts how many cubes have the same value as the favorite cube.
6. It counts how many cubes have a value greater than the favorite cube.
7. Based on these counts, it determines whether the favorite cube will definitely be removed (`YES`), definitely not be removed (`NO`), or might be removed depending on the counts (`MAYBE`).

The logic is sound and matches the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
