Postcondition: `same_value_count` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `f` is the integer value of the second input, `k` is the integer value of the third input, `greater_count` is the total count of elements in list `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`, `k` is the threshold value, `t` must be greater than 0, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `favorite_value` is the element at index `f - 1` in list `a`, and the current value of `value` is equal to `favorite_value`.
