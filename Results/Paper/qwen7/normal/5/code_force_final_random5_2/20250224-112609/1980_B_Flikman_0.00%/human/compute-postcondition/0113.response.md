Output State: **`same_value_count` is either 2 or 3 depending on whether `value` equals `favorite_value`.**

Explanation: The variable `same_value_count` is incremented by 1. Since its initial value was either 1 or 2, after executing `same_value_count += 1`, its new value will be either 2 or 3. The value of `value` and `favorite_value` remains unchanged, and no other variables are affected.
