Postcondition: `same_value_count` is either 1 or 2, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `f` is the integer value of the second input, `k` is the integer value of the third input, `greater_count` is the total count of elements in list `a` that are greater than `favorite_value`, `k` is the threshold value, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `favorite_value` is the element at index `f - 1` in list `a`, and `value` is the next element in list `a`. If `value` equals `favorite_value`, `same_value_count` is incremented to 2; otherwise, `same_value_count` remains 1.
