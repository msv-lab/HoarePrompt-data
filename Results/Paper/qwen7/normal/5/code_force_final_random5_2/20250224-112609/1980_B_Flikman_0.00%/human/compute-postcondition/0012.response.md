Output State: **`value` is the next element in the list `a`, `same_value_count` is `same_value_count` + 1**

The code increments `same_value_count` by 1. Since `same_value_count` was equal to its previous value in the previous iteration, now it is one more than that previous value. The value of `value` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
