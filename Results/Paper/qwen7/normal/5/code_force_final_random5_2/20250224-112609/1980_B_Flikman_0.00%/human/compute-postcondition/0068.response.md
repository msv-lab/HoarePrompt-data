Postcondition: `same_value_count` is either 2 or 4, `value` is the next element in the list `a`, `greater_count` is equal to the total number of elements in list `a` that are greater than `a[f - 1]`, `n` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `favorite_value` is now the element `a[f - 1]`. If `value` equals `favorite_value`, then `same_value_count` becomes either 2 or 4. If `value` does not equal `favorite_value`, then no change occurs to `same_value_count`.
