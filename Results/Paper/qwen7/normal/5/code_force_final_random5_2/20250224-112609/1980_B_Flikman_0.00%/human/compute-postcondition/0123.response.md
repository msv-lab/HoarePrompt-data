Postcondition: `greater_count` is either 0 or 1, `same_value_count` is between 0 and the length of list `a`, inclusive, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `f` is the integer value of the second input, `k` is the integer value of the third input, `favorite_value` is the element at index `f - 1` in list `a`, and if the first element of list `a` is greater than `favorite_value`, `greater_count` is set to 1; otherwise, `greater_count` remains 0.
