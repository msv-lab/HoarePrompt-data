Postcondition: **`greater_count` will be equal to the total number of elements in list `a` that are greater than the `favorite_value`, `same_value_count` will be between 0 and the length of list `a`, inclusive, `n` will be the integer value of the first input, `f` will be the integer value of the second input, `k` will be the integer value of the third input, and `favorite_value` will be the element at index `f - 1` in list `a`. If `greater_count + same_value_count` is less than or equal to `k`, then `greater_count` is unchanged. Otherwise, `greater_count` is updated to the total number of elements in list `a` that are greater than the `favorite_value`.**
