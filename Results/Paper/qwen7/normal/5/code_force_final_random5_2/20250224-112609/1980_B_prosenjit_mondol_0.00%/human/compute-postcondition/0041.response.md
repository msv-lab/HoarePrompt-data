Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `f` is the second integer input minus 2, so \(f = \text{second\_input} - 2\).
- `k` is the third integer input minus 2, so \(k = \text{third\_input} - 2\).
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and sorted in descending order.
- `x` is the element at index `f` in list `a`.

The print statement is `print('NO')`.

Given this, the output of the print statement is simply the string `'NO'`.

Output: **'NO'**
