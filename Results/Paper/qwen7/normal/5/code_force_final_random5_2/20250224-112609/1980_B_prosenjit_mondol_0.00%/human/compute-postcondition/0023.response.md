Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n`, `f`, `k` are integers obtained from the input split, `k` is decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `x` is the element at index `f` in list `a`, `a` is sorted in descending order, and `n`, `f`, `k`, `a`, and `x` are updated according to the input.**

The code `n, f, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `f`, and `k`. It does not affect the value of `t` or the list `a`. The value of `k` is decreased by 1. The values of `n`, `f`, `k`, `a`, and `x` are now dependent on the input provided.
