Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split, `k` is decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `x` is the element at index `f` in list `a`, list `a` is sorted in descending order, and if `a[k]` is greater than `x`, `a[k]` remains unchanged; otherwise, `a[k]` is greater than `x`.
