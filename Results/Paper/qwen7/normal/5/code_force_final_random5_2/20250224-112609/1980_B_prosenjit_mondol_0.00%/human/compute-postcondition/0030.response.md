Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 1000`.
- `n`, `f`, `k` are integers obtained from the input split.
- `k` is now `k - 1`.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and is sorted in descending order.
- `f` is decreased by 1.
- `x` is the element at index `f` in list `a`.

The print statement is simply:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the other variables.

Output: **YES**
