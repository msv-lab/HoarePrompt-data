Output State: **a is (x, y), dx is the first element of b, dy is the second element of b**

Explanation: The code `dx, dy = b` unpacks the tuple `b` into two variables `dx` and `dy`. Since the initial state does not specify the content of `b`, we assume `b` is a tuple with two elements. After executing the code, `dx` will be assigned the first element of `b`, and `dy` will be assigned the second element of `b`. The tuple `a` remains unchanged, and its value is still `(x, y)`.
