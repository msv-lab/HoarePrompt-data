Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, a and b, where a is a tuple containing two integers (x, y) representing coordinates, and b is a tuple containing two integers (dx, dy) representing the change in coordinates. The function returns a new tuple containing the updated coordinates (x + dx, y + dy).**
