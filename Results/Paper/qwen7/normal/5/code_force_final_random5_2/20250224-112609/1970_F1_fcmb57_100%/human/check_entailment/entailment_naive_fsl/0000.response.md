Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where a player throws the Quaffle into their own goal. According to the problem description, if a player throws the Quaffle into their own goal, the other team wins a point. However, the current implementation only checks if the player has thrown the Quaffle into the opponent's goal and does not account for the player throwing it into their own goal.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3 5
.. .. R0 .. ..
RG .. .Q .. BG
.. .. B0 .. ..
12
R0 D
R0 C .Q
R0 R
R0 T
R0 D
B0 R
B0 U
B0 C .Q
B0 L
B0 L
B0 L
B0 T
```

In this case, the red player takes the Quaffle, moves it, and throws it into the red goal, which should result in the blue team scoring a point. However, the program does not detect this and does not update the score accordingly. Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the rule for scoring points when a player throws the Quaffle into their own goal.
