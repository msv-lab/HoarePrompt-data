#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers representing the dimensions N and M of the field respectively, where 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and N and M are odd. The field is represented as a 2D list of strings, where each string contains M characters and there are N such strings. The list contains characters representing empty cells ('..'), players ('R0' to 'R9', 'B0' to 'B9'), goals ('RG', 'BG'), and the Quaffle ('.Q'). Additionally, the function takes a list of actions, where each action is a string describing the entity performing the action and the action itself (e.g., 'B2 U' for player B2 moving up).
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns a tuple containing x + dx and y + dy, where x and y are the elements of the tuple a, and dx and dy are the first and second elements of the tuple b respectively.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two tuples, `a` and `b`, where `a` contains the current coordinates (x, y) and `b` contains the changes in coordinates (dx, dy). It calculates and returns a new tuple containing the updated coordinates (x + dx, y + dy).
