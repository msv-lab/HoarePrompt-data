Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`, and either `idx1` or `idx2` is set to `n-3`; `p2` is 1; both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative; the list `val` is created but is empty; `idx2` is `n-3`; `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`; `m` equals 2.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified within the statement itself, all the conditions and values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
