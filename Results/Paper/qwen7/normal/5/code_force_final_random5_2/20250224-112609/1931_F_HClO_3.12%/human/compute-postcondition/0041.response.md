Output State: **`idx1` is `n - 1 - max(p1, p2)`, `idx2` is -1, `a1` is 0, `a2` is 0, `l11` is 0, `l22` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is 0, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `i` is equal to `n - 1 - max(p1, p2)`, and `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` to `idx1`. Given that `i` is defined as `n - 1 - max(p1, p2)`, `idx1` will now hold this value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
