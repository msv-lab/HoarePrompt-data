Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`, and either `idx1` or `idx2` is set to `n-3`; `p2` is 1; both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative; the list `val` is created but is empty; `idx1` is less than `idx2`; the list `val` remains empty, `a2` is inserted at index `idx1`.**

In this output state, the list `val` remains unchanged as it was initially empty. The variable `a2` is inserted into the list at the index `idx1`. All other conditions and values remain as they were in the initial state.
