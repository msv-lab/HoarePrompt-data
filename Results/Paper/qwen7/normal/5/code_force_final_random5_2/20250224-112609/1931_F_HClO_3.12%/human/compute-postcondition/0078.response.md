Output State: **`idx1` and `idx2` are either -1 or specific values based on the conditions, `a1` and `a2` remain 0, `l11` and `l22` remain 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is 0, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `idx2` is `i`.**

Explanation: The code `p2 = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `p2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
