Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`, and `idx1` is set to `i` or `idx2` is set to `i`; `p2` is 1; `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative; `idx2` is now 2.**

Explanation: The code snippet `p2 = 1` simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `p2`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `p1`, `idx1`, `idx2`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition involving the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` not equaling `n - 1` remains the same as well.
