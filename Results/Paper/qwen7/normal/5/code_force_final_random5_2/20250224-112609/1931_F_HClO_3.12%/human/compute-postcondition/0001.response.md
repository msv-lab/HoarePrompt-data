State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `t` which is used as the argument for the `range()` function.
2. For the loop to execute, `range(t)` must generate at least one iteration.
3. `range(t)` generates `t` iterations if `t` is a positive integer.
4. Therefore, `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Since no other variables or states are involved in the loop head, only `t` needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute.
