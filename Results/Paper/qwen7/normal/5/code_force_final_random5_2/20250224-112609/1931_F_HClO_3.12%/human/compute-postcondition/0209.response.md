Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`, and either `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1` with `p1` being 1, or `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1` with `p1` being 1, or `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`, `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`, and `p2` is 1, and both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, and `idx1` and `idx2` are both set to `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no explicit loop or conditional block mentioned, the `break` statement simply exits the context where it is placed. The values of the variables `i`, `n`, `p1`, `p2`, `l1`, `l2`, `a1`, `a2`, `idx1`, and `idx2` remain unchanged, and the condition specified in the initial state still holds true. We also note that the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
