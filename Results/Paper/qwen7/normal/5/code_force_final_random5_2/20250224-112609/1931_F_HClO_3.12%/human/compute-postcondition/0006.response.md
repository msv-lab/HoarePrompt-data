Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer and equals 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by this statement, the values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.
