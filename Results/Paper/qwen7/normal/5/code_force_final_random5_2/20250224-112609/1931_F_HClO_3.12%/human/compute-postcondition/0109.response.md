Output State: **`a3` is an integer from the input split into a list, `l3` is a list of integers from the remaining input split, `idx1` is less than or equal to `idx2`, `a1` is 0, `a2` is 0, `l11` is 0, `l22` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is 2, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is -1, `val` is an empty list, `l` is `l1`.**

Explanation: The line `l = l1` assigns the value of `l1` to the variable `l`. No other variables are affected, so their values remain unchanged. The additional element at index `idx2` in `l3` is `a1` (which is 0), but this does not affect the value of `l` since the assignment only changes the reference of `l` to `l1`.
