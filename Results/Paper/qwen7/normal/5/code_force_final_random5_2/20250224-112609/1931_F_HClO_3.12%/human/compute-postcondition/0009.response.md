Output State: **`a1` is the first integer input, `l1` is a list of remaining integers input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `a1, *l1 = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of space-separated integers as input and splits them into two parts. The first part is assigned to `a1` (which is the first integer), and the rest are assigned to `l1` as a list. The variables `n` and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state, as they are not affected by this line of code.
