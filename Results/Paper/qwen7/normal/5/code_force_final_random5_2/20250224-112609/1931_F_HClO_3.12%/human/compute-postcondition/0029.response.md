Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(n - 1)`.
   
2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The variable `i` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts (as is the case with the `range` function).

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `n - 1` for the loop to continue executing.

4. **Determine the value of `n`**: Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop continues until `i < n - 1`, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute even once. If `n` is 1 or less, the loop will not execute at all.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to start and execute at least once.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `a1` is 0, `a2` is 0, `l11` is 0, `l22` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is 0, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `i` is 0**
