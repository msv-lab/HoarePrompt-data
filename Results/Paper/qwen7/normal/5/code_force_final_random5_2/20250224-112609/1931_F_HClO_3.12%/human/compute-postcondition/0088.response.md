Output State: **`idx1` and `idx2` are either -1 or specific values based on the conditions, `a1` and `a2` remain 0, `l11` and `l22` remain 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is 0, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `i` is -1, `val` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `val = []` initializes an empty list named `val`. This does not affect the values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `a1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, `n`, `m`, `p1`, `p2`, or `i`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
