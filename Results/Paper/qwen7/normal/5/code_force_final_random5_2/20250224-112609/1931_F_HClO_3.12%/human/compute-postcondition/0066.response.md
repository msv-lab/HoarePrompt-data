Postcondition: **`idx1` and `idx2` are either -1 or specific values based on the conditions. `a1` and `a2` remain 0, `l11` and `l22` remain 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is 0, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is `n - 1`. If `l1[i + p1] == a2`, then `idx1` is `i`. Otherwise, `idx2` is `i`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
