Output State: **`idx1` is `n - 2`, `idx2` remains unchanged, `a1` and `a2` remain 0, `l11` and `l22` remain 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is 0, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `i` is `n - 2`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` (which is `n - 2`) to `idx1`. No other variables are affected. The conditions and values of `idx2`, `a1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, `n`, `m`, `p1`, `p2`, and `i` remain as they were in the initial state.
