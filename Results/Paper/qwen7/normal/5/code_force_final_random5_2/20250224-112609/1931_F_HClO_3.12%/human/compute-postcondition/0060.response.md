Output State: **`idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is either -1 or specific values based on the conditions, `a1` and `a2` remain 0, `l11` and `l22` remain 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is 0, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `i` is `n - 1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` to `idx1`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
