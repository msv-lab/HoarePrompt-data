Output State: `idx1` and `idx2` are either -1 or specific values based on the conditions, `a1` and `a2` remain 0, `l11` and `l22` remain 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is 0, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `i` is -1 (since the loop has completed all its iterations), and if `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` or `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be -1 because the loop has finished executing. The values of `idx1` and `idx2` will either remain -1 or will have been set to specific values based on the conditions within the loop. The values of `a1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, `n`, `m`, `p1`, and `p2` will remain as they were after the last iteration of the loop, which means they will either be 0 or have been incremented to 1 if the conditions inside the loop were met.
