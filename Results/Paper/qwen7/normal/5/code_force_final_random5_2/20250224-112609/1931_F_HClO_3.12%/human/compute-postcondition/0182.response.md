Output State: **`i` is 0, `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`, and `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`, `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` to both `idx1` and `idx2`. Since `i` is initially 0, `idx1` and `idx2` are also set to 0. All other conditions and values remain unchanged from the initial state.
