Output State: **`m` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `i` is -1, `val` is a list containing one tuple `(a3, l3),` and `l` is either `l1` or `l2` depending on the condition of the if statement.**

Explanation: The code `m -= 1` decrements the value of `m` by 1. Since `m` was initially 2, after executing this line, `m` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
