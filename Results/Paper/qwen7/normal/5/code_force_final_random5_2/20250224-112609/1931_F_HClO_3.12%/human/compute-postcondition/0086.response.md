Output State: `idx1` and `idx2` are either -1 or specific values based on the conditions, `a1` and `a2` remain 0, `l11` and `l22` remain 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `m` is 0, `p1` and `p2` are either 0 or 1, `i` is `n - 2`, and if `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` or `idx1` and `idx2` are both non-negative, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the values of `idx1` and `idx2` will either remain as -1 (indicating no match was found), or they will be set to specific indices where a mismatch between `l1` and `l2` occurred under certain conditions. The variables `a1`, `a2`, `l11`, `l22`, `n`, `m`, `p1`, `p2`, and `i` will retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop. Specifically, `i` will be `n - 2`, and the loop will break if either `i + max(p1, p2)` equals `n - 1` or both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative.
