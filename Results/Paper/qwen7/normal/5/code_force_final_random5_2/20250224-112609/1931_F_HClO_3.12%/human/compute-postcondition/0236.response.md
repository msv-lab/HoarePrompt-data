Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`, and either `idx1` or `idx2` is set to `i`; `p2` is 1; both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative; if the if condition is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and if the if condition is false, `idx2` remains 2.
