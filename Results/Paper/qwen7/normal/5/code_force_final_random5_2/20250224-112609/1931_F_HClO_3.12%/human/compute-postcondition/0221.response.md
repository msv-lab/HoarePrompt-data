Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(n - 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is greater than 1
   - The sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`
   - Either `idx1` is set to `i` or `idx2` is set to `i`
   - `p2` is 1
   - Both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative

4. **Determine the new value of `i`**: Since `i` starts from 1 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `2`.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n - 1`. Given that `i` is now 2 and `n` is greater than 1, the condition `i < n - 1` will still hold true if `n` is greater than 3.

6. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to update the state such that `i` is 2 and `n` remains greater than 1. The other conditions involving `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, and `idx2` remain unchanged because they are not directly affected by the loop incrementing `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`, and either `idx1` is set to `i` or `idx2` is set to `i`, `p2` is 1, and both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative**.
