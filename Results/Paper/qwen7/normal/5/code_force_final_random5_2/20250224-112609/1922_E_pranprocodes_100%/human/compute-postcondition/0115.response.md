Postcondition: `t` is 1, `i` is 3, `x` must not be equal to 1, `max` is within the range of -100000000 to 99999999, `min` is within the range of -100000000 to 99999999 and may be increased by 1, `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000 depending on whether `x` is even or odd, and `x` must not be equal to 1; if `x` is 0, `max` is decreased by 1; if `x` is 2, `min` is increased by 1 and `ans` includes the value of `min`.
