Postcondition: `t` is 2, `i` is 3, `x` is either 0 or 2, `max` and `min` are within the range of -100000000 to 99999999 and may be increased by 1, `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000 depending on whether `x` is even or odd, and if `x` is 0, `ans` contains `max - 1`; if `x` is 2, `ans` contains `min + 1`.
