Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` is an input integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is a list containing integers from 100000000 to -100000000 in reverse order, `t` is the total number of iterations until `x` becomes 1**.

Explanation: The line `min = -100000000` updates the value of the variable `min` to -100000000. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
