The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. The loop continues as long as `x` is not equal to 1. At the end of the last iteration, `x` must be different from 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be adjusted to be equal to 1.

State: **`i` is 1, `x` must be equal to 1, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000 depending on whether `x` is even or odd**
