Output State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 3, `x` must not be equal to 1, `max` is within the range of -100000000 to 99999999, `min` is within the range of -100000000 to 99999999, `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000 depending on whether `x` is even or odd.**

Explanation: The variable `t` was initially set to 0. After executing `t += 1`, the value of `t` is incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables (`i`, `x`, `max`, `min`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
