Output State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 3, `x` must not be equal to 1, `max` is within the range of -100000000 to 99999999, `min` is within the range of -100000000 to 99999999 and is increased by 1, `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000 depending on whether `x` is even or odd, and `x` must not be equal to 1; `ans` now includes the value of `min`.**

Explanation: The variable `min` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `min` was within the range of -100000000 to 99999999, and after incrementing, it remains within the same range but is now one unit larger than its original value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
