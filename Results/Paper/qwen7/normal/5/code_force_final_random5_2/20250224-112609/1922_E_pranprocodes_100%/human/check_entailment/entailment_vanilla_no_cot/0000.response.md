Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program attempts to construct an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences by appending either the maximum or minimum possible values to the array. However, this approach does not guarantee that the constructed array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. 

Hereâ€™s why the solution is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Constructing the Array**: The program tries to reduce `x` to 1 by repeatedly dividing it by 2 when even and decrementing it when odd. This logic does not ensure that the resulting array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
   
2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle all edge cases properly. For instance, when `X` is a prime number greater than 2, the program fails to produce a valid array because it cannot reduce `X` to 1 using the given operations.

3. **Output Format**: The program prints the length of the array and the array itself but does not check if the constructed array indeed has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. It simply assumes that the constructed array meets the requirement, which is not always true.

### Example Counter-Example:
Consider the input `X = 3`. The expected output could be `[0, 1, 0]`, which has exactly 3 increasing subsequences (`[0]`, `[1]`, `[0, 1]`). However, the provided program might not generate such an array correctly.

To solve this problem correctly, one would need to use combinatorial methods or dynamic programming to ensure that the constructed array has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
