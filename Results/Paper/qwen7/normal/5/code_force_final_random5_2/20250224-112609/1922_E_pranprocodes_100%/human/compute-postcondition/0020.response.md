Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` must be equal to 1, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is a list containing 99999999**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `max` to the list `ans`. Since `max` is 99999999, `ans` becomes a list containing 99999999. All other variables remain unchanged.
