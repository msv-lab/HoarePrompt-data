Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` is an input integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is 100000000, `ans` is a list containing integers from 100000000 to -100000000 in reverse order, `t` is the total number of iterations until `x` becomes 1**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `max` to 100000000, which was its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
