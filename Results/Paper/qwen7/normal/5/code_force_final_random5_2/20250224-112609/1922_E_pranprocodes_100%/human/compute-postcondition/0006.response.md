Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `while x != 1:`. The only variable involved here is `x`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `x` is not equal to 1.

3. **Current state of the variables**:
   - `i` is 0 (not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `x` is an input integer equal to `t`, and since `t` is 0, `x` is 0.
   - `max` is 100000000 (not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `min` is -100000000 (not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `ans` is an empty list (not relevant to the loop condition).

4. **Adjust the state of `x`**: For the loop to execute the first time, `x` must not be equal to 1. Currently, `x` is 0, which means the loop will not execute because `0 != 1` is true. To make the loop execute the first time, `x` must be set to any value other than 1.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `x`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `x` must be different from 1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty list**
