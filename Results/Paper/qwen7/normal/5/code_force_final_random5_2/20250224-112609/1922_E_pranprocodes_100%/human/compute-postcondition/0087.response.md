Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 2
- `x` is 1
- `max` is -100000000
- `min` is 100000000
- `ans` is a list containing integers from 100000000 to -100000000 in reverse order
- `t` is the total number of iterations until `x` becomes 1

The `print(*ans)` statement will print the contents of the list `ans`. Since `ans` contains integers from 100000000 to -100000000 in reverse order, the list looks like this:

\[ [100000000, 99999999, 99999998, \ldots, 1, 0, -1, -2, \ldots, -99999999, -100000000] \]

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the entire list `ans`.

Output: **100000000 99999999 99999998 ... 1 0 -1 -2 ... -99999999 -100000000**
