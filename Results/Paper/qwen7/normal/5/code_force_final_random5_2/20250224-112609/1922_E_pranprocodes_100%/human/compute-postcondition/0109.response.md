Output State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 3, `x` must not be equal to 1, `max` is within the range of -100000000 to 99999999, `min` is within the range of -100000000 to 99999999, `ans` is a list containing `max`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `max` to the list `ans`. Since `max` is within the range of -100000000 to 99999999, the updated `ans` list now contains this value. All other variables remain unchanged.
