Output State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 3, `x` is 2, `max` is within the range of -100000000 to 99999999, `min` is within the range of -100000000 to 99999999 and is increased by 1, `ans` is a list containing either 100000000 or -100000000 depending on whether `x` is even or odd, and `x` must not be equal to 1; `ans` now includes the value of `min`.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is decremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
