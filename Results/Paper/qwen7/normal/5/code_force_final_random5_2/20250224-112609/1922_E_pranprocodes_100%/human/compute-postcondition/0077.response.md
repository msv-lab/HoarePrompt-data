Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer greater than 1, `max` is 99999997, `min` is -99990000, `ans` is a list containing -99990000, and `t` is 2.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `min` to the list `ans`. Given that `min` is -99990000, the list `ans` now contains -99990000. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
