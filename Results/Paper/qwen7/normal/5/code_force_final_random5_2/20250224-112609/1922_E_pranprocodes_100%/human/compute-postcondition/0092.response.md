Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` is an input integer, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty list, `t` is the total number of iterations until `x` becomes 1.**

The code initializes `ans` as an empty list, which replaces its previous content (integers from 100000000 to -100000000 in reverse order). All other variables (`i`, `x`, `max`, `min`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
