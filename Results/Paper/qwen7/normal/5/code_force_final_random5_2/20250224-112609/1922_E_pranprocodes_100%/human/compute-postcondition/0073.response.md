The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is not equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is an input integer greater than 1. For the loop to be executed one more time, `x` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer greater than 1, `max` is 99999997, `min` is -99990000, `ans` is a list containing either 99999999 or -100000000, and `t` is 2, and `x` must be greater than 1**
