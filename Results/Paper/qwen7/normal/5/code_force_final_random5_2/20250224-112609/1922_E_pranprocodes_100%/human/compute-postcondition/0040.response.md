Output State: `i` is 1, `x` is 1, `max` is 99999899, `min` is -99999998, `ans` is a list containing [99999899, 99999999, -99999998], `t` is 2.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `x` will eventually become 1 because the loop continues to halve `x` when it is even and decrement it by 1 when it is odd until it reaches 1. The variable `i` remains unchanged at 1. The `max` value decreases by 1 each time it appends to `ans`, starting from 100000000 and ending at 99999899 after 100000000 - 2 iterations. Similarly, `min` increases by 1 each time it appends to `ans`, starting from -100000000 and ending at -99999998 after 100000000 - 2 iterations. The list `ans` will contain all the values of `max` and `min` appended during the iterations, which in this case are [99999899, 99999999, -99999998]. The counter `t` keeps track of the number of iterations, which is 2 based on the given information.
