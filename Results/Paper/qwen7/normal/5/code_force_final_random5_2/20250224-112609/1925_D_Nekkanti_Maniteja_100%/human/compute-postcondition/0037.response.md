Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `k`
   - `m` is `k`
   - `u` is an integer from input
   - `v` is an integer from input
   - `f` is an integer from input
   - `a` is `a` plus `f`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < m`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `k` and `m` is `k`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `m`.
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `k + 1`.
   - Therefore, `m` must remain `k` for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` changes from `k` to `k + 1`.
   - `m` remains `k`.

6. **State the updated conditions**:
   - `u` is still an integer from input.
   - `v` is still an integer from input.
   - `f` is still an integer from input.
   - `a` is still `a` plus `f`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `m` is `k`, `u` is an integer from input, `v` is an integer from input, `f` is an integer from input, `a` is `a` plus `f`**
