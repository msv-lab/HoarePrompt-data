Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating over the number of test cases `t` and processing each one individually.

2. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input for each test case, extracting `n`, `m`, and `k` from the first line and the friendship details from the subsequent `m` lines.

3. **Modular Inverse Calculation**: The calculation of the modular inverse `c` of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo \(10^9 + 7\) is correct. This is used to normalize the probability of picking any pair of children.

4. **Sum Calculation**: The sum `a` of all `f_i` values is correctly calculated.

5. **Expected Value Calculation**: The expected value `s` is calculated using the formula \(k \cdot c \cdot (k-1) \cdot c \cdot m + k \cdot c \cdot a\). This formula is derived from the problem statement and correctly accounts for the expected increase in friendship values due to the excursions.

6. **Modulo Operation**: The final result is correctly taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
