Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input.
   - It then processes `m` lines of input, each containing `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`.

2. **Calculation of Combinations**:
   - The variable `c` is calculated as the modular multiplicative inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children (`n * (n - 1) // 2`) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - This is done using `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)` which computes \(c\) such that \(c \cdot \text{(total pairs)} \equiv 1 \pmod{M}\).

3. **Sum of Friendship Values**:
   - The variable `a` accumulates the sum of all friendship values `f_i` for the pairs of friends.

4. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The loop iterates `k` times, updating the sum `s` with the formula `c * i * c * m + c * a`.
   - This formula seems to be an attempt to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values, but it is incorrect.

5. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - The final result `s % M` is printed, which ensures the result is within the required range.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Combinatorial Inverse**: The calculation of `c` is correct. It is used to convert probabilities into expected values.
- **Sum of Friendship Values**: The variable `a` correctly accumulates the sum of friendship values.
- **Expected Value Formula**: The formula `c * i * c * m + c * a` is incorrect. The expected value of the sum of friendship values should be calculated differently. Specifically, the expected value of the sum of friendship values after `k` excursions should consider the probability of picking each pair and the increase in friendship value over time.
- **Final Output**: The output is correctly taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Correct Solution Approach:

The correct approach involves calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion. The expected value for each pair of friends being chosen in any excursion is \(\frac{k}{\text{total pairs}}\), and the expected increase in friendship value for each pair of friends over `k` excursions is \(\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\).

### Conclusion:

Given the incorrect formula in the provided solution, the program does not correctly solve the problem.

**Correctness: **False**
