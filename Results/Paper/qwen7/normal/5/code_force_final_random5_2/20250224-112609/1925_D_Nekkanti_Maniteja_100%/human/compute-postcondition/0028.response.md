Output State: **`i` is `m + 1`, `k` is equal to `m`, `s` is `m * (c * i * c * m + c * a)`, `M` is `10`, `c` is `(pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, 10))**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `c` to the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `n`, `c` is updated to the value of `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, 10)`. The other variables (`i`, `k`, `s`, and `M`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
