Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: According to the given information, `i` is initially set to 0.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. Therefore, the loop will start executing if `i < m` is true.

4. **Adjust the required states**:
   - `i` should be 0 to start the loop.
   - `m` must be a positive integer because `i` starts at 0 and the loop will continue as long as `i < m`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `m`.

State: **`i` is 0, `m` must be a positive integer**
