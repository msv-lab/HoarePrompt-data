Output State: **`i` is `m + 1`, `k` is equal to `m`, `s` is `m * (c * i * c * m + c * a)`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers obtained from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state, and `s` remains unchanged as well since no operation was performed on it within the given code snippet. The initial values of `i` and `k` are still valid, and `s` is calculated using the updated value of `m`.
