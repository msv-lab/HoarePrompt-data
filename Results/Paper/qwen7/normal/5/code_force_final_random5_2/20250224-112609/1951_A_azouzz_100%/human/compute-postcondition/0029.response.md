Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string. If the number of occurrences of '1' in `s` (denoted as `cnt1`) is greater than 2 and even, then `cnt1` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `cnt1` is less than or equal to 2 or odd, it is set to 0. If `cnt1` is 1, it remains 1. If `cnt1` is greater than 1, it is set to 0 if '11' does not exist in `s` or if the number of occurrences of '1' in `s` is odd.
