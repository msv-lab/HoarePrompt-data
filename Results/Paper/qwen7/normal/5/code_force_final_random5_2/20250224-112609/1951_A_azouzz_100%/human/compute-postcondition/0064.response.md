The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to filter folder names that are digits within a specified range where `start` and `end` are integers such that `start` is less than or equal to `end`. However, since the function does not accept any parameters, it cannot perform this task as described.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and therefore cannot filter folder names based on the specified range.**
