Postcondition: `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new string input by the user, `cnt1` is the number of '1's in the new string `s`. If the number of '1's (`cnt1`) in the string `s` is greater than 2, then the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. Otherwise, the postcondition remains the same as the else part, meaning `cnt1` is the number of '1's in the new string `s`.
