Postcondition: `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new string input by the user, `cnt1` is the number of '1's in the new string `s`. If the string `s` contains the substring '11', the function does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `s`, and `cnt1`. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `n`, `s`, and `cnt1` remain unchanged.
