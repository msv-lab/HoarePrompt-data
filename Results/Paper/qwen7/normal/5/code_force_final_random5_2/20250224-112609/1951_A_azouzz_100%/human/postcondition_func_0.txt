The function reads multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` and a string `s`. It then checks the number of '1's in the string `s`. Based on the count of '1's and their arrangement, it prints either 'YES' or 'NO'. Specifically, if the count of '1's is greater than 2 and even, it prints 'YES'; if the count is greater than 2 but odd, or if there are exactly two consecutive '1's, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function ends.
