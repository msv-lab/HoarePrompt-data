Postcondition: `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a new string input by the user, `cnt1` is the number of '1's in the new string `s`. If the substring '11' is found in `s`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. Otherwise, `cnt1` is the number of '1's in the new string `s`.
