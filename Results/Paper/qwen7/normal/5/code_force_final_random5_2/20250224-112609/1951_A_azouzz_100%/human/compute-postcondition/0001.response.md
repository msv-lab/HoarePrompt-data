Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `t`**: The initial state given is that `t` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. If `t` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the state accordingly**: Since the loop depends on `t` being greater than 0, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
