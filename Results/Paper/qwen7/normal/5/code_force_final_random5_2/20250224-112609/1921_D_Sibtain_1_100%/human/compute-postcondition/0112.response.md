Output State: **`k` is 1, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`, `ans` is `ans + max(abs(a[i] - c[i]), abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j]))**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `t2` to be the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Specifically, `k` remains 1, `t1` remains the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, and `ans` is updated to include the maximum of `t1` and the newly calculated `t2`.
