Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), followed by pairs of integers (n, m) and (a_i, b_i) for each test case. For each test case, it checks if 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^5 and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. It then returns information based on the values of n, m, a_i, and b_i for each test case.**

This functionality describes a function that iterates through multiple test cases, each containing specific integer values, and performs validations and operations based on these values without accepting any parameters directly.
