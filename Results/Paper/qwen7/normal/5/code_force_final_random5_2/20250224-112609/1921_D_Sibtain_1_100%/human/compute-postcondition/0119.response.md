Output State: **`k` is 2, `ans` is `ans + max(abs(a[i] - c[i]), t2)`, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `abs(a[i] - c[i])` to `t1`. This updates the value of `t1` but does not affect the other variables. The value of `ans` remains unchanged from its initial state, except that it now includes the updated `t1` in its expression. The value of `t2` remains unchanged.
