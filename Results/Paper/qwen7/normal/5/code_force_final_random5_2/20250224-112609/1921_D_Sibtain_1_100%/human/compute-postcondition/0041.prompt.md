Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `num_tests` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq num\_tests \leq 100\); `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split by space; `m` is an integer obtained from the second input split by space; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the third input split by space and converted to integers using map(int, input().split()); `c` is a list of integers obtained from the fourth input split by space and converted to integers using map(int, input().split()); `c` is sorted in non-decreasing order (before the code) and then sorted in non-increasing order; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for k in range(len(a)):
    t1 = abs(a[i] - c[i])
    t2 = abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])
    if t2 > t1:
        j += 1
    else:
        i += 1
    ans += max(t1, t2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `k` is 0 and must be less than the length of `a`, `num_tests` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq num\_tests \leq 100\), `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split by space, `m` is an integer obtained from the second input split by space, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the third input split by space and converted to integers using map(int, input().split()), `c` is a list of integers obtained from the fourth input split by space and converted to integers using map(int, input().split()), `c` is sorted in non-decreasing order (before the code) and then sorted in non-increasing order, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either 1 or 2, `ans` is `max(t1, t2)`, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `c[0]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[-1]` and `c[-1]`. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `j` is 2; otherwise, `j` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `k` is either 1 or 2, `num_tests` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq num\_tests \leq 100\), `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split by space, `m` is an integer obtained from the second input split by space, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the third input split by space and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`, `c` is a list of integers obtained from the fourth input split by space and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`, `c` is sorted in non-decreasing order (before the code) and then sorted in non-increasing order, `i` is either 0 or 1, `j` is either 1 or 2, `ans` is `ans + max(t1, t2)`, where `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `c[i]`, and `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[-1]` and `c[-1]` (or `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]` depending on the condition).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `k` is 2, `ans` is `max(t1, t2)`, `i` and `j` are incremented based on the condition. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `j` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `i` is increased by 1, and `t2` remains as the absolute difference between `a[len(a) - j]` and `c[len(c) - j]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
