Output State: **`k` is `len(a) - 2`, `ans` is `ans + max(t1, t2)`, `i` is either 2 or 3, `j` is 3, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, and `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 3] - c[len(c) - 3])`.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given that `i` was either 1 or 2, after the increment, `i` will be either 2 or 3. All other variables (`k`, `ans`, `j`, `t1`, and `t2`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
