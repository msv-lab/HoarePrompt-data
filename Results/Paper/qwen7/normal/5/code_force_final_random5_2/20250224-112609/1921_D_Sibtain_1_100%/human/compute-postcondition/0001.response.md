Output State: **`num_tests` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq num_tests \leq 100\); `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split by space; `m` is an integer obtained from the second input split by space.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. The value of `num_tests` remains unchanged.
