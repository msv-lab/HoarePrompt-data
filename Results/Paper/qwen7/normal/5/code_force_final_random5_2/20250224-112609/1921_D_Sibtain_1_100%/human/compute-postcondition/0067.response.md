Output State: **`k` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is `ans + max(t1, t2)`, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is either 2 or 3, `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`, and `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[len(c) - 1])`. If `t2` is greater than `t1`, then `i` is 1 and `j` is 3. Otherwise, `i` is 2 and `j` is 2.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by adding the maximum of `t1` and `t2` to its current value. The other variables (`k`, `i`, `j`, `t1`, and `t2`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The conditions for `i` and `j` based on the comparison between `t1` and `t2` also remain valid.
