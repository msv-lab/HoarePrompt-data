Output State: **`k` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is `ans + 2 * max(t1, t2) + max(t1, t2)`, `i` is either 2 or 3 (depending on the condition `t2 > t1`), `j` is either 3 or 4, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 3] - c[len(c) - 3])`**.

Explanation: The line `ans += max(t1, t2)` adds the maximum of `t1` and `t2` to `ans`. Given the initial conditions, `ans` was initially `ans + 2 * max(t1, t2)`. After executing the line of code, `ans` is updated to `ans + 2 * max(t1, t2) + max(t1, t2)`, which simplifies to `ans + max(t1, t2)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
