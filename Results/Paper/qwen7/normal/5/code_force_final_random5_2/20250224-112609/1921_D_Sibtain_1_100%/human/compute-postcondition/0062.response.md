Output State: **`k` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` contains the cumulative maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `t1` is `abs(a[0] - c[0])`, `t2` is `abs(a[len(a) - 1] - c[len(c) - 1])`.**

Explanation: The code `j += 1` increments the value of `j` by 1. Initially, `j` was 2, so after executing this line, `j` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
