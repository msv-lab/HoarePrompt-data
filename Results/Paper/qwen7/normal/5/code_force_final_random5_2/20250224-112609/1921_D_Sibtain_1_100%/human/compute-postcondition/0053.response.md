Based on the initial state provided:

- `k` is equal to the length of the sorted list `a`.
- `ans` contains the cumulative maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration.
- `i` and `j` have been appropriately incremented, and the loop has completed all iterations.
- `c` is a list of integers obtained from input sorted in reverse order.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- The set of `a` and `c` are singletons with the same element, so `ans`, `i`, `j`, `c`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.

Given these conditions, we know that `a` and `c` both contain a single element since they are described as singletons with the same element. Let's denote this common element as `x`.

Therefore, `a[0]` is `x` and `c` is a list containing `x` (since it is sorted in reverse order, it still contains only `x`).

The expression inside the `print` statement is:

```python
max(abs(a[0] - max(c)), abs(a[0] - min(c)))
```

Since `c` is `[x]`, `max(c)` is `x` and `min(c)` is also `x`. Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

```python
max(abs(x - x), abs(x - x))
```

Which further simplifies to:

```python
max(0, 0)
```

Thus, the result is `0`.

Output: **0**
