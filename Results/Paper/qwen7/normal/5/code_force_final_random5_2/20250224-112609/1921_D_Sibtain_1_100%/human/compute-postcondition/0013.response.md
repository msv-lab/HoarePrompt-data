The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. All the variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`num_tests` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq num\_tests \leq 100\); `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split by space; `m` is an integer obtained from the second input split by space; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the third input split by space and converted to integers using map(int, input().split()); `c` is a list of integers obtained from the fourth input split by space and converted to integers using map(int, input().split()); `c` is sorted in non-decreasing order (before the code) and then sorted in non-increasing order. The length of list `a` is 1.**
