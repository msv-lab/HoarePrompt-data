Output State: **`num_tests` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq num\_tests \leq 100\); `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split by space; `m` is an integer obtained from the second input split by space; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the third input split by space and converted to integers using map(int, input().split()); `c` is a list of integers obtained from the fourth input split by space and converted to integers using map(int, input().split()); `c` is sorted in non-decreasing order (before the code) and then sorted in non-increasing order; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; `ans` is 0.**

In this state, the variables `num_tests`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `c` retain their initial values and conditions. The new variables `i`, `j`, and `ans` are initialized to 0, 1, and 0 respectively.
