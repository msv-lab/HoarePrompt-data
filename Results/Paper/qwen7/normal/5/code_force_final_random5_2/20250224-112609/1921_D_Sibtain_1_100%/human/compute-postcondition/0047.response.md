Output State: **`k` is equal to the length of the list `a`, `ans` contains the cumulative maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration, `i` and `j` have been appropriately incremented, and the loop has completed all iterations, `c` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `c = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and converts them into a list of integers. The values of `k`, `ans`, `i`, `j`, `a`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states. After executing this line of code, `c` is updated to be a list of integers obtained from the input.
