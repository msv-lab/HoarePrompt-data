The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables directly. The states of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is 0, `ans` is the sum of `max(t1, t2)` for each iteration from `k=len(a)-1` down to `k=1`, `i` is the final value determined by the loop's conditions, `j` is the final value determined by the loop's conditions, `t1` is `abs(a[i] - c[i])` with `i` being the last updated index, `t2` is `abs(a[n - m] - c[m - 1])`, `a` is a list of integers inputted by the user, `n` and `m` are integers inputted by the user, `c` is a list of integers inputted by the user.**
