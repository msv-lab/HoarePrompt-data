Postcondition: **`k` is equal to the length of the list `a`, `ans` contains the cumulative maximum of `t1` and `t2` for each iteration, `i` and `j` have been appropriately incremented, and the loop has completed all iterations. Additionally, `c` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, and if the sets of `a` and `c` are singletons with the same element, then no additional changes are made to `ans`, `i`, `j`, `c`, `n`, and `m`.**
