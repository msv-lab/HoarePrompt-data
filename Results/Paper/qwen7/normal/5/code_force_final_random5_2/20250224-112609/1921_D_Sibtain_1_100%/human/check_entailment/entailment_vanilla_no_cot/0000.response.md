Correctness: **True**

The provided solution correctly addresses the problem. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why:

1. **Edge Cases Handling**: The code handles the edge case where both arrays `a` and `c` contain identical elements, resulting in a total difference of 0.
   
2. **Sorting and Pairing Strategy**: The code sorts `a` in ascending order and `c` in descending order. This ensures that the largest possible differences are considered first, which aligns with the goal of maximizing the total difference.

3. **Iterative Calculation**: The loop iteratively pairs elements from the sorted lists and calculates the maximum difference between corresponding elements, accumulating the result in `ans`.

4. **Handling Single Element Arrays**: There is a special handling for when `a` or `c` contains only one element, ensuring the code works correctly even in these scenarios.

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the logic in the function appears to be sound and should produce the correct results for the given test cases.
