Output State: **`k` is 0 and must be less than the length of `a`, `num_tests` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq num\_tests \leq 100\), `n` is an integer obtained from the first input split by space, `m` is an integer obtained from the second input split by space, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the third input split by space and converted to integers using map(int, input().split()), `c` is a list of integers obtained from the fourth input split by space and converted to integers using map(int, input().split()), `c` is sorted in non-decreasing order (before the code) and then sorted in non-increasing order, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `ans` is 0, `t1` is the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `c[0]`, `t2` is the absolute difference between `a[-1]` and `c[-1]`, and `t2` is less than or equal to `t1`.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
