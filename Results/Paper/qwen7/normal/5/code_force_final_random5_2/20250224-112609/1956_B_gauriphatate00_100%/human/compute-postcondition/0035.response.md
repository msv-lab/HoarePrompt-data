Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `num` and `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `max_score` is 1
   - `num` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 2
   - `num` is in `count_a`

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates over `num` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`.
   - For the next iteration, `num` will be incremented by 1.

4. **Update the State**:
   - Since `num` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 3 for the next iteration.
   - The condition for the loop to continue (`n > num`) must still hold true. Given that `n` must be greater than 2, and `num` will now be 3, `n` must be greater than 3.

5. **Final State**:
   - `max_score` remains 1 (unchanged by the loop).
   - `num` is now 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 3.
   - `num` (which is now 3) must still be in `count_a`.

Therefore, the updated state for the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`max_score` is 1, `num` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, and `num` (which is 3) is in `count_a`**.
