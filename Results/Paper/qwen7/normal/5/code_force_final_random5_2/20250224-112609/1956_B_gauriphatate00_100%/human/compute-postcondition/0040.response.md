Output State: **The final value of `max_score` is 2, `num` is n, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, and `num` (which is n) is in `count_a`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `max_score` will be 2, `num` will be equal to the final value of `n`, `n` must be at least 3, and `num` (which is now `n`) must be present in the `count_a` dictionary with a value of 2.
