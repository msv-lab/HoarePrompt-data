### Reasoning:

The provided code snippet does not accurately reflect the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Calculating Maximum Score:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the maximum score by checking how many numbers appear exactly twice in the list `a`. However, this logic is flawed because it does not consider the optimal strategy that Nene would use to minimize your score.
   - According to the problem statement, Nene will always try to maximize her score while minimizing yours. This means that if a number appears twice in your hand, Nene will ensure that both instances are placed on the table before you can benefit from them.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Nene's Strategy:**
   - The function does not simulate Nene's optimal strategy. Instead, it simply counts the occurrences of each number in your hand and adds to the score if a number appears exactly twice. This approach does not account for the fact that Nene will always place cards on the table to prevent you from scoring points.

3. **Incorrect Final Score:**
   - The function always returns 2, which is incorrect. For example, in the test case where `a = [1, 1, 2, 3]`, the correct maximum score for you is 1, not 2. The function should dynamically calculate the score based on the optimal moves of both players.

Given these issues, the provided function does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

### Correctness:
**False**

The provided code does not correctly simulate the optimal strategy of both players and thus does not produce the correct results.
