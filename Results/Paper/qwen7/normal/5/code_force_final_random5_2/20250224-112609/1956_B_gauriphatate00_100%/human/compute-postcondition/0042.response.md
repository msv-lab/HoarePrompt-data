Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n`. The length of `a` is `n`, and each integer from 1 through `n` appears in `a` at most 2 times. The function returns 2.**

This means the function `func_1` takes a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` as inputs, where the list `a` contains exactly `n` integers, and each integer from 1 to `n` appears no more than twice in the list. Regardless of the contents of the list, the function always returns the integer 2.
