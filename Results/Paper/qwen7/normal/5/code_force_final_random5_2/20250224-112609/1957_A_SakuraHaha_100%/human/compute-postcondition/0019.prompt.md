Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of that element in `a`, and `x` is the last element from the list `a` with `cnt[x]` incremented by 1.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` and `n` will retain their initial values, `a` will be the same list of integers it started with (though `cnt` will have been updated), and `ans` will still be 0. The dictionary `cnt` will contain the count of each integer in the list `a`. The variable `x` will be the last element of the list `a`, and its count in `cnt` will be incremented by 1 compared to its previous count.
Code of the loop:
for x in cnt.values():
    ans += x // 3


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `ans` is `ans + x // 3`, `cnt` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of that element in `a`, and `x` is the last element from the list `a` with `cnt[x]` incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `ans` is `ans + x // 3 + x // 3`, `cnt` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of that element in `a`, and `x` is the next element from `cnt.values()` with `cnt[x]` incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `ans` is `ans + x // 3 + x // 3 + x // 3`, `cnt` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of that element in `a` (with the count of the current `x` incremented by 1), and `x` is the next element from `cnt.values()`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
