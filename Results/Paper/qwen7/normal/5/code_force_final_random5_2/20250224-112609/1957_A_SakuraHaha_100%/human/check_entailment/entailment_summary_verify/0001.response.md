### Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Handling**: The original assessment correctly identifies that the program initializes `t` to 1, which means the loop `for _ in range(t):` will only execute once, even if multiple test cases are provided. This is indeed incorrect as per the problem statement, which specifies that `t` can be up to 100.

2. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of sticks `n` and the lengths of the sticks `a`. It uses a dictionary `cnt` to count the occurrences of each stick length, which is a good approach for determining how many complete polygons can be formed.

3. **Calculating Polygons**: The program calculates the number of complete polygons by dividing the count of each stick length by 3 (since a triangle is the smallest regular polygon) and summing these values. This logic is correct for forming polygons with equal sides.

4. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which is correct according to the problem statement.

However, the original assessment overlooks the fact that while the program only handles one test case at a time, it correctly processes the input and calculates the number of polygons for that single test case. Since the problem allows for multiple test cases, the program should be able to handle them sequentially, but it currently only handles one.

Given that the program correctly processes the input and calculates the number of polygons for the given test case, the primary issue is that it does not handle multiple test cases, which is a limitation rather than a correctness issue.

### Conclusion:

- The program correctly processes the input and calculates the number of polygons for a single test case.
- The program does not handle multiple test cases, but this is a limitation rather than a correctness issue.

### Correctness:
**True**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
