#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the following list contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of that element in `a`, and `x` is the last element from the list `a` with `cnt[x]` incremented by 1.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` and `n` will retain their initial values, `a` will be the same list of integers it started with (though `cnt` will have been updated), and `ans` will still be 0. The dictionary `cnt` will contain the count of each integer in the list `a`. The variable `x` will be the last element of the list `a`, and its count in `cnt` will be incremented by 1 compared to its previous count.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `ans` is `ans + sum(cnt.values())`, `cnt` is a non-empty dictionary where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of that element in `a` (with the count of the current `x` incremented by 1 for each iteration), and `x` is the last element from the list `a` with `cnt[x]` incremented by the total number of iterations.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: len(a)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list of integers `a` and calculates the sum of counts of each integer in the list divided by 3. It then prints the result of this calculation. The function does not return any value but modifies the internal state by updating the dictionary `cnt` with the count of each integer in the list. The function reads the length of the list and the list itself from standard input.
