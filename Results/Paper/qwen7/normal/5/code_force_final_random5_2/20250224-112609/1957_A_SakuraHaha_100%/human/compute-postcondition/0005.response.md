Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for x in a:`. The variables involved here are `x` and `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `x` is an element from the list `a` during each iteration of the loop.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list `a`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `a` is not empty.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `a` is a list of integers, we need to ensure that `a` is not empty for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `x` will take on the value of each element in the list `a` during each iteration, but we don't need to specify its initial value since it will be set by the loop itself.

Given the above points, we need to ensure that the list `a` is not empty for the loop to execute.

**Final State**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is an empty dictionary**

This ensures that the loop can start executing, as the list `a` must contain at least one element.
