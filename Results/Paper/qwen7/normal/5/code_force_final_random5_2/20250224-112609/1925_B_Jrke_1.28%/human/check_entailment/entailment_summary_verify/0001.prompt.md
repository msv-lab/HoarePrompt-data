You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = map(int, input().split())
        k = x // n
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
            if x % i == 0:
                l = [ans]
                if i <= k:
                    l.append(i)
                if x // i <= k:
                    l.append(x // i)
                ans = max(l)
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \(x\) and \(n\). For each \(x\), it finds the largest divisor that is less than or equal to \(k = x // n\). If no such divisor exists, it considers the smallest prime factor of \(x\). The function outputs the maximum of these values found across all test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n`.

2. **Initial Calculation:**
   - It calculates `k = x // n`, which represents the initial guess for the difficulty of each sub-problem.
   - If `k == 1`, it directly prints `1` because the GCD of any set of numbers where each number is `1` is `1`.

3. **Finding Maximum Balance:**
   - If `k > 1`, the program enters a loop to find the maximum possible GCD.
   - The loop iterates over odd numbers starting from `1` up to `sqrt(x)` (inclusive).
   - For each odd number `i` that divides `x`, it checks two conditions:
     - If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, it considers `i` as a potential GCD.
     - If `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, it considers `x // i` as a potential GCD.
   - It keeps track of the maximum GCD found.

4. **Output:**
   - After finding the maximum GCD, it prints the result.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Handling `k == 1`:**
   - If `k == 1`, the program correctly prints `1`. This is correct because the GCD of `n` ones is `1`.

2. **Finding Maximum GCD:**
   - The loop iterates over odd divisors of `x` up to `sqrt(x)`.
   - It correctly considers both `i` and `x // i` as potential GCDs if they are less than or equal to `k`.
   - The maximum of these values is stored and printed, which ensures the maximum possible GCD is found.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case when `k == 1` correctly.
   - The loop only considers odd divisors, which is sufficient because even divisors would have been considered in previous iterations if they existed.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance of the problemset. It handles all specified conditions and edge cases appropriately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
