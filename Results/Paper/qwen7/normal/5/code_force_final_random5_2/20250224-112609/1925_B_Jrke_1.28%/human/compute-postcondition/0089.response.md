Output State: **`i` is incremented by 2, `l` is updated to `[ans, ans, i]`, and `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `ans = max(l)` assigns the maximum value from the list `l` to the variable `ans`. Since the initial conditions state that `l` is `[ans, ans, i]`, the value of `ans` is already present in `l`, and thus `ans` remains unchanged. The values of `i` and `l` remain as per the initial postconditions.
