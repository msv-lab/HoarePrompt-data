You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = map(int, input().split())
        k = x // n
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
            if x % i == 0:
                l = [ans]
                if i <= k:
                    l.append(i)
                if x // i <= k:
                    l.append(x // i)
                ans = max(l)
        print(ans)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, x and n are positive integers such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        x, n = map(int, input().split())
        
        k = x // n
        
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        
        ans = 1
        
        for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
            if x % i == 0:
                l = [ans]
                if i <= k:
                    l.append(i)
                if x // i <= k:
                    l.append(x // i)
                ans = max(l)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `x` will be reduced to its smallest prime factor if possible, otherwise `x` will be 1. `n` will be defined and non-zero. `ans` will hold the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`. The variable `i` will be the last odd number checked before the loop terminates. Since the loop processes each `x` independently, the final state of `ans` will be the maximum of all such maximum divisors found for each `x` processed. The variable `l` is no longer explicitly used but the logic implies that `ans` captures the maximum value from the list of factors considered.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after processing all test cases, `ans` will contain the highest maximum divisor found for any `x` that was less than or equal to `k` for that particular `x`, and `x` will be its smallest prime factor or 1 if no prime factor was found.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \(x\) and \(n\). For each \(x\), it finds the largest divisor that is less than or equal to \(k = x // n\). If no such divisor exists, it considers the smallest prime factor of \(x\). The function outputs the maximum of these values found across all test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `x` is a prime number and `n` is greater than `x // 2`. In such cases, the GCD of the sub-problems' difficulties cannot be greater than 1 because the only divisors of a prime number are 1 and itself. However, the program might incorrectly output a value greater than 1 in these scenarios.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
7 4
```
The expected output is `1` because the maximum balance is achieved when the difficulties are `[2, 2, 2, 1]`, resulting in a GCD of `1`. However, the program might output a value greater than `1` due to its current logic.

To fix this, the program needs to check if `x` is a prime number and adjust the output accordingly when `n > x // 2`.
