Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `x` is reduced to its smallest factor greater than 1 if it has any, otherwise `x` is 1; `k` is `x // n`; `ans` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
    if x % i == 0:
        l = [ans]
        if i <= k:
            l.append(i)
        if x // i <= k:
            l.append(x // i)
        ans = max(l)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is reduced to its smallest factor greater than 1 if it has any, otherwise `x` is 1; `n` is defined and non-zero; `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, where `l` is updated to include `x // i` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `l` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `x` is reduced to its smallest factor greater than 1 if it has any, otherwise `x` is 1; `n` is defined and non-zero; `ans` is the maximum value in the list `[ans, ans]`, which simplifies to `ans`; `i` is the next even or odd number depending on the current value of `x`, and `l` contains the value `ans` and the value of `x // i` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `x` is reduced to its smallest factor greater than 1 if it has any, otherwise `x` is 1; `n` is defined and non-zero; `ans` is the maximum value in the list `[ans, ans]`, which simplifies to `ans`; `i` is the next even or odd number depending on the current value of `x` plus 2; `l` now contains the value `ans` and the value of `x // (i + 2)`, and if `i <= k`, `l` now has an additional element `i`; if `x // i <= k`, `x` is further divided by `i` and the result is appended to `l`; `ans` is updated to the maximum value in list `l`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
