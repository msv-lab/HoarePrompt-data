Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, and `ans` is 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
    if x % i == 0:
        l = [ans]
        if i <= k:
            l.append(i)
        if x // i <= k:
            l.append(x // i)
        ans = max(l)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `i` is 1 + (1 if `x` % 2 == 0 else 0), `x % 2 == 0` is a boolean indicating whether `x` is even, the loop runs up to int(`x` / 2), `l` is a list containing the value 1 and `i`, if `x % i == 0`, then `l` is updated with `x // i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `i` is \(i + 2\), `x \% 2 == 0` is a boolean indicating whether `x` is even, the loop runs up to `int(x)`, and `l` is a list containing the elements `ans`, `i`, and `x // i`. If `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `l` includes the element `x // i` and `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l` after updating it. If `x // i` is greater than `k`, then `l` does not include the element `x // i` and `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l` after the operation `max(l)` is performed, `i` is incremented by 2, `x \% 2 == 0` is a boolean indicating whether `x` is even, the loop runs up to `int(x)`, and the list `l` is updated to `[ans, i + 2]` with `l.append(x // i)` added to it if `x // i <= k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
