Output State: **`x` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is an integer such that the remainder of `x` divided by `i` is 0, `l` is a list containing at least one element 'ans' and an additional element `x // i`, and `i` is less than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `x // i` (integer division of `x` by `i`) to the list `l`. Since `i` divides `x` without leaving a remainder, `x // i` is an integer. The other conditions and values of the variables remain unchanged.
