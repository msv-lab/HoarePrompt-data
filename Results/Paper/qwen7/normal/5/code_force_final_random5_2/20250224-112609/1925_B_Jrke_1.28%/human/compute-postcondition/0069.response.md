Postcondition: `x` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is an integer such that the remainder of `x` divided by `i` is 0, and `l` is a list containing at least one element `ans`, where `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, the condition does not change the value of `ans`.
