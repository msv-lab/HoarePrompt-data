Output State: **`x` is the new input integer, `n` is the new input integer divided by the old `x`, all other variables retain their previous values.**

Explanation: The code `x, n = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input and assigns them to `x` and `n` respectively. It does not affect the values of `t`, `k`, `ans`, `i`, and `x % 2 == 0`. The value of `n` is updated to be the new input integer divided by the old `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
