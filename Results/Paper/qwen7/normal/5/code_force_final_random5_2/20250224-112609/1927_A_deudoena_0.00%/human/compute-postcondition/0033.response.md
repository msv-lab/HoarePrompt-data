Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `ind2` is `i`, and if `inpstr[-(i + 1) - 1]` is equal to 'B', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `inpstr[-(i + 1) - 1]` is not equal to 'B', the conditions remain the same without any changes.**

Explanation: The code assigns the current value of `i` to `ind2`. The value of `i` remains `i + 1` from the initial state, and the condition involving `inpstr` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects these updates while keeping the original conditions intact.
