Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `ind2` is `i + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement. Since the `break` statement does not modify any variables, it only indicates that the loop or if statement is exited. The values of `i` and `ind2` remain as they were before the `break` statement was executed.
