Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `inpstr` is the input string**.

Explanation: The code `inpstr = input()` reads a string from the input and assigns it to the variable `inpstr`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as the input is not used to modify `t`. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and the descriptions about `n` and `s` remain valid but are not affected by this line of code.
