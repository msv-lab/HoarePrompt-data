Output State: **`j` is a string that is not equal to 'B', `i` is incremented by 1 from the previous value, and `ind1` is equal to the new value of `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it is within, but it does not change the values of `j`, `i`, or `ind1`. They retain their previous states with `j` being a string not equal to 'B', `i` being incremented by 1 from its previous value, and `ind1` holding the new value of `i`.
