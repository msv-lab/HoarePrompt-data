Output State: **`number` is 255, `i` is 8, `size` is 8, `sequence` contains `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(255 - (1 << 8) + 1, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])`**.

This means that after the code executes, `number` remains 255, `i` remains 8, `size` remains 8, and `sequence` remains `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`. The function `func_1` is called with the arguments `255 - (1 << 8) + 1` and `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, and the return value of this function call is stored in `result`.
