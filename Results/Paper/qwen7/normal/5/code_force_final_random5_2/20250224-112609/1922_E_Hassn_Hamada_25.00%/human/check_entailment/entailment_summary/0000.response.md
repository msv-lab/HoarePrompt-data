Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of integers such that the number of increasing subsequences in this sequence equals the input `number`. This is achieved by recursively constructing the sequence and adjusting its values.

2. **Base Case**: When `number` is 0, the function correctly returns 0, indicating that no elements need to be added to the sequence.

3. **Sequence Construction**: The function calculates the size of the sequence needed based on `number` using a binary search-like approach. It then fills the sequence with integers from 0 to 7. This step ensures that the sequence can have the desired number of increasing subsequences.

4. **Recursive Call**: The function makes a recursive call with a modified `number` value, which helps in further refining the sequence to meet the exact count of increasing subsequences required.

5. **Adjusting Sequence Values**: After the recursive call, the function adjusts the values in the sequence to ensure that the total number of increasing subsequences matches the input `number`.

6. **Output**: The main program prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself. For certain values of `X`, the generated sequence will indeed have exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

Given the execution summary and the detailed reasoning above, the function `func_1` appears to correctly implement the logic to generate a sequence with the specified number of increasing subsequences. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
