Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(size)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `size`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `number` is 255
   - `i` is less than `size` (8)
   - `size` is 8
   - `sequence` is modified based on the value of `result` and `i`
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(255 - (1 << 8) + 1, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < size`. Since `size` is 8, the loop will continue as long as `i < 8`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 from its current value.
   - `size` remains unchanged as it is a constant value set to 8.

Given that `i` is currently less than `size`, it will still be less than `size` after incrementing `i` by 1, provided `i` is not already equal to `size - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` will be incremented by 1.
- `size` remains 8.

Since `i` was less than `size` before, after incrementing `i` by 1, `i` will still be less than `size` unless `i` was already `size - 1`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`number` is 255, `i` is less than 8, `size` is 8, `sequence` is modified based on the value of `result` and `i`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(255 - (1 << 8) + 1, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])`**.

However, to explicitly state the updated values for `i`:
- If `i` was 7 before, it will be 8 after incrementing.
- If `i` was less than 7, it will still be less than 8 after incrementing.

For clarity, let's assume `i` was 7 before (the maximum value it could have been):

State: **`number` is 255, `i` is 8, `size` is 8, `sequence` is modified based on the value of `result` and `i`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(255 - (1 << 8) + 1, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])`**.
