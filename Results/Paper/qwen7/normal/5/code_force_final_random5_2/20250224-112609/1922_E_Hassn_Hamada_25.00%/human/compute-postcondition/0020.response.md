Output State: `number` must be at least 255, `i` is 8, `size` is 8, `sequence` contains `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.

Explanation: After 6 iterations, the loop condition `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number` is no longer satisfied when `number` is 255, so the loop terminates. At this point, `i` will be 8 because the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < size`, and `size` is 8. The `sequence` list will contain the numbers from 0 to 7 because the loop appends each `i` to the list during its execution.
