Output State: **number is a positive integer; sequence is a list of integers where all elements are within the range [-10^9, 10^9]; the size of generated sequence is an integer returned from the function.**

The code defines a function that generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number. However, the actual implementation of the function is not provided. Therefore, after the function call, the `number` remains a positive integer, the `sequence` remains a list of integers within the specified range, and the function returns the size of the generated sequence as an integer.
