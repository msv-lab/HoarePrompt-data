Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Generating Increasing Subsequences:**
   - The function `func_1` attempts to generate a sequence that results in a specific number of increasing subsequences. However, the logic inside `func_1` is flawed.
   - The approach used in `func_1` does not guarantee that the generated sequence will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. It seems to be trying to construct a sequence using powers of 2, but this does not align with the requirement of having exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

2. **Handling of Test Cases:**
   - The main loop reads the test cases and calls `func_1` to generate the sequence. However, the output format is incorrect. The program prints the length of the sequence followed by the sequence itself, but it does not handle the case where no such array exists (i.e., when `-1` should be printed).

3. **Assertions and Assumptions:**
   - The assertions in `func_1` are not necessary and do not contribute to solving the problem. They may even cause the program to fail if the assumptions are not met.

### Example of Correctness Failure:
For the input `X = 13`, the expected output is:
```
5
2 2 3 4 2
```
However, the provided program might produce an incorrect sequence or fail to produce any sequence at all.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to use a more sophisticated algorithm to ensure that the generated sequence has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. This typically involves combinatorial mathematics and dynamic programming techniques.
