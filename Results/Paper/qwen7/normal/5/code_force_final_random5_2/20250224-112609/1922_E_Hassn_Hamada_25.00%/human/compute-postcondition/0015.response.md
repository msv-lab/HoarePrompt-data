Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `size`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < size`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `number` must be at least 255 (this variable is not in the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
   - `size` is 8 (this variable is in the loop head, so it may change).
   - `i` is 1 (this variable is in the loop head, so it may change).
   - `sequence` contains `[0]` (this variable is not in the loop head, so it remains unchanged).

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1 and `size` is 8, the condition `i < size` is true, so the loop can continue.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2.
   - `size` remains unchanged at 8.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`number` must be at least 255, `i` is 2, `size` is 8**
