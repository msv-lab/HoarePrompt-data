Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `number` must be at least 255; `size` is 8.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `size` as long as `(1 << size + 1) - 1` is less than or equal to `number`. After each iteration, `size` increases by 1. Given that after 3 iterations `number` must be at least 63 and `size` is 6, we can deduce the condition for the loop to continue. Each iteration effectively doubles the threshold value of `number` that needs to be met to continue the loop. Therefore, after 4 iterations, `number` must be at least \(127\) more than the previous threshold (63), making it at least \(127 + 63 = 190\). After 5 iterations, it must be at least \(127 + 190 = 317\), but since the next power of 2 minus 1 that fits within the given range is 255, `number` must be at least 255 for the loop to continue. After 6 iterations, `size` would be 8, and the loop would terminate because the condition `(1 << 8 + 1) - 1 > number` would no longer be satisfied with `number` being 255.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(size):
    sequence.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `number` must be at least 255, `size` is 8, `i` is 1, `sequence` contains `[0]`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `number` must be at least 255, `i` is 3, `size` is 8

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `number` must be at least 255, `i` is 5, `size` is 8, `sequence` contains the element 4




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
