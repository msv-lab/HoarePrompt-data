First, let's determine the value of `result`. The function call is `func_1(255 - (1 << 8) + 1, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])`.

- Calculate `255 - (1 << 8) + 1`: 
  - `1 << 8` is `256`.
  - So, `255 - 256 + 1` equals `-1 + 1` which is `0`.

Thus, the function call simplifies to `func_1(0, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])`.

Assuming `func_1` returns the index of the first element in the list that is greater than or equal to the input number (which is `0`), `func_1` would return `0` because the first element `0` is equal to the input number.

So, `result` is `0`.

Now, let's execute the line of code:
```python
sequence[-result - i - 1] += result
```
Given `result` is `0` and `i` is `8`, the line becomes:
```python
sequence[-0 - 8 - 1] += 0
```
This simplifies to:
```python
sequence[-9] += 0
```
Since `sequence` is initially `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` and we are trying to access `sequence[-9]`, which is out of bounds, this operation does not modify `sequence` because Python does not allow such out-of-bounds access without raising an error. However, since no error is mentioned and the operation does not change the sequence, we assume it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`number` is 255, `i` is 8, `size` is 8, `sequence` is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], `result` is 0.**
