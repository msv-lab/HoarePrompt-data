Output State: `pos` remains -1, `i` is 9, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations (i.e., for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`), if `k` was found in the array `arr`, `pos` would have been updated to the index where `k` was found. Since the loop has completed all iterations without finding `k` in `arr`, `pos` remains -1. The variable `i` will be equal to `n` after the last iteration, but since the loop updates `i` within the range of `range(n)`, the final value of `i` seen in the output state is `n-1`. However, as per the given format, we represent it as `i` is 9 (assuming `n` is 10 based on the pattern, though `n` is generally not specified, it's understood to be the upper limit of the loop).
