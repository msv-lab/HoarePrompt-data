Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. Specifically, the function `func_3` is designed to find the position of the number `k` in the permutation `arr` and then perform at most two swaps to ensure that `p_l` (which is `p[0]` in the binary search context) is equal to `x`. However, the implementation of the binary search is flawed.

In the binary search part of the function, the condition `st.add(mid)` is unnecessary and does not affect the outcome. More importantly, the logic for determining whether to swap elements is incorrect. The binary search should update `l` and `r` based on the comparison of `arr[mid]` with `k`, but the current implementation does not properly handle the conditions to ensure that `p_l` becomes `x`.

Here is an example where the program fails:
- Input:
  ```
  6 3
  6 5 4 3 2 1
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  1 6
  2 3
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  0
  ```

In this case, the number `3` is present in the permutation, but the program does not perform any swaps and incorrectly outputs `0`, which means it does not rearrange the permutation to make `p_l` equal to `x`.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and is thus incorrect.
