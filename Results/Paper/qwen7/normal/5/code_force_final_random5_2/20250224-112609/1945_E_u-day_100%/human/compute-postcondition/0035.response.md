Postcondition: **`low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `pos` remains -1, `i` is 9, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`, and the set `st` contains the values `(0 + n) // 2` and `mid`. If `arr[mid] > k`, then `high` is updated to `mid`. Otherwise, `low` is updated to `mid`.**
