Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`**.

Explanation: The code `arr = func_2()` assigns the return value of `func_2()` to the variable `arr`. Since the initial values of `n` and `k` are determined by the function `func_1()`, these values remain unchanged. The only new variable introduced is `arr`, which now holds the result of `func_2()`.
