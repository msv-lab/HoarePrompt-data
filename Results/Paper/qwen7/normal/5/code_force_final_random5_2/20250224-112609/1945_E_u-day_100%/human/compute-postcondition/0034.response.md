Output State: **`low` is `mid`, `high` is `n`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `pos` remains -1, `i` is 9, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`, and the set `st` contains the values `(0 + n) // 2` and `mid`.**

Explanation: The line `low = mid` updates the value of `low` to be equal to `mid`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
