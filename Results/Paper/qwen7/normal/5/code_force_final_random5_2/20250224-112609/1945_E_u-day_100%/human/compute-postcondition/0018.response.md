Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `pos` remains -1, `i` is 9, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`, and an empty set `st` is created.**

The code creates an empty set named `st`, which does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `low`, `high`, `pos`, `i`, `n`, `k`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
