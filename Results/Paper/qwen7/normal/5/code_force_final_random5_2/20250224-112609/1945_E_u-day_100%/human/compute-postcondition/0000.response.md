Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and the values of `n` and `k` are the results of the function `func_1()`.**

This means that the function `func_1()` has been called, and it has returned two values: one for `n` and one for `k`. The initial conditions about `n` and `k` still hold, but their specific values are now determined by the function's output.
