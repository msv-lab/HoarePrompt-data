Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the current state:

The `while` loop condition is:
```python
while low + 1 < high:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The current state before the loop is:
- `low` is 0
- `high` is `n`
- `pos` remains -1
- `i` is 9
- `n` is a positive integer
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n
- `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`
- An empty set `st` is created

For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `low + 1 < high` must be true.

Currently:
- `low` is 0
- `high` is `n`

Since `n` is a positive integer, `high` (which is `n`) is greater than `low` (which is 0). Therefore, the condition `low + 1 < high` is already satisfied.

No adjustments are needed for the variables `low` and `high` because the loop condition is already met with the current values.

The other variables (`pos`, `i`, `k`, `arr`, and `st`) do not affect the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state right before the loop remains unchanged.

State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `pos` remains -1, `i` is 9, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`, and an empty set `st` is created.**
