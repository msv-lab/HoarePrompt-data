Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `mid`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `pos` remains -1, `i` is 9, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`, and the set `st` contains the values `(0 + n) // 2`, `mid`, and `mid`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `high` to be equal to `mid`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `high` is now `mid`, while `low`, `mid`, `pos`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, and `st` retain their original values.
