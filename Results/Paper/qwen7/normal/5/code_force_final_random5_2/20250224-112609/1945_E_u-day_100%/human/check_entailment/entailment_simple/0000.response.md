Reasoning:
1. The problem requires rearranging the permutation `p` using at most 2 swaps so that the element `x` is at position `l` after performing a binary search.
2. The provided code does not actually perform any swaps or rearrange the permutation `p`. Instead, it performs a binary search and prints the position of `x` if it finds it, or prints a single swap if `x` is not found.
3. The logic inside `func_3()` does not ensure that the element `x` is moved to the correct position `l` before performing the binary search. It simply performs a binary search on the original permutation without any modifications.
4. Since the problem statement specifies that the solution should involve rearranging the permutation with at most 2 swaps, the current implementation does not meet the requirements.

Correctness: **False**
