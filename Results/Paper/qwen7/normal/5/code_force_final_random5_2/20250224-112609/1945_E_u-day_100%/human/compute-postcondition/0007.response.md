Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state after the previous iteration**:
   - `pos` remains -1 (unchanged).
   - `i` remains 0 (unchanged).
   - `n` is a positive integer (unchanged).
   - `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n (unchanged).
   - `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()` (unchanged).

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is a positive integer.

4. **Update the state**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0 and `n` is a positive integer, the loop can execute again if `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `pos` remains -1 (unchanged).
   - `i` changes from 0 to 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `k` remains unchanged.
   - `arr` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`pos` remains -1, `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`**.
