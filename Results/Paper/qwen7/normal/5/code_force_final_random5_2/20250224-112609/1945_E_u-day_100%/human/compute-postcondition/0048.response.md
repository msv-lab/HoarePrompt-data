Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Understanding `low` and `high`:**
   - `low` is either the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, or it is equal to `high` if `low + 1` equals `high` and `arr[low] <= k`.
   - `high` is `n` if the loop exits because `low + 1` equals `high` and `arr[low] <= k`.

2. **Understanding `mid`:**
   - `mid` holds the last calculated midpoint value.
   - The set `st` contains the values `(0 + n) // 2`, `mid` from the second iteration, and `mid` from the third iteration.

3. **Understanding `pos` and `i`:**
   - `pos` remains -1.
   - `i` is 9.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\).
   - `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`.

4. **Condition `arr[low] == k` is false:**
   - This means that `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.

Given these details, let's determine the values for `low + 1` and `pos + 1`:

- Since `pos` is -1, `pos + 1` is 0.
- The value of `low + 1` depends on the definition of `low` and `high`. Given that `high` is `n` and `low + 1` equals `high` when `arr[low] <= k`, and since `arr[low] != k`, `low` must be `n - 1` (because `high` is `n` and `low + 1` equals `high`).

Therefore, `low + 1` is `n`.

Combining these results, the print statement will output:
Output: **n, 0**
