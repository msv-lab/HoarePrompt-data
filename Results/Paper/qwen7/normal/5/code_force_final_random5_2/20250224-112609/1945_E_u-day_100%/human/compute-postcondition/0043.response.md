Output State: `low` is either `mid` from the last iteration where `arr[mid] <= k`, `high` is `n` if `low + 1` equals `high` and `arr[low] <= k`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2` from the last iteration, `pos` remains -1, `i` is 9, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`, and the set `st` contains the values `(0 + n) // 2`, `mid` from the second iteration, and `mid` from the third iteration. The set `st` will contain all the mid values calculated during the iterations of the loop.

This means that after all iterations, the variable `low` will be the largest index such that `arr[low] <= k`, or it will be equal to `high` if `low + 1` equals `high` and `arr[low] <= k`. The variable `high` will be `n` if the loop exits because `low + 1` equals `high` and `arr[low] <= k`. The variable `mid` will hold the last calculated midpoint value. The set `st` will contain all the midpoints calculated during the iterations of the loop.
