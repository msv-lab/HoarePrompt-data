Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required solution. The program attempts to find the position of `k` in the array using binary search, but it does not actually perform the necessary swaps to ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x` after the binary search. Instead, it prints the index of the element found during the binary search, which does not satisfy the requirement of rearranging the array with at most two swaps.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should identify the positions of `x` and the two elements that need to be swapped to bring `x` to the beginning of the array, and then perform the swaps accordingly. The current implementation does not address this requirement.
