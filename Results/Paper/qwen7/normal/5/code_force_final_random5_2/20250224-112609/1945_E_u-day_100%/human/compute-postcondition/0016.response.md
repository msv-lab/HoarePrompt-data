Output State: **pos remains -1, i is 9, n is a positive integer, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and arr is the result of the function func_2().**

Explanation: The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`. After the loop has executed all its iterations (i.e., `i` reaches `n-1`), the value of `i` will be `n-1`. Given that the loop updates `pos` only when it finds `k` in `arr`, and no `k` was found in the first 3 iterations, `pos` will remain `-1` even after all iterations. The variable `n` and the array `arr` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
