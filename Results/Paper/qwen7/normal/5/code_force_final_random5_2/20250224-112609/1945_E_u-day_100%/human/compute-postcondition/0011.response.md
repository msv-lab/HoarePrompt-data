Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `pos` remains -1 (unchanged).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\).
   - `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(n)`, meaning it will run from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 2.

5. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
   - Since `n` is a positive integer and `i` is incremented to 2, the loop will execute if `2 < n`.

6. **States to Adjust:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `i`.
   - The value of `i` will be incremented to 2.

7. **Other Variables:**
   - `pos` remains -1 (unchanged).
   - `n` remains a positive integer (unchanged).
   - `k` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\) (unchanged).
   - `arr` remains the result of the function `func_2()` (unchanged).

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

**State: **`pos` remains -1, `i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`**.
