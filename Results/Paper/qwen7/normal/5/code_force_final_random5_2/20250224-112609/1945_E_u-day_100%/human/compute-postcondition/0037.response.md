Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is greater than 1, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `pos` remains -1, `i` is 9, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`, and the set `st` contains the values `(0 + n) // 2` and `mid`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mid` to be the floor division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2. However, since the initial value of `high` is greater than 1, the exact numerical value of `mid` cannot be determined without knowing the specific value of `high`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
