### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to rearrange a permutation using at most 2 swaps so that the binary search algorithm finds the target value `x` at the `l`-th position when it ends.

2. **Binary Search Algorithm**: The binary search algorithm is defined with the following steps:
   - Initialize `l = 1` and `r = n + 1`.
   - While `r - l > 1`, calculate `m = ⌊(r + l) / 2⌋`.
   - If `p_m <= x`, set `l = m`. Otherwise, set `r = m`.

3. **Goal**: We need to ensure that `p_l == x` after the binary search is executed. This means we need to place `x` in the position where the binary search would find it.

4. **Swapping Strategy**:
   - **Case 1**: If `x` is already in the permutation, no swaps are needed.
   - **Case 2**: If `x` is not in the permutation, we need to find the closest element to `x` and swap it with `x`. After the first swap, we might need to swap again to ensure `x` is in the correct position.

5. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The provided code does implement the logic to find the correct position for `x` using at most 2 swaps.
   - The code uses a dictionary `num_indx` to map each element in the permutation to its index.
   - It then performs a binary search-like process to find the correct position for `x`.
   - If `x` is not in the permutation, it finds the nearest element to `x` that is not already marked as seen and swaps it with `x`.
   - It ensures that the binary search will find `x` at the correct position.

6. **Detailed Breakdown**:
   - **Line 7**: `num_indx = {num: indx + 1 for (indx, num) in enumerate(p)}`: Creates a dictionary mapping each element in the permutation to its index.
   - **Lines 9-18**: Performs a binary search-like process to find the correct position for `x`.
   - **Lines 19-23**: Checks if `x` is already in the correct position (`p[left] == x`). If so, prints `0` indicating no swaps are needed.
   - **Lines 24-27**: If `x` is not in the correct position and has not been seen yet, prints `1` and performs the first swap.
   - **Lines 28-32**: If `x` is still not in the correct position after the first swap, prints `2` and performs the second swap.

7. **Correctness**:
   - The code correctly implements the logic to find the correct position for `x` using at most 2 swaps.
   - The binary search-like process ensures that the correct position is found.
   - The swapping logic ensures that `x` is placed in the correct position for the binary search to find it.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final:
**True**
