Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `a` is a 4x4 matrix of integers entered by the user. We don't know the specific values, but we know it's a 4x4 matrix.
- `x` is a list of the first element from each of the 4 lists in `a`. So, `x` will have 4 elements, each being the first element of one of the rows in `a`.
- `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`.

The print statement calculates `dx * dx`, where `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`.

Since we do not have the specific values of `a`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `dx`. However, we can describe the expression that will be evaluated.

Output: **dx * dx (where dx is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list x, and x contains the first element from each of the 4 lists in the 4x4 matrix a)**
