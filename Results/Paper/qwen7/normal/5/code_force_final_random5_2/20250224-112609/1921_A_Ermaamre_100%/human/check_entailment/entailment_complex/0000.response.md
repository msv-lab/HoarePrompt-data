Reasoning:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads an integer `t` which indicates the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates `(x_i, y_i)`.

2. **Extracting X-coordinates**: It extracts the x-coordinates of the four points into a list `x`.

3. **Calculating Width**: It calculates the width of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (`dx = max(x) - min(x)`).

4. **Calculating Area**: The area of the square is then calculated as `dx * dx` and printed.

Given the constraints and the guarantees in the problem statement (that the points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area), the program should work correctly for all valid inputs.

Since the program follows the correct steps to calculate the area of the square and handles the input and output as specified, the provided solution is correct.

Correctness: **True**
