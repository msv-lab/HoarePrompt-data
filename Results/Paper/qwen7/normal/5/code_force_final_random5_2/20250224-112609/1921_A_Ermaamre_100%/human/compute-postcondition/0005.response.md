Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of 4 lists, each containing integers inputted by the user.
- `x` is a list containing the first element from each of the 4 lists in `a`.
- `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`.

Let's break down the steps:

1. `x` is a list with 4 elements, each being the first element from one of the sublists in `a`.
2. `dx` is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`.

When the code `print(dx * dx)` is executed, it will print the square of `dx`.

Since the exact values of the integers inputted by the user are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `dx`. However, we can describe the output in terms of the values involved.

Output: **dx * dx (where dx is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list x)**
