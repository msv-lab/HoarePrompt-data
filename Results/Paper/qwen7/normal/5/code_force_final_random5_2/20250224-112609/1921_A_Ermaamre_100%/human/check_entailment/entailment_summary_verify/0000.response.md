### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given the coordinates of the corners of a square in random order.
   - The square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes.
   - We need to find the area of the square.

2. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function reads multiple sets of coordinates from the user.
   - It calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates.
   - It prints the square of this difference, which is the area of the square.

3. **Key Points to Validate**:
   - The function correctly identifies the side length of the square by calculating the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates.
   - Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the difference in both x and y coordinates will be the same, representing the side length of the square.
   - Squaring this difference gives the correct area of the square.

4. **Guarantees in the Problem Description**:
   - It is guaranteed that the given points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.
   - This ensures that the coordinates provided will always form a valid square.

Given these points, the function correctly implements the logic to find the area of the square. The original assessment is accurate because the program correctly calculates the area by identifying the side length through the difference in x-coordinates and squaring it.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the function summary provided.
