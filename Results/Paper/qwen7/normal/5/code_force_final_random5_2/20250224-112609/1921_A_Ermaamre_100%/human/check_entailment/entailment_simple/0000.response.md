Reasoning:

The provided code correctly identifies the side length of the square by finding the maximum and minimum x-coordinates among the four corner points. This approach works because the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, meaning the differences in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates will give the side lengths of the square.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The code reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates.

2. **Coordinate Extraction**: It extracts the x-coordinates into a list `x` and calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (`dx`). Since the square's sides are parallel to the axes, this difference represents the side length of the square.

3. **Area Calculation**: The area of the square is calculated as `dx * dx`, which is then printed.

Given the constraints and guarantees in the problem statement, this approach will correctly identify the side length and compute the area for each test case. The code does not make any assumptions about the order of the coordinates, only that they form a square with sides parallel to the axes.

Therefore, the provided code meets the requirements and is correct.

Correctness: **True**
