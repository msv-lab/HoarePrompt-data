Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is a 4x4 matrix of integers entered by the user, `x` is a list of the first element from each of the 4 lists in `a`, `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `dx` as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`. The values of `t`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables stay the same, and only `dx` is updated based on the values in `x`.
