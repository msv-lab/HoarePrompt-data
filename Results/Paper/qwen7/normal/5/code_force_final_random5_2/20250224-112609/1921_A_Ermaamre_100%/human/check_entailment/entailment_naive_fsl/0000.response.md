Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the maximum difference in the x-coordinates and the maximum difference in the y-coordinates will be equal, representing the side length of the square. The program computes the side length by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (or y-coordinates), and then squares this value to get the area. Given the constraints and guarantees in the problem description, the program handles all potential cases correctly.
