### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Input and Output:**
   - The program needs to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners.
   - It is guaranteed that the points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and have a positive area.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - `t = int(input())`: This reads the number of test cases.
   - `for _ in range(t)`: This loop runs for each test case.
   - `a = [[int(x) for x in input().split()] for i in range(4)]`: This reads the coordinates of the four corners of the square into a list of lists `a`.
   - `x = [p[0] for p in a]`: This extracts the x-coordinates of the points into a list `x`.
   - `dx = max(x) - min(x)`: This calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates, which gives the side length of the square.
   - `print(dx * dx)`: This prints the area of the square, which is the side length squared.

3. **Verification:**
   - The logic for calculating the side length of the square is correct because the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes.
   - The area calculation (`dx * dx`) is also correct.

Given the problem constraints and the code logic, the program correctly computes the area of the square for any valid input.

### Correctness:
**True**
