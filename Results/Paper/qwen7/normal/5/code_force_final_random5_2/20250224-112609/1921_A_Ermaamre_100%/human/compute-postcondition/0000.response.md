Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state information about the coordinates of the corners of a square remains unchanged because no operations are performed on those values. The only change is that `t` now holds the integer input from the user.
