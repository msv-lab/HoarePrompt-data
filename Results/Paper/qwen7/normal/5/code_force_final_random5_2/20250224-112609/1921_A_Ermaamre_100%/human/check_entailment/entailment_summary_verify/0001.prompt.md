You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = [[int(x) for x in input().split()] for i in range(4)]
        x = [p[0] for p in a]
        dx = max(x) - min(x)
        print(dx * dx)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple sets of coordinates from the user, where each set represents the corners of a square. For each set, it calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates, squares this difference, and prints the result. The function does not return any value but prints the calculated results for each set of coordinates.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Input and Output:**
   - The program needs to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners.
   - It is guaranteed that the points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and have a positive area.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - `t = int(input())`: This reads the number of test cases.
   - `for _ in range(t)`: This loop runs for each test case.
   - `a = [[int(x) for x in input().split()] for i in range(4)]`: This reads the coordinates of the four corners of the square into a list of lists `a`.
   - `x = [p[0] for p in a]`: This extracts the x-coordinates of the points into a list `x`.
   - `dx = max(x) - min(x)`: This calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates, which gives the side length of the square.
   - `print(dx * dx)`: This prints the area of the square, which is the side length squared.

3. **Verification:**
   - The logic for calculating the side length of the square is correct because the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes.
   - The area calculation (`dx * dx`) is also correct.

Given the problem constraints and the code logic, the program correctly computes the area of the square for any valid input.
