Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of 4 lists, each containing integers inputted by the user.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `a` which consists of 4 sublists, each of which is generated by splitting a line of input into integers. Since the exact values are not provided, we keep the condition that `t` must be greater than 0 and note that `a` is now a list of 4 lists of integers.
