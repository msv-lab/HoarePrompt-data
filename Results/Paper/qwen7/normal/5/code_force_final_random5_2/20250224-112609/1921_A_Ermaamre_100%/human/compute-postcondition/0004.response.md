Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list of 4 lists, each containing integers inputted by the user; `x` is a list containing the first element from each of the 4 lists in `a`; `dx` is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `x`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `x`. The list `x` contains the first element from each of the four lists within `a`. The calculation `max(x) - min(x)` is stored in the variable `dx`. The values of `t`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged.
