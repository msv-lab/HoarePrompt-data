Output State: All integers in the list `N` have been processed, and for each unique integer `k` in `N`, `M[k]` contains the count of how many times `k` appears consecutively in the list without any integer between them. If an integer `k` does not appear consecutively, it will not be present in the dictionary `M`.

In more detail, `cur` will be the last integer processed, and `M` will contain entries for each integer in `N` that starts a new sequence (i.e., where `num > cur`), with the value being 1, and for those that continue a sequence (i.e., where `num <= cur`), the value will be the count of consecutive occurrences.
