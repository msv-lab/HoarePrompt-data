Output State: **`cur` is the same, `i` is `i + 1`, `S` is an input integer, `N` and `M` remain unchanged**.

The code `S = int(input())` assigns the integer value of the user's input to the variable `S`. The other variables (`cur`, `i`, `N`, and `M`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, `cur` remains the same, `i` is incremented by 1, `S` now holds the integer value of the user's input, and `N` and `M` remain unchanged.
