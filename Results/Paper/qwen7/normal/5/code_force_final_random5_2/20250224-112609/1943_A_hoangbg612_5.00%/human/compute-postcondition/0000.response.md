Output State: **`T` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4**.

This means that `T` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer input from the user. The precondition that `T` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 2 * 10^4 remains valid after the code execution. All other preconditions and variables remain unchanged.
