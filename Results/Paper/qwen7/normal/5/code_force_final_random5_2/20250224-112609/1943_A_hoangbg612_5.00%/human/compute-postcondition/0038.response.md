Output State: **`num` is the next integer from the list `N`, `cur` is 5, `M[5]` is 2**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `M[cur]` by 1. Given that `cur` is initially 4 and `M[4]` is either 1 or 2, after executing `M[cur] += 1`, `M[4]` will become 2 or 3. Since `cur` is updated to 5 (implying the next index), `cur` becomes 5 and `M[5]` is initialized to 2. Therefore, the updated states are as mentioned.
