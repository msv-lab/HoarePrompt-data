Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    S = int(input())
    N = list(map(int, input().split()))
    N.sort()
    cur = -1
    M = {}
    for num in N:
        if num > cur:
            if num > cur + 1:
                cur += 1
                break
            cur = num
            M[cur] = 1
        else:
            M[cur] += 1
    if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S:
        cur += 1
    for i in range(cur):
        if M[i] <= i:
            cur = i
            break
    print(cur)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The value of `cur` remains 0, and `i` ranges from 0 to the number of iterations minus 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `cur` will be the smallest index `i` in `M` such that `M[i] > i`, or it will be the largest index in `M` if no such index exists. The state of `i` will be the last index checked before breaking out of the loop, or the length of `M` if the loop completes without breaking. `S` and `N` will remain unchanged from their initial states, and `M` will remain a list of integers where the index bounds are respected.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `cur` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and it is the smallest index `i` such that `M[i] > i`, or it is equal to the length of `M` if no such index exists.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
