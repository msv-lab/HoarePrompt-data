Postcondition: **`N` is a sorted list of integers. `cur` holds the last maximum value encountered in the list `N`, and `M[cur]` is the count of how many times this maximum value appears in the list `N`. For any other value less than `cur`, the count in `M` will be incremented by 1 for each occurrence. The sum of all counts in `M` is equal to `S`.**
