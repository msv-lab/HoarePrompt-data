Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `num` is the next element in the list, `cur` is incremented by 1, and `M[cur]` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional block it was in, without changing the values of `N`, `num`, `cur`, or `M[cur]`.
