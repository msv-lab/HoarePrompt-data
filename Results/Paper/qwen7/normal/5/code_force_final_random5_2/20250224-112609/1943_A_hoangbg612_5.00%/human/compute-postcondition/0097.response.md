Output State: **`cur` is 0, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `num` is the next element in `N`, and `M[cur]` is 1**.

Explanation: The code `cur += 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1. Given that the initial value of `cur` is `-1` or the current value of `num`, after executing the code, `cur` becomes `0`. The values of `_`, `S`, `N`, `num`, and `M[cur]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
