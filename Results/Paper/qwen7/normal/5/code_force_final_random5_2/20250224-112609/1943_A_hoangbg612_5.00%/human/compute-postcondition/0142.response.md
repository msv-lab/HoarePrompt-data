Output State: **`cur` is `num`, `N` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element.**

Explanation: The code sets `cur` to the value of `num`. The value of `N` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The condition mentioned in the initial state (if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, then the current value of `cur` is set to `cur + 1`) is not relevant here since `cur` is directly assigned the value of `num` without checking any conditions.
