Postcondition: **After executing the if-else block, the dictionary `M` will map each unique integer from the list `N` to the number of consecutive occurrences of that integer where no integer in between is greater than `cur + 1`. If no such sequence exists, `M[cur]` will hold the count of consecutive occurrences of `cur` until the end of the list. If the sum of all values in `M` equals `S`, `cur` is increased by 1.**
