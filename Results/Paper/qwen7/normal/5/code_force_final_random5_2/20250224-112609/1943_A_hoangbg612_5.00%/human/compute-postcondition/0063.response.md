Output State: **The value of `cur` remains 0, and `i` ranges from 0 to the number of iterations minus 1.**

Natural Language Description: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `cur` remains unchanged at 0 because the condition `M[i] <= i` is always true for `i` starting from 0. Therefore, the loop breaks immediately on the first iteration and does not increment `cur`. The variable `i` takes on values from 0 up to but not including the total number of iterations, which in this case is 3. However, since the loop breaks on the first iteration, `i` effectively only reaches 0. Thus, `i` will be 0 after all iterations, and `cur` will still be 0.
