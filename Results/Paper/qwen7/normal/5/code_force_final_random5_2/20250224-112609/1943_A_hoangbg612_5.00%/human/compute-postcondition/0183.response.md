Output State: **`cur` is equal to `i`, `i` is equal to `i_prev + 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `cur` and `i`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement it is within. The value of `i` remains `i_prev + 2` from the initial state, and `cur` remains equal to `i`.
