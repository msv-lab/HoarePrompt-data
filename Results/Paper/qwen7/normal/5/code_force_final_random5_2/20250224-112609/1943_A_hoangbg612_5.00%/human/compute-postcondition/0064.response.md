Based on the initial state provided:

- The value of `cur` remains 0.
- The variable `i` ranges from 0 to the number of iterations minus 1, but `cur` does not change during these iterations.

Since `cur` is explicitly stated to remain 0 and no operations are performed on `cur` within the given code snippet, the value of `cur` when the `print` statement executes will still be 0.

Output: **0**
