Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `cur`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` ranging from `0` to `cur - 1`. Therefore, `i` must be initialized to `0` at the start of the loop.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `cur`**: The value of `cur` determines the upper limit of the loop. It must be a non-negative integer, and it should be the same as the initial value of `cur` after the if-else block has executed.

4. **Consider the Dictionary `M` and List `N`**: Although these variables are not directly used in the loop head, they influence the behavior of the loop indirectly through the condition `sum(M.values()) == S`. However, since we are only focusing on the loop head, we do not need to adjust their states here.

Given the above points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `cur`.

State: **`i` is 0, `cur` must be a non-negative integer**
