Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `cur`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for each `i` in the range from `0` to `cur-1`. This means `i` starts at `0` and increments by `1` until it reaches `cur`.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `M` is a list of integers.
   - `i` is within the bounds of `M`.
   - If the value at index `i` of `M` is less than or equal to `i`, the loop breaks.

4. **Consider the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by `1` at the end of each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i + 1` must still be within the bounds of `M`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by `1` from its previous value.
   - `cur` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise in the loop body, but since no such specification is given, we assume `cur` stays the same.
   - The condition for breaking the loop (value at index `i` of `M` being less than or equal to `i`) needs to be checked with the new value of `i`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `i` and ensure that the loop continues as long as `i` is within the bounds of `M`.

**State:**
- `M` is a list of integers.
- `i` is within the bounds of `M` and is `i + 1` from the previous value.
- `cur` remains the same.

Since the exact value of `i` from the previous iteration is not provided, we can denote it as `i_prev`. Therefore, the new value of `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`M` is a list of integers, `i` is within the bounds of `M` and is `i_prev + 1`, `cur` must be greater than or equal to `i_prev + 1`**
