Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `num` is an integer greater than the current element `cur` in the list `N`, and the current value of `cur` is `cur + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of `N`, `num`, or `cur`. It only indicates that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it was in. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged, and the only additional information is that the program has broken out of the loop or conditional statement.
