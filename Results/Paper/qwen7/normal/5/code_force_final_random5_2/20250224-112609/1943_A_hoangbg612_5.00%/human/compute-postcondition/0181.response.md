Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `cur`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < cur`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cur` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
   - If `M[i]` is less than or equal to `i`, then `cur` becomes `i`. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, let's denote the previous value of `i` as `i_prev`.
   - Therefore, at the end of the previous iteration, `i = i_prev + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `cur`. Hence, `i_prev + 1 < cur`.

5. **Determine the new value of `i` for the next iteration**:
   - The new value of `i` will be `i_prev + 2`.

6. **Determine the possible values of `cur`**:
   - If `M[i_prev + 1]` is less than or equal to `i_prev + 1`, then `cur` becomes `i_prev + 1`.
   - Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.

7. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The new value of `i` is `i_prev + 2`.
   - The value of `cur` either remains the same or changes to `i_prev + 1` depending on the condition `M[i_prev + 1]`.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `cur` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` is `i_prev + 2`.
- `cur` either remains the same or changes to `i_prev + 1` depending on the condition `M[i_prev + 1]`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `cur` without knowing the value of `M[i_prev + 1]`, we can express it as follows:

State: **`cur` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `i_prev + 2`, `cur` either remains the same or changes to `i_prev + 1` depending on the condition `M[i_prev + 1]`**.
