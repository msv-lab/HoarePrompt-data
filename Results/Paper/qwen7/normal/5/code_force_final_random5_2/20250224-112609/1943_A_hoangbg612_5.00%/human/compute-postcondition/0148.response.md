Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `num`, which iterates over the elements of the list `N`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - If `num` is greater than `cur`, then `cur` is set to `num`, and `M[cur]` is set to 1.
   - Otherwise, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `N` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element.
   - `cur` is the current maximum value encountered so far.
   - `M` is a dictionary where `M[cur]` keeps track of how many times `cur` has been encountered.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `num` is the next element in the list `N`, it must be the next integer in the sorted list.
   - If `num` is greater than `cur`, then `cur` will be updated to `num`, and `M[num]` will be set to 1.
   - Otherwise, `M[cur]` will be incremented by 1.

Given that we need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we can conclude:
- `N` remains the same as it is an external list.
- `num` will be the next element in the list `N`.
- `cur` will either be updated to `num` if `num > cur` or remain the same.
- `M[cur]` will either be incremented by 1 or set to 1 depending on the condition.

Since we don't know the exact value of `num` at the end of the previous iteration, we can represent the state as follows:

**State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers with at least one element, `num` is the next element in the list, `cur` is the current maximum value encountered so far, `M[cur]` is the count of occurrences of `cur`.**
