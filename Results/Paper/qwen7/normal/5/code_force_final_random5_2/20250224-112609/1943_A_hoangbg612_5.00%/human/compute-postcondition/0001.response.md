Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (a placeholder variable) and the variable `T`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `T` is greater than 0. Since `T` is given as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), the loop will always execute at least once.

3. **Adjust the state**: The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `T`, because the loop depends on the value of `T`. We need to ensure that `T` is greater than 0, which it already is according to the given constraints. However, since the loop will iterate `T` times, we should reflect this in the initial state.

Given the constraints and the loop structure, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect the fact that the loop will iterate `T` times.

**State:**
**`T` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, and `T` must be greater than 0**.

Since `T` is already constrained to be a positive integer, the key point here is to ensure that `T` is within the specified range and that the loop will iterate `T` times.

Therefore, the final state is:
**State: **`T` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4**.
