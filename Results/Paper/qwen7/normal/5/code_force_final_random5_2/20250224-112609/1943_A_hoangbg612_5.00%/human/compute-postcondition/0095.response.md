Postcondition: `cur` is `num` if `num` is greater than `-1`, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, and `M[cur]` is 1. Otherwise, `cur` remains `-1`, `_` is 1, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, and `num` is the second element of `N`, `M[cur]` is 1.
