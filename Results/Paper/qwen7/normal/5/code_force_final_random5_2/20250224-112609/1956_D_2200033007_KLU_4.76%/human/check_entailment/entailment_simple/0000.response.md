Reasoning:
1. The problem requires processing an array of integers and performing operations to maximize the sum of the array elements.
2. The annotated program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. Specifically:
   - The program does not read the actual input values from the user.
   - The program does not process the array `a` to maximize its sum.
   - The program directly prints fixed outputs without considering the input values.
3. The function `func_1` is called with `len(a)` as an argument, but the function itself does not use this parameter correctly to solve the problem.
4. The provided code does not handle the logic required to find the maximum sum and the operations needed to achieve it.

Given these points, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
