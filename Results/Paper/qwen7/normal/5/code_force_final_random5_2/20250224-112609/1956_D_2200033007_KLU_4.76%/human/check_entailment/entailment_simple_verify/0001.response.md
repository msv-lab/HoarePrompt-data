### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and its behavior step-by-step based on the problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the length of the array `n` and then reads the array elements into a list `a`.
   - The annotated code shows that `a` is a list of integers where the length of the list `n` satisfies \(1 \leq n \leq 18\), and each element \(a_i\) in the list satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^7\).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list `c` as input, but the actual input to this function is the length of the array `n`.
   - The function `func_1` has a hardcoded logic for different values of `n`:
     - If `n == 2`, it prints `4 1` and `1 2`, indicating that for an array of length 2, setting all elements to 2 maximizes the sum.
     - If `n != 2`, it prints `13 0`, suggesting that no operations are needed, which is correct for `n = 3` since the initial sum is already the maximum possible.
     - For `n > 3`, the function prints `13 0`, which is incorrect because the problem statement suggests that for some cases with \(n > 3\), operations might be needed to maximize the sum.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The program does not implement the logic to find the optimal sequence of operations to maximize the sum for arrays of length greater than 3.
   - The hardcoded values for `n == 2` and `n == 3` are correct, but the logic for `n > 3` is flawed.
   - The program does not handle the general case where `n > 3` correctly, as it does not provide a strategy to maximize the sum for arrays of length greater than 3.

Given these points, the code does not solve the problem correctly for all cases as specified.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array elements for all possible lengths \(n\).
