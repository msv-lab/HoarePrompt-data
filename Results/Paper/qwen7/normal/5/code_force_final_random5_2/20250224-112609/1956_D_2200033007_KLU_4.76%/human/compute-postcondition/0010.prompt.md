You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: c is a list of integers where the length of the list n satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 18, and each element a_i in the list satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
def func_1(c):
    m = 0
    if (c == 2) :
        print(f'4 1')
        #This is printed: 4 1
        print(f'1 2')
        #This is printed: 1 2
    else :
        print(f'13 0')
        #This is printed: 13 0
    #State: Postcondition: `c` is a list of integers where the length of the list n satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 18, and each element a_i in the list satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7; `m` is 0, and the list `c` is either equal to 2 or not equal to 2.
    return
    #The program does not return any value since there is no return statement in the provided code.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter c, which is a list of integers. The length of the list n satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 18, and each element a_i in the list satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7. Since there is no return statement in the provided code, the function does not return any value.

```

Return Postconditions: The program does not return any value since there is no return statement in the provided code.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
