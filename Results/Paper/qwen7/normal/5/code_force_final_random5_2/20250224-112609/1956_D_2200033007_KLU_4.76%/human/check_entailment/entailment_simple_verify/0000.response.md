### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not implement the required logic to solve the problem. Let's break down the program and the problem requirements to understand why the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Requirements:
1. Read an array of integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) of length \(n\).
2. Perform operations to maximize the sum of the elements of the array.
3. Each operation involves setting a subarray from index \(l\) to \(r\) to the MEX (minimum excluded) value of that subarray.
4. Output the maximum possible sum and the sequence of operations used to achieve this sum.

#### Provided Program:
```python
a = []
n = int(input())
sa = input()
na = sa.split()
for ai in na:
    a.append(ai)
func_1(len(a))

def func_1(c):
    m = 0
    if (c == 2) :
        print(f'4 1')
        print(f'1 2')
    else :
        print(f'13 0')
    return
```

#### Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the length of the array and the array itself correctly.
2. **Function Call**: The program calls `func_1` with the length of the array.
3. **Function Logic**:
   - If the length of the array is 2, it prints `4 1` and `1 2`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `13 0`.

#### Issues:
- **Hardcoded Outputs**: The function `func_1` prints hardcoded values based on the length of the array. This means the program does not perform any computation to determine the maximum sum or the sequence of operations needed.
- **No Computation for General Case**: For arrays of length other than 2, the program simply prints `13 0`, which is not necessarily the correct output. The maximum sum and the sequence of operations depend on the specific values in the array, not just its length.
- **No Handling of MEX Operation**: The program does not implement the logic to find the MEX value of a subarray or perform the operations to maximize the sum.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
