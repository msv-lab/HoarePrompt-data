Reasoning:
- The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not take into account the actual values of the input array `a`, nor does it perform any operations to maximize the sum of the array elements as per the problem statement.
- The function `func_1` is hardcoded to return specific outputs based on the length of the input list `c`, which is not related to the problem's requirements. For instance, when `c` has a length of 2, it prints "4 1" and "1 2", and when `c` has a length other than 2, it prints "13 0". This is not a general solution for maximizing the sum of the array elements.
- The problem requires dynamically calculating the MEX for subarrays and updating the array to achieve the maximum possible sum. The provided function does not perform any such operations.

Correctness: **False**
