Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the sum of the elements in the array by performing operations up to \(5 \times 10^5\) times.
2. The provided code does not implement the logic to find the optimal sequence of operations to maximize the sum. Instead, it uses hardcoded values for different lengths of the array.
3. Let's analyze the provided examples:
   - For `n = 2`, the code prints `4 1` and `1 2`. This suggests that for an array of length 2, setting all elements to 2 maximizes the sum, which is correct. The MEX of `{0, 1}` is 2, and setting both elements to 2 results in a sum of 4.
   - For `n = 3`, the code prints `13 0`. This suggests that no operations are needed, which is correct since the initial sum is already the maximum possible (`1 + 3 + 9 = 13`).
   - For `n > 3`, the code prints `13 0`. However, the problem statement suggests that for some cases with `n > 3`, operations might be needed to maximize the sum. For example, consider the array `[1, 100, 2, 1]`. The initial sum is `1 + 100 + 2 + 1 = 104`, but we can set the last two elements to 2, resulting in a sum of `1 + 100 + 2 + 2 = 105`. The code does not handle this case correctly.
4. The function `func_1` is not used in the main part of the code, and its purpose is unclear from the context. The main logic is hardcoded in the conditional statements without any dynamic approach to maximize the sum for different lengths of the array.
5. The original assessment correctly pointed out that the code does not solve the problem for all cases as specified. The hardcoded values do not account for the possibility of needing operations to maximize the sum for arrays of length greater than 3.

Given these points, the code does not solve the problem correctly for all cases as specified.

Final: **False**
