Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The program's logic is hardcoded for the specific case where the length of the array `c` is exactly 2, and it prints "4 1" followed by "1 2". However, the problem requires a general solution that works for any array of length `n` between 1 and 18, and it needs to maximize the sum of the elements of the array using the allowed operations.

For arrays of different lengths, the program should dynamically determine the optimal operations to maximize the sum of the elements. The current implementation does not handle other cases beyond `n = 2`, and it always prints "13 0" for any array length greater than 2, which is incorrect.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
