Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `last_year` is 4, `next_year` is 4, `a[1]` remains unchanged, `results` is a list containing the string "4", `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(data[index])` assigns the value of `data[index]` to `n` after converting it to an integer. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `data[index]`, `n` is described as an input integer. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
