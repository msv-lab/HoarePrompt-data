You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        last_year = a[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
            last_year = next_year
        results.append(str(last_year))
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer \( T \) (number of test cases), an integer \( n \) (length of the list), and a list of \( n \) integers \( a \). For each test case, it calculates the final value of `last_year` by iteratively applying the formula \((last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]\) for each element in the list \( a \). The function then stores the final value of `last_year` as a string in a list `results` for each test case and outputs these values separated by newlines.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the year in which all signs will occur sequentially. Specifically, the logic used to determine the next year for each sign is flawed. 

The program calculates the next year for each sign using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`, but this approach does not guarantee that the signs will occur in the correct sequential order. Instead, it seems to be attempting to find the next multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year + 1`, which is not the correct method for determining the next occurrence of the sign.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:
- Input: `6 3 2 4 5 9 18`
- Expected Output: `36`
- Program Output: The program incorrectly outputs a different value.

A correct approach would involve finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities to ensure that all signs occur in the correct sequential order. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        current_year = 0
        for i in range(n):
            current_year = lcm(current_year, a[i])
        results.append(str(current_year))
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()
```

This corrected program uses the least common multiple (LCM) to ensure that all signs occur in the correct sequential order, which aligns with the problem description.
