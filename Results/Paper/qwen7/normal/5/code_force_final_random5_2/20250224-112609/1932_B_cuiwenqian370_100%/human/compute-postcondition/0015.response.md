Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `last_year` is equal to `next_year`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - The condition `i < n` must still hold true, meaning `n` must be greater than 2.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `n` must remain greater than 2.
   - The state of `last_year` and `next_year` does not change because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `last_year` is equal to `next_year`**
