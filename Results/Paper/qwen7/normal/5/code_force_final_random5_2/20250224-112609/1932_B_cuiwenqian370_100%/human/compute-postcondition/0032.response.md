Output State: **`i` is 1, `last_year` is equal to `next_year`, `a[1]` remains unchanged**.

Explanation: The code `last_year = next_year` assigns the value of `next_year` to `last_year`. This means `last_year` now holds the same value as `next_year`. The values of `i` and `a[1]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
