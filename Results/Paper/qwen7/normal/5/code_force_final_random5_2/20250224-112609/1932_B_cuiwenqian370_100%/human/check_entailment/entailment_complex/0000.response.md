Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
2. It initializes the necessary variables and iterates through each test case.
3. For each test case, it calculates the year when the nth sign will occur by iteratively applying the formula \((last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]\).
4. The formula ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one.
5. After processing all test cases, it writes the results to stdout.

Given the problem description and the provided annotations, the logic in the program is sound and correctly implements the required functionality. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
