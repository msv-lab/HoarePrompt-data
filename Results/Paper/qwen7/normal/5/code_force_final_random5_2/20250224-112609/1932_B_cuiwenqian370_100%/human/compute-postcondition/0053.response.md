Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `last_year` is equal to `next_year`, `next_year` is equal to ((`last_year` + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2] * a[2])**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `next_year` based on the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, `next_year` is calculated as `((last_year + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2] * a[2])`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
