Output State: **`i` is 1; `last_year` plus 1 plus `a[1]` minus 1, all divided by `a[1]`, then multiplied by `a[1]` equals `next_year`.**

Explanation: The variable `next_year` is calculated using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`. Given that `i` is 1, the expression simplifies to `(last_year + a[1]) // a[1] * a[1]`. This means `next_year` is the value of `last_year` rounded down to the nearest multiple of `a[1]` and then multiplied back by `a[1]`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 is still valid but not directly affected by the code.
