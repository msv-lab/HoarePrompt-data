Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` must be greater than 0; `next_year` is equal to `(last_year + 1 + a[1] - 1) // a[1] * a[1]`**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `next_year` based on the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`. Given that `i` is 1, the formula simplifies to `(last_year + a[1]) // a[1] * a[1]`. The values of `last_year` and `a[1]` are not provided, so they remain as part of the expression. The other variables (`i` and `n`) retain their initial conditions.
