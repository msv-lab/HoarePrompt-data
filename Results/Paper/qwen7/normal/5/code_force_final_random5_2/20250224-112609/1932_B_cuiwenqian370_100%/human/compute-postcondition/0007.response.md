Output State: **`T` must be a positive integer, `n` is an integer from `data[index]`**.

The code assigns the value of `data[index]` (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The initial state of `T` being a positive integer is preserved, and the new state includes that `n` now holds the integer value from `data[index]`.
