Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 2, `last_year` is equal to `next_year`, `next_year` is equal to ((`last_year` + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2] * a[2]), `next_year` is equal to ((`last_year` + a[2]) // a[2] * a[2])**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `next_year` using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`. Given that `i` is 3, the expression simplifies to `((last_year + a[3]) // a[3] * a[3])`. Since `last_year` is equal to `next_year`, the new value of `next_year` is `((last_year + a[3]) // a[3] * a[3])`. All other variables remain unchanged.
