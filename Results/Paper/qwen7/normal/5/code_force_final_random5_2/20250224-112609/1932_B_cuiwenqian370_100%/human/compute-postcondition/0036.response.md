Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined as `for i in range(1, n)`. This means the loop variable is `i` and the condition for the loop to continue is `1 <= i < n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `last_year` is 3
   - `next_year` is 3
   - `a[1]` remains unchanged

3. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n)`, the loop will continue if `1 <= i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 3.
   - The value of `n` is not specified in the current state, but it must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - `n` must remain greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

5. **Final state**:
   - `i` is 3
   - `last_year` remains 3
   - `next_year` remains 3
   - `a[1]` remains unchanged

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`i` is 3, `last_year` is 3, `next_year` is 3, `a[1]` remains unchanged**
