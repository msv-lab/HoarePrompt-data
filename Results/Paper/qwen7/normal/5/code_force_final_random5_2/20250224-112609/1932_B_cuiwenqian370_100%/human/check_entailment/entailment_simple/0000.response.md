Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input data and processes each test case separately.
2. For each test case, it initializes the `last_year` with the first periodicity `a[0]`.
3. It then iterates through the remaining periodicities, calculating the next year when the next sign would occur based on the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`. This formula ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly greater than `last_year`.
4. After processing all periodicities for a test case, it appends the final `last_year` to the `results` list.
5. Finally, it writes the results to the standard output, joining the string representations of the final years with newlines.

Given the problem description and the provided annotated program, the logic appears to be correct. The program handles the input, processes each test case according to the rules, and outputs the correct results.

Correctness: **True**
