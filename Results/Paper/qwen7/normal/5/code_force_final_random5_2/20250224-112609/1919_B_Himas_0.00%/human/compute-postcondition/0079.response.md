Output State: **All test cases have been processed, `i` equals the total number of test cases (input), `s` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `s` ≤ 1000, `e` is an empty string, `q` is not defined since `e` is empty, `P` is the total count of '+' characters across all strings `e` for all test cases, and `M` is the total count of '-' or any other characters in all strings `e` for all test cases.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, which corresponds to the number of test cases specified by `t`, all input strings `e` have been processed. The variable `i` will equal the total number of test cases since it is incremented by 1 for each iteration. The string `e` will be an empty string because it has been fully processed for each test case. The variable `q` is not defined since `e` is now empty. The variables `P` and `M` will hold the cumulative counts of '+' and '-' (or any other character) across all input strings `e` for all test cases, respectively. The initial value of `s` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
