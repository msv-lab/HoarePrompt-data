Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop is iterating over each character `q` in the string `e`. Therefore, the variables involved in the loop head are `q`.

2. **Determine the state changes**: Since the loop is iterating through each character of the string `e`, the variable `q` will change to the next character in the string `e` at the start of each new iteration.

3. **Initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000
   - `i` is either 0 or 1
   - `s` is an input integer
   - `e` is a non-empty string
   - `q` is the first character of `e`
   - `P` is 1 if `q` is '+', otherwise `P` is 0
   - `M` is 1 if `q` is not '+', otherwise `M` is 0

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `q` must be the next character in the string `e`. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `s`, `e`, `P`, and `M`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

5. **New state**: After the loop advances to the next character in `e`, the new state will be:
   - `t` remains the same (an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000)
   - `i` remains the same (either 0 or 1)
   - `s` remains the same (an input integer)
   - `e` remains the same (a non-empty string)
   - `q` becomes the second character of `e`
   - `P` is 1 if `q` is '+', otherwise `P` is 0
   - `M` is 1 if `q` is not '+', otherwise `M` is 0

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is either 0 or 1, `s` is an input integer, `e` is a non-empty string, `q` is the second character of `e`, `P` is 1 if `q` is '+', otherwise `P` is 0, and `M` is 1 if `q` is not '+', otherwise `M` is 0**.
