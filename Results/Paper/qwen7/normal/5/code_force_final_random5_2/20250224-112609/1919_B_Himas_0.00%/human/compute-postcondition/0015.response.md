Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `i` is either 0 or 1, `s` is an input integer, `e` is a non-empty string, `q` is the second character of `e`, `P` is 2 if `q` is '+', otherwise `P` is 1, and `M` is 0 if `q` is '+', otherwise `M` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `P` is incremented by 1. Since `P` was initially 1 if `q` is '+' and 0 if `q` is not '+', incrementing `P` by 1 changes its value to 2 if `q` is '+' (making it 1+1) and to 1 if `q` is not '+' (making it 0+1). The value of `M` remains unchanged because it is only defined based on the value of `q` and does not get updated by the given code.
