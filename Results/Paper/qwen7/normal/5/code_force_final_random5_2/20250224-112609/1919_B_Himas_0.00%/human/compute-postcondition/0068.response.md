Output State: **`e` is a non-empty string with at least one character left, `q` is the first character of the remaining part of `e`, `P` is 0, `M` is 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `s` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The value of `M` is incremented by 1. Since `M` was initially either 0 or 1, incrementing it by 1 changes its value to 1 if it was 0, or to 2 if it was 1. However, since `M` can only be 0 or 1 according to the initial state, it must be that `M` was originally 0 and is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
