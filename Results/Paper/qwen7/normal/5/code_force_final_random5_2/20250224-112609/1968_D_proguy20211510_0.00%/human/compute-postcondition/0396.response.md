Output State: **`i` is 9; `sb` is `preb[0] + b[6] + b[9]`; `pres` is a list with the element `ss + s[7]`; `ss` is `ss + s[8]`;**

Explanation: The code `sb += b[i]` adds the value of `b[i]` (where `i` is 9) to the current value of `sb`. Since `i` is 9, `sb` is updated to `preb[0] + b[6] + b[9]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
