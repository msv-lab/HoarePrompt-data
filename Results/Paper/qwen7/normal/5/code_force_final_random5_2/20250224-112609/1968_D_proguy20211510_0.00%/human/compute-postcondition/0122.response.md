Output State: **`i` is `-1`, `sb` is the sum of all elements in list `b`, `pres` is a list containing the cumulative sums of all elements in list `s`, `ss` is the sum of all elements in list `s`, `preb` is a list containing the cumulative sums of all elements in list `b` up to each index, `ptsb` is an empty list, `ptss` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes two empty lists `ptsb` and `ptss`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `sb`, `pres`, `ss`, and `preb`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous values. The new lists `ptsb` and `ptss` are initialized as empty lists.
