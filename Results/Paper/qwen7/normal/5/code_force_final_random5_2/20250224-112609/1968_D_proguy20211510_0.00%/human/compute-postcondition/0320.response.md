Output State: **`n` is the input integer decremented by 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `pb` is the input integer, `ps` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`, `b` is a list containing two elements which are `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `maxa`, `s` is a list containing one element which is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `founds` and `foundb` are `False`, `i` is 3, and `foundb` is `True`.**

Explanation: The code appends `maxa` to the list `b`. Initially, `b` contains one element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. After appending `maxa`, `b` now contains two elements: `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `maxa`. All other variables remain unchanged. Since `i` was initially 2, after the append operation, `i` is incremented to 3.
