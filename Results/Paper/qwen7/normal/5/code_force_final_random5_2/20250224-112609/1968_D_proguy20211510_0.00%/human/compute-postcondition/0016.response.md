Output: **Bodya**

Explanation:
- The `print('Bodya')` statement directly prints the string `'Bodya'`.
- No other variables or objects need to be evaluated since the print statement does not depend on any of the described variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`) to determine its output.
