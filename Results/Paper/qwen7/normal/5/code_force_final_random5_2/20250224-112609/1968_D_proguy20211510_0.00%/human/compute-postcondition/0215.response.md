Postcondition: `founds` is a boolean indicating whether an element has been found, `foundb` is True indicating that an element matching `maxa` has been found, `i` is 3, `k` is greater than 0, `b` is a list with three elements where the first two are `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and the original element. If `foundb` is True, the third element of `b` is `maxa`, and `s` contains `a[ps - 1]` if `founds` is True, or the element from `a` that matches the conditions specified in the else part, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `foundb` is False, the third element of `b` is `a[pb - 1]`. If `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, then `b` is updated to include `a[pb - 1]` as the third element. Otherwise, `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`.
