Output State: **`i` is 12, `k` is an input integer, `rem` is `k - 13`, `ptsb` has an element equal to `preb[12] + (k - 13) * b[12]`**

Explanation: The code appends a new value to the list `ptsb`. This value is calculated as `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, where `i` is 12 and `rem` is `k - 13`. Since `k` is an input integer, `rem` is also an expression involving `k`. The value of `ptsb` is updated with this new element, but the values of `i` and `rem` remain unchanged from their initial states.
