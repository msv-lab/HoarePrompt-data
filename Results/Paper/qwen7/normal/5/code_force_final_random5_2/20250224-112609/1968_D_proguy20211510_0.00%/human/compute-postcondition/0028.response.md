Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `n`, `k` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `k`, `pb` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `pb`, `ps` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `ps`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the original string `p`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())`, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`, `b` is an empty list, `s` is an empty list, `founds` is `False`, `foundb` is `False`**.

This output state indicates that the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `b`, and `s` retain their initial values and state, and two new boolean variables `founds` and `foundb` are initialized to `False`.
