Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(len(pres))`. The only variable that changes within this loop is `i`.

2. **Determine the Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `i` is 13
   - `k` is an input integer
   - `rem` is `k - i - 1`
   - `ptsb` has an element equal to `preb[12] + (k - 13) * b[12] + preb[13] + (k - 13) * b[13]`
   - `ptss` is a list with two elements, where the first element is `pres[12] + rem * s[12]` and the second element is `pres[13] + rem * s[13]`

3. **Determine the Next State of `i`**: Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`. Therefore, `i` will be 14.

4. **Adjust the Other States**: The other states (`k`, `rem`, `ptsb`, and `ptss`) do not change based on the loop head alone. They depend on the loop body, but since no loop body is provided, we assume they remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body.

Given the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 14, `k` is an input integer, `rem` is `k - i - 1`, `ptsb` has an element equal to `preb[12] + (k - 13) * b[12] + preb[13] + (k - 13) * b[13]`, `ptss` is a list with two elements, where the first element is `pres[12] + rem * s[12]` and the second element is `pres[13] + rem * s[13]`**
