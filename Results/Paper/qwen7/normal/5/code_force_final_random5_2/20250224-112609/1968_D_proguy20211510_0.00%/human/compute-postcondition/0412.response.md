Output State: **`i` is 13, `k` is an input integer, `rem` is `k - i - 1`, `ptsb` has an element equal to `preb[12] + (k - 13) * b[12] + preb[13] + (k - 13) * b[13]`, `ptss` is a list with one element equal to `pres[12] + rem * s[12]`**.

Explanation: The code appends a new value to the `ptsb` list. The new value is calculated as `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, which translates to `preb[13] + (k - 13) * b[13]`. The value of `i` remains 13, `k` remains an input integer, `rem` remains `k - i - 1`, and `ptss` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
