Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `n`, `k` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `k`, `pb` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `pb`, `ps` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `ps`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting and converting the original string `p`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())`, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`, `b` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, and the second element is `maxa` since `foundb` is `True`, `s` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and the second element is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `founds` is `False`, `foundb` is `True`, `i` is 2, and `k` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation: The line `s.append(maxa)` appends the value of `maxa` to the list `s`. Since `s` was initially a list containing one element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, after appending `maxa`, `s` now contains two elements: `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `maxa`. All other variables remain unchanged.
