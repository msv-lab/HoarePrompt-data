Postcondition: **`founds` is a boolean indicating whether an element has been found, `foundb` is True indicating that an element matching `maxa` has been found, `i` is 3, `k` is greater than 0, `b` is a list with two elements, the first being `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and the second being the original element, and `s` contains `a[ps - 1]` if `founds` is True, or the element from `a` that matches the conditions specified in the else part, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
