Postcondition: **`maxs` is the maximum value of `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value of `ptsb`, `i` is `len(pres) - 1`, `rem` is `k - len(pres) - 1`, `ptsb` contains the cumulative sum of `preb[i] + rem * b[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `len(pres) - 1`, `ptss` contains the cumulative sum of `pres[i] + rem * s[i]` for all `i` from `1` to `len(pres) - 1`, and `maxs` is less than `maxb`.**
