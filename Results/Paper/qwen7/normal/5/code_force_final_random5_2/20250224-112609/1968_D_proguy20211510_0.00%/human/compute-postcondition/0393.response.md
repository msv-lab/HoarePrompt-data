Output State: **`i` is 8; `sb` is `preb + b[6]`; `pres` is a list with the element `ss + s[7]`; `ss` is `ss + s[8]`**

Explanation: The code `ss += s[i]` increments the value of `ss` by `s[i]`. Given that `i` is 8, `ss` is updated to `ss + s[8]`. The other variables (`i`, `sb`, `pres`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
