Output State: **`i` is 3, `rem` is `k - i - 1`, `ptsb` contains the value `preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0] + (preb[3] + rem * b[3])`, `ptss` contains the value `pres[1] + (k - 1) * s[1]`, `pres` now has an additional element `pres[i] + rem * s[i]` where `i` is 3.**

Explanation: The code appends a new value to the list `ptss`. The new value is calculated as `pres[i] + rem * s[i]`, where `i` is 3. Since `i` is 3, the new value added to `ptss` is `pres[3] + rem * s[3]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
