Output State: **`founds` is a boolean indicating whether an element has been found, `foundb` is True, `i` is equal to `k`, `k` is greater than 0, `b` is a list with `k` elements where the first element is 0, the second element is the original element, and the rest of the elements are either `maxa` or `a[pb - 1]` based on the conditions specified in the loop, `s` is a list containing either one or two elements where the first element is 0, `preb` is an empty list, `pres` is an empty list, `sb` is 0, and `ss` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes two new variables `sb` and `ss` to 0. Since no other variables are affected, the values of `founds`, `foundb`, `i`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `preb`, and `pres` remain unchanged from their initial states.
