Output State: **`i` is 3, `rem` is `k - i - 1`, `ptsb` contains the value `preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0] + (preb[3] + rem * b[3])`, `ptss` contains the value `pres[1] + (k - 1) * s[1]`, `len(pres)` must be at least 4**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `ptsb`. The new element is calculated as `preb[i] + rem * b[i]`, which translates to `preb[3] + (k - i - 1) * b[3]` since `i` is 3 and `rem` is `k - i - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
