Output State: **`i` is 4, `rem` is `k - i - 2`, `ptsb` contains the value `preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0] + (preb[3] + rem * b[3])`, `ptss` contains the value `pres[1] + (k - 1) * s[1]`, `pres` now has an additional element `pres[i] + rem * s[i]` where `i` is 4**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `rem` to `k - (i + 1)`, which means `rem` is now `k - (4 + 1)` or `k - 5`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
