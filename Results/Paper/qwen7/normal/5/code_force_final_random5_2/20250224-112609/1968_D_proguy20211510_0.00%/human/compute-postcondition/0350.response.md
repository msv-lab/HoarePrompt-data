Postcondition: **`n` is the input integer decremented by 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `pb` is either the input integer or updated to `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is the input integer or updated to `p[ps - 1]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`, `b` is a list containing three elements which are `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `a[pb - 1]` or `a[ps - 1]`, and the previous element of `b`, `s` is a list containing three elements which are `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `maxa` or `a[ps - 1]`, and the additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `founds` and `foundb` are `False`, `i` is 4, and `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa` if `founds` is `True`, otherwise `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa` if `a[ps - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`. If `foundb` and `founds` are both `True`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This postcondition summarizes the state of all variables after the if-else block executes, considering both the if and else parts.
