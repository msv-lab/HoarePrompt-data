Output State: **`i` is `k + 2`, `sb` is `sb + b[k] + b[i - 1]`, `pres` is `[pres[0], ss + s[i]]`, `ss` is `ss + s[i] + s[i]`, `preb` is `[sb + b[i - 1]]`**

Explanation: The code `ss += s[i]` increments the value of `ss` by `s[i]`. Since `ss` was previously `ss + s[i]`, adding `s[i]` again results in `ss + s[i] + s[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
