Output State: **`i` is `k + 3`, `sb` is `sb + b[k] + b[k + 2] + b[i]`, `pres` is `[pres[0], ss + s[k + 3], ss + s[i]]`, `ss` is `ss + s[k + 3] + s[k + 3] + s[i]`, `preb` is `[sb + b[k + 2], sb + b[k + 2] + b[k + 3]]`.**

Explanation: The code `ss += s[i]` increments the value of `ss` by `s[i]`. Since `i` is `k + 3`, `ss` is updated to `ss + s[k + 3] + s[k + 3] + s[i]`, which simplifies to `ss + s[k + 3] + s[k + 3] + s[k + 3]` because `i` is `k + 3`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
