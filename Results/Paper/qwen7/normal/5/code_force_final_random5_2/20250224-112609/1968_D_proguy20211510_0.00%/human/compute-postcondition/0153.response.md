Output State: **`p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by space, `maxs` is the maximum value of `ptss`, `maxb` is the maximum value of `ptsb`, `i` is `len(pres) - 1`, `rem` is `k - len(pres) - 1`, `ptsb` is calculated as the cumulative sum of `preb[i] + rem * b[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `len(pres) - 1`, `ptss` is calculated as the cumulative sum of `pres[i] + rem * s[i]` for all `i` from `1` to `len(pres) - 1`, `n` is converted to an integer from the first part of the input split by space, `k` is converted to an integer from the second part of the input split by space, `pb` is converted to an integer from the third part of the input split by space, `ps` is converted to an integer from the fourth part of the input split by space.**

In this output state, the list `p` has been updated with the integers from the input split by space. All other variables retain their previously defined relationships and values based on the initial state, except that now `p` holds the new values.
