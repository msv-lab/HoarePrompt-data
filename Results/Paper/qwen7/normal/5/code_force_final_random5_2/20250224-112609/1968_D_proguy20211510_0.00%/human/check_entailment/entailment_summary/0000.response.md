Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly handles multiple test cases, reading each test case's parameters and arrays.
2. **Max Value Check**: It correctly identifies if both players start with the maximum value in array `a` and handles the draw condition appropriately.
3. **Score Calculation**: The function attempts to calculate scores for both players over `k` turns, considering their positions and the values in array `a`.
4. **Edge Cases**: The logic for handling edge cases (both players starting with the maximum value, one player starting with the maximum value) is implemented correctly.
5. **Final Comparison**: The final comparison of the calculated scores for both players is done correctly, and the appropriate result ("Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw") is printed.

However, upon closer inspection, there are some issues with the logic for calculating the scores over `k` turns. Specifically, the current implementation does not fully account for the dynamic nature of the game where players can stay or move to the next position in the permutation `p`. The current approach seems to assume that the players will always move optimally to maximize their scores, which might not be the case.

Given the complexity of the problem, the current implementation might not handle all possible scenarios correctly. A more accurate approach would involve simulating the game for each turn, considering all possible moves for both players.

Based on the provided code and the execution summary, the current implementation has logical flaws in how it calculates the scores over `k` turns. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is questionable.

Correctness: **False**
