Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine the initial conditions at the start of the loop**:
   - `i` is 4.
   - `k` must be greater than 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < k`.

4. **Update the state based on the loop condition**:
   - Since `i` is currently 4, for the loop to continue, `k` must be greater than 4.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 in each iteration, so at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 5.
   - `k` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise in the loop body, but for the loop to continue, `k` must still be greater than 4.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `i` will be 5.
- `k` must remain greater than 4.

The other variables (`n`, `pb`, `ps`, `a`, `maxa`, `b`, `s`, `founds`, `foundb`) are not part of the loop head and thus their values do not change for the loop to continue. 

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

**State: `n` is the input integer decremented by 1, `k` must be greater than 4, `pb` is either the input integer or updated to `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is the input integer or updated to `p[ps - 1]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers, `maxa` is the maximum value in list `a`, `b` is a list containing either two or four elements depending on the condition, `s` is a list containing four elements which are `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `maxa` or `a[ps - 1]`, and the additional element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `founds` and `foundb` are `False`, `i` is 5, and `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa` if `founds` is `True`, otherwise `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa` if `a[ps - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`. If `founds` is `True`, `s` includes `maxa` as its fourth element, otherwise `s` includes `a[ps - 1]` as its fourth element.**
