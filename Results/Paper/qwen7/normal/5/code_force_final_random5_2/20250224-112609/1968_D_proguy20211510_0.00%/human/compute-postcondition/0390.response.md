Output State: **`i` is 7; `preb` includes the value of `sb + b[i-1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends `sb + b[i]` to the list `preb`. Given that `i` is initially 6, `b[i]` refers to `b[6]`, and after executing the line, `i` is incremented by 1 (though not shown in the code snippet, this is implied by the typical behavior of such operations). Therefore, `i` becomes 7, and `preb` now includes the value of `sb + b[6]`.
