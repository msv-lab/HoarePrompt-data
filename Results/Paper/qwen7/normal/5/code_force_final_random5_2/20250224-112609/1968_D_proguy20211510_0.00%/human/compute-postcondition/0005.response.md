Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `n`, `k` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `k`, `pb` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `pb`, `ps` is an integer obtained from converting the original string `ps`**.

In this output state, the variable `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer. The variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are now integers obtained by converting their original string values.
