Postcondition: **`founds` is a boolean indicating whether an element has been found, `foundb` is True indicating that an element matching `maxa` has been found, `i` is 3, `k` is greater than 0, `b` is a list with three elements where the first is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, the second is the original element, and the third is either `maxa` or `a[pb - 1]`. If `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, then `b` includes `a[pb - 1]` as the third element. If `founds` is True, `s` contains `maxa`. Otherwise, if `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `s` contains `a[ps - 1]` and `s` has appended `a[ps - 1]`. Otherwise, `s` is now `a[ps - 1]`, and `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`. The loop or if statement is broken.**
