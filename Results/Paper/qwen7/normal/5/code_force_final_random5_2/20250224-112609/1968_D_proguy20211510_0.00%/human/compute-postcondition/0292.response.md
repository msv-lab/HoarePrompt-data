Based on the initial state provided:

- All elements in `ptsb` are calculated as `preb[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * b[i]` for each `i` in `range(len(pres))`.
- All elements in `ptss` are calculated as `pres[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * s[i]` for each `i` in `range(len(pres))`.
- The value of `maxs` is the maximum value among all elements in `ptss`.
- The value of `maxb` is the maximum value among all elements in `ptsb`.
- Additionally, `maxs` is greater than or equal to `maxb`.

The `print('Draw')` statement simply prints the string 'Draw'. Since no other variables or values are being printed, and the string 'Draw' is explicitly provided, we can directly state what will be printed.

Output: **Draw**
