Postcondition: **All elements in `ptsb` are calculated as `preb[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * b[i]` for each `i` in `range(len(pres))`. All elements in `ptss` are calculated as `pres[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * s[i]` for each `i` in `range(len(pres))`. The value of `maxs` is the maximum value among all elements in `ptss`. The value of `maxb` is the maximum value among all elements in `ptsb`. The current value of `maxs` is greater than the current value of `maxb`.**
