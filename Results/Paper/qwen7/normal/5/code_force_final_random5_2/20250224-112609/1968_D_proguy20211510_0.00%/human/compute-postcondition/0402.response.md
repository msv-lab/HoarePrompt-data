Output State: **`i` is 10; `sb` is `preb[0] + b[6] + b[9] + b[10] + b[i]`; `pres` is a list with the elements `ss + s[7]`, `ss + s[9]`, and `ss + s[10]`; `ss` is `ss + s[9]`; `preb` is a list with the element `preb[0] + b[6] + b[9] + b[10] + b[10]`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains unchanged at 10.
- The value of `sb` remains unchanged as it is defined as `preb[0] + b[6] + b[9] + b[10] + b[i]`.
- The `pres` list appends `ss + s[i]`, which is `ss + s[10]` (since `i` is 10), resulting in `pres` having three elements: `ss + s[7]`, `ss + s[9]`, and `ss + s[10]`.
- The value of `ss` remains unchanged as it is only used in the definition of `sb` and the appended value to `pres`.
- The value of `preb` remains unchanged as it is only used in the definition of `sb`.
