Output State: **`founds` is `False`, `foundb` is `False`**.

Explanation: The code simply assigns `False` to both `founds` and `foundb`. No other variables are affected, so their previous states remain unchanged. The values of `p`, `maxs`, `maxb`, `i`, `rem`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `a`, `maxa`, `b`, and `s` are the same as in the initial state.
