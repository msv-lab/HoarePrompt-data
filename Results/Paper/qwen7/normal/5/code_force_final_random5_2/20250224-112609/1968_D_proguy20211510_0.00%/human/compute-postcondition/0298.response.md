Output State: **`n` is the input integer decremented by 1, `k` is the input integer, `pb` is the input integer, `ps` is the input integer, and `p` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list named `p`. The values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` remain unchanged as they were in the initial state.
