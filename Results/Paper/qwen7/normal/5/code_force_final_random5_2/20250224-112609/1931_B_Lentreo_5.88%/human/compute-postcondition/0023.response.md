Postcondition: `curr` is the sum of \((i - last)\) for each non-zero `i` in `nums`, `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `last` is the last element of the original `nums` list, and `nums` is an empty list after all iterations, and `curr` is not equal to 0.
