Postcondition: `curr` is either `2 * (i - last)` or `3 * (i - last)`, `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `last` is the second-to-last element of the updated `nums`, `i` is the third element of the updated `nums`, `nums` is the list without its first two elements. If `i` is not 0, then `curr` is updated to `3 * (i - last)`. Otherwise, `curr` remains `2 * (i - last)`.
