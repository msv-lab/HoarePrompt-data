Output State: **`curr` is the sum of `(i - last)` for each non-zero `i` in `nums`, `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `last` is the last element of the original `nums` list, and `nums` is an empty list after all iterations.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `curr` will hold the cumulative sum of the differences between each non-zero element `i` in the original `nums` list and the `last` element. The variable `t` remains unchanged within its given bounds, `n` remains the same as the input integer, and `nums` becomes an empty list since all its elements have been processed.
