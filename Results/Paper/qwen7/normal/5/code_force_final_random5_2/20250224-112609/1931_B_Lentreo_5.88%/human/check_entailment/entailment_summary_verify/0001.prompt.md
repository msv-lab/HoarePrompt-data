You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        last = nums[-1]
        curr = 0
        for i in nums:
            if i != 0:
                curr += i - last
        if curr == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer \( t \) (indicating the number of subsequent test cases) and a list of \( n \) non-negative integers whose sum is divisible by \( n \). For each test case, it calculates the sum of the non-zero elements in the list, adjusted by subtracting the last element of the list for each non-zero element. If this adjusted sum equals zero, it prints 'YES', indicating the sum is divisible by \( n \); otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another.
   - The key observation here is that since the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers (`n`), the target amount of water per container would be `total_water / n`.

2. **Given Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the amounts of water in each container.
   - It calculates the difference between the last element and the current element in the list `nums`, accumulating these differences in `curr`.
   - If `curr` is zero, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.

3. **Key Issues in the Given Program:**
   - The logic for determining if it's possible to equalize the water amounts is flawed.
   - The program does not check if the total water can be evenly distributed among all containers.
   - The calculation `curr = 0` does not correctly reflect the necessary condition for equalizing the water amounts.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To solve this problem correctly, we should check if the total water divided by `n` results in an integer. This means the average amount of water per container should be an integer.
   - We can achieve this by checking if the sum of the water amounts is divisible by `n`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        total_water = sum(nums)
        if total_water % n == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the water can be equally distributed. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
