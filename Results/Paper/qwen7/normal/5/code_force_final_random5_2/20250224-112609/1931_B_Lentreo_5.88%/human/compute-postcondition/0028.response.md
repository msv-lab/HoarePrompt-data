Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `curr` is the sum of \((i - last)\) for each non-zero `i` in `nums`, `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4 - 1\), `last` is the last element of the original `nums` list, and `nums` is an empty list after all iterations.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This operation does not affect the values of `curr`, `t`, `last`, or the state of the `nums` list. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
