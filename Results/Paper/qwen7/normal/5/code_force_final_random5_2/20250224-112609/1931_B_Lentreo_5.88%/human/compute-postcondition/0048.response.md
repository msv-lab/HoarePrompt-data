Based on the initial state provided:

- `curr` will be the sum of all elements in `nums` except those that are 0, with each element adjusted by subtracting `last` from it, where `last` is the value of `curr` from the previous iteration.
- `curr` is not equal to 0.

Given this information, the value of `curr` is determined by the formula described, but since the actual `nums` list and the value of `last` from the previous iteration are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `curr`.

However, the print statement does not reference `curr` or any other variable; instead, it simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
