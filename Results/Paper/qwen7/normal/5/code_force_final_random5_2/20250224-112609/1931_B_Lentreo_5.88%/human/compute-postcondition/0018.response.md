Postcondition: `curr` is `3 * (i - last)`, `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `last` is the second-to-last element of the updated `nums`, `i` is the third element of the updated `nums`, `nums` is the list without its first two elements, and this holds true if `i` is not equal to 0.
