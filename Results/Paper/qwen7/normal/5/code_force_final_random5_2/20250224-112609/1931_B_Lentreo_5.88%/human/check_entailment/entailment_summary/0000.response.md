Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by checking if the sum of the differences between each element and the last element in the list is zero. However, this approach is flawed. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation**: The program calculates `curr` as the sum of `(i - last)` for each non-zero `i`. This calculation does not reflect the total water redistribution needed to equalize the containers. Instead, it simply checks if the sum of the non-zero elements differs from the last element.

2. **Divisibility Check**: The problem requires making the amount of water in all containers the same, which means each container should end up with the average amount of water, i.e., `total_water / n`. The program does not actually perform any operations to achieve this equal distribution; it only checks a condition that is not relevant to the solution.

3. **Guaranteed Divisibility**: The problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`, so theoretically, it is always possible to distribute the water evenly among the containers. The program should directly conclude 'YES' for every test case without needing to perform any complex calculations.

Given these points, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
