Based on the initial state provided:

- `curr` is updated to the sum of all non-zero elements starting from the second element of `nums`.
- `n` remains an input integer.
- `t` is `t - len(nums)`.
- `last` is the last element of the original `nums`.
- `curr` is not equal to 0.

The `print('NO')` statement simply prints the string 'NO'. The values of `curr`, `n`, `t`, and `last` are not relevant to the output of this specific print statement.

Output: **NO**
