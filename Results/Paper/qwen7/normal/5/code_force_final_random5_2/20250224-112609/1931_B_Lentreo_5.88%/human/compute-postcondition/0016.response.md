Output State: **`curr` is `3 * (i - last)`, `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `last` is the second-to-last element of the updated `nums`, `i` is the third element of the updated `nums`, `nums` is the list without its first two elements.**

Explanation: The variable `curr` is updated by adding the difference between `i` and `last` to its current value. Since `curr` was initially `2 * (i - last)`, after executing `curr += i - last`, the new value of `curr` becomes `3 * (i - last)`. The values of `t`, `n`, `last`, `i`, and `nums` remain unchanged from their initial states.
