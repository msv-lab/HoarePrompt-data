Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another, where the source container index must be less than the destination container index.
2. The provided solution iterates through each test case, but the logic implemented does not correctly solve the problem. Specifically, the logic calculates the sum of differences between each element and the last element in the list, which does not reflect the actual operations allowed in the problem statement.
3. To solve the problem correctly, we need to check if the sum of water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers. If it is, it means the average amount of water per container can be achieved by evenly distributing the total water among all containers.
4. The provided code does not perform this check. Instead, it calculates an incorrect value (`curr`) which is not relevant to solving the problem.

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
