State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `t` in the range function.
2. For the loop to execute, the range function needs to have a valid value for `t`.
3. The problem statement specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
4. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `t` must satisfy this condition.

Thus, the state before the loop should be adjusted to ensure `t` is within the specified range.
