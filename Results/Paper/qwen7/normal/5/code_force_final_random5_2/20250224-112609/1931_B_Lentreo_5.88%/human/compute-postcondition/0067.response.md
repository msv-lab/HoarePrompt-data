Output State: **`curr` is updated to its previous value plus the first element of `nums` minus `last`, `n` is an input integer, `t` is `t - 1`, `nums` is a list of integers starting from the second element, and the first element of `nums` (`i`) is not 0.**

Explanation: The code updates `curr` by adding the first element of `nums` (which is `i`) to `curr` and then subtracting `last`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the operation. The value of `t` is decremented by 1. The list `nums` is modified such that it now starts from the second element onwards, and the condition that the first element of `nums` is not 0 is still valid.
