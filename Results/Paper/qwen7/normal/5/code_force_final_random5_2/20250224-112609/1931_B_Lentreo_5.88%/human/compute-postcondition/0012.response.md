Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `nums`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `nums` to iterate over.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `curr` is `i - last`
   - `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\)
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string that must have at least 1 element
   - `last` is the last element of the list `nums`
   - `i` is the first element of `nums`
   - The current value of `i` is not 0

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each element in `nums`, the variable `i` will be set to the next element in the list `nums`.
   - The list `nums` will lose its first element after the current iteration.

5. **New State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - `curr` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `last` remains the same as it was not modified in the loop body.
   - `i` will be the second element of the updated `nums` list (if `nums` still has elements).
   - `nums` will be the list without its first element.

Given these points, the new state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `curr` is `i - last`
- `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\)
- `n` is an input integer
- `last` is the last element of the list `nums`
- `i` is the second element of the list `nums` (if `nums` still has elements)
- `nums` is the list without its first element

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`curr` is `i - last`, `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `last` is the last element of the list `nums`, `i` is the second element of the list `nums` (if `nums` still has elements), `nums` is the list without its first element**.
