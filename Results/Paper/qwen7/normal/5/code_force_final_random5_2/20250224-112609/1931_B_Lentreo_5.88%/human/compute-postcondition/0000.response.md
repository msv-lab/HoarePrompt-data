Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `t` is an input integer.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) remains valid, and now `t` also holds the specific value input by the user. All other preconditions and conditions about the variables `n` and the list of integers remain unchanged for now.
