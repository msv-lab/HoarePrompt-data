Based on the initial state provided:

- `curr` is the sum of \((i - last)\) for each non-zero `i` in `nums`.
- `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `last` is the last element of the original `nums` list.
- `nums` is an empty list after all iterations.
- `curr` is not equal to 0.

The print statement is `print('NO')`.

Given that the `nums` list is empty after all iterations, there are no non-zero elements in `nums` to contribute to the calculation of `curr`. Therefore, `curr` should be 0, but it is explicitly stated that `curr` is not equal to 0. This implies that `curr` must have been set to a non-zero value through some other means not described in the initial state.

However, the print statement itself does not depend on the value of `curr`. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
