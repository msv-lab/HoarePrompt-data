Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop iterates over `val_b` which is an element from `main_ar`. Therefore, the relevant variables in the loop head are `val_b`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `main_ar` to iterate over.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `sub_summ` is the sum of all elements in `sec_arr`.
   - `main_ar` is a list containing sublists.
   - `sec_arr` must have at least as many elements as there are sublists in `main_ar`.
   - `val_b` is the first element of each sublist in `main_ar`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - After the previous iteration, `val_b` was the first element of one of the sublists in `main_ar`.
   - For the next iteration, `val_b` will be the first element of the next sublist in `main_ar`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `sub_summ` remains unchanged because the loop body does not update `sub_summ` unless the sum of `val_b[0]` and `val_b[1]` is non-negative.
   - `main_ar` loses one element (the sublist that was just processed).
   - `sec_arr` remains unchanged.
   - `val_b` changes to the first element of the next sublist in `main_ar`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`sub_summ` is the sum of all elements in `sec_arr`, `main_ar` is a list containing sublists with one less element, `sec_arr` must have at least as many elements as there are sublists in `main_ar`, and `val_b` is the first element of the next sublist in `main_ar`**.
