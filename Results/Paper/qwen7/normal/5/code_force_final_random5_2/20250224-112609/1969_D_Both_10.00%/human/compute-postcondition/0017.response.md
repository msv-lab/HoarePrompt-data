Output State: **`sub_summ' is now the original sub_summ plus the sum of val_b[0] and val_b[1], `main_ar` is a list containing sublists with one less element, `sec_arr` must have at least as many elements as there are sublists in `main_ar`, and `val_b` is the first element of the next sublist in `main_ar`.**

This means that the value of `sub_summ` has been updated to include the sum of the first two elements of `val_b`. All other conditions and relationships between the variables remain unchanged.
