Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses `func_1` and `func_2` for input handling.
   - `func_1` returns an integer value from the input.
   - `func_2` returns a tuple of integers from the input.
   - These functions are not defined in the provided code snippet, but they are assumed to work correctly for reading input values.

2. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It then reads two lists of integers `a` and `b`.

3. **Profit Calculation**:
   - The program defines `func_3` to calculate Alice's profit.
   - `func_3` takes two arguments: `main_ar` and `sec_arr`.
   - `main_ar` is expected to be the list of prices for Alice (`a`).
   - `sec_arr` is expected to be the list of prices for Bob (`b`).
   - The function calculates the sum of `val_a[0]` for all `val_a` in `sec_arr`, which is the total price Bob would pay if he bought all items from Alice.
   - It then iterates over `main_ar` and adds `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` to `sub_summ` if `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`. This part seems incorrect because `val_b` is just an element from `b`, not a tuple with two elements.

4. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The problem requires Alice to maximize her profit and Bob to minimize it.
   - The optimal strategy involves selecting the best items for Alice to buy such that the difference between Bob's payment and Alice's cost is maximized.
   - The given function does not implement this logic correctly.

### Correctness Check

Given the analysis, the provided function `func_3` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, it does not account for the optimal selection of items based on the given constraints and does not handle the scenario where Bob can take up to `k` items for free.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the provided program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
