Output State: **`sub_summ' is now the original value of `sub_summ` plus the value of `val_b[0] + val_b[1]`, `main_ar` is a list containing sublists, and `sec_arr` must have at least as many elements as there are sublists in `main_ar`, `val_b` is the first element of each sublist in `main_ar`, and the current value of `val_b[0]` plus `val_b[1]` is greater than or equal to 0.**

This means that the `sub_summ` variable has been updated by adding the sum of the first two elements of each sublist (`val_b[0] + val_b[1]`) to its original value. All other conditions and relationships between variables remain unchanged.
