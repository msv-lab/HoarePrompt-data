Postcondition: `sub_summ` is the sum of all elements in `sec_arr`, `main_ar` is a list containing sublists, and `sec_arr` must have at least as many elements as there are sublists in `main_ar`, `val_b` is the first element of each sublist in `main_ar`. If the sum of `val_b[0]` and `val_b[1]` is greater than or equal to 0, then `sub_summ` is updated to include the value of `val_b[0] + val_b[1]`. If the sum of `val_b[0]` and `val_b[1]` is less than 0, `sub_summ` remains unchanged.
