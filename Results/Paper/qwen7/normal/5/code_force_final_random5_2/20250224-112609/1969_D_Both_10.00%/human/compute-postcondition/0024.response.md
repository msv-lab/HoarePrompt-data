Output State: **`sub_summ` is the sum of `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` for all sublists in `main_ar` where `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Natural Language Description: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `sub_summ` contains the sum of the values obtained by adding the first and second elements (`val_b[0]` and `val_b[1]`) of each sublist in `main_ar`, but only if their sum is greater than or equal to zero. If the sum of `val_b[0]` and `val_b[1]` is less than zero for any sublist, those values are not included in `sub_summ`.
