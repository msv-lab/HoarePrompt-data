Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for val_b in main_ar:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `val_b` and `main_ar`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `main_ar`. After each iteration, `val_b` takes the value of the next sublist in `main_ar`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `sub_summ` is the sum of all elements in `sec_arr`.
   - `main_ar` is a list containing sublists with one less element.
   - `sec_arr` must have at least as many elements as there are sublists in `main_ar`.
   - `val_b` is the first element of the next sublist in `main_ar`.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `main_ar`, `val_b` will be set to the next sublist in `main_ar`.
   - For the loop to continue, `main_ar` must still contain at least one sublist.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `sub_summ` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the loop head.
   - `main_ar` should now point to the remaining sublists in the list (one less than before).
   - `val_b` should be the first element of the next sublist in `main_ar`.

Given these points, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

- `sub_summ` remains the same.
- `main_ar` now contains one less sublist.
- `val_b` is the first element of the next sublist in `main_ar`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`sub_summ` is the sum of all elements in `sec_arr`, `main_ar` is a list containing sublists with one less element, `sec_arr` must have at least as many elements as there are sublists in `main_ar`, and `val_b` is the first element of the next sublist in `main_ar`**.
