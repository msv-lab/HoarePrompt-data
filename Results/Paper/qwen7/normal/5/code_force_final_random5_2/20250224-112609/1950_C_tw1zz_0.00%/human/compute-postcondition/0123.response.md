Output State: **`h1` is '09', `m1` is equal to the string `m`, `time` is an empty string, and the value of `h` is '21'.**

The code assigns the string `'09'` to the variable `h1`. This changes the value of `h1` from an empty string to `'09'`. The values of `m1`, `time`, and `h` remain unchanged from their initial states.
