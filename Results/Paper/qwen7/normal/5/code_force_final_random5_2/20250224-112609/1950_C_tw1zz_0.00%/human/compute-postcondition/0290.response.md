Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `range(int(input()))`. This means the loop variable `_` is being incremented by the `range` function, and the loop will run for as many times as the integer value entered by the user.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `h1` is either '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '01' to '15'
   - `m1` is `m`
   - `time` is either 'AM', 'PM', or an empty string
   - `h` is an input string split from the first part of the input
   - `m` is an input string split from the second part of the input
   - The number of remaining iterations is `num_iterations - 1`

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by the integer value entered by the user, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the number of remaining iterations. After one iteration, the number of remaining iterations should decrease by 1.
   - All other variables (`h1`, `m1`, `time`, `h`, `m`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

4. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The number of remaining iterations is currently `num_iterations - 1`. After one iteration, it will be `num_iterations - 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`h1` is either '01', '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '01' to '15', `m1` is `m`, `time` is either 'AM', 'PM', or an empty string, `h` is an input string split from the first part of the input, `m` is an input string split from the second part of the input, and the number of remaining iterations is `num_iterations - 2`**
