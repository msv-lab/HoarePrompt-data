Postcondition: `h1` is either '11' or a two-digit number between '01' and '15', `m1` is `m`, `time` is either 'AM', 'PM', or an empty string, `h` is an input string split from the first part of the input, `m` is an input string split from the second part of the input, and the number of remaining iterations is `num_iterations - 1`.
