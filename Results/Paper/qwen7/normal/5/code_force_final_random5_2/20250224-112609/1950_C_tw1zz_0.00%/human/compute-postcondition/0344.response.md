Postcondition: `h1` is either '11' or '12' (or remains the same as `h` if `h` is not '23'), `m1` is `m`, `time` is 'PM', `h` is an input string split from the first part of the input, `m` is an input string split from the second part of the input, and the number of remaining iterations is `num_iterations - 2`.
