Output State: **`h1` is '12', `m1` is `m`, `time` is 'AM', `h` is an input string split from the first part of the input, `m` is an input string split from the second part of the input, and the number of remaining iterations is `num_iterations - 2`.**

Explanation: The line `time = 'AM'` assigns the string `'AM'` to the variable `time`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
