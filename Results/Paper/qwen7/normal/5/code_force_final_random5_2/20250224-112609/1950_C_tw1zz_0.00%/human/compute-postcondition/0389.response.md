Functionality: **The function processes multiple time inputs in the 24-hour format and converts them to the 12-hour format with AM/PM designation. It reads an integer `t` indicating the number of time inputs, followed by `t` lines of time strings in the format "hh:mm". For each input, it converts the hour part from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and determines whether the time is in the morning (AM) or afternoon (PM). Finally, it prints the converted time for each input.**
