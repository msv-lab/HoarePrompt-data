Output State: **`h1` is '05', `m1` is equal to the string `m`, `time` is 'PM', the value of `h` is '17'**.

The code simply assigns the string `'PM'` to the variable `time`. This does not affect the values of `h1`, `m1`, or `h`. Therefore, these variables retain their original values from the initial state.
