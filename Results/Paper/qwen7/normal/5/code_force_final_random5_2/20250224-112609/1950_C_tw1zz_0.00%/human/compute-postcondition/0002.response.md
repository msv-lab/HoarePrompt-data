Output State: **`h1` is an empty string, `m1` is equal to the string `m`.**

Explanation: The code assigns an empty string to `h1` and assigns the value of `m` to `m1`. The initial state of `h` and `m` being split from the input is preserved, just with different variable names now holding parts of the original input.
