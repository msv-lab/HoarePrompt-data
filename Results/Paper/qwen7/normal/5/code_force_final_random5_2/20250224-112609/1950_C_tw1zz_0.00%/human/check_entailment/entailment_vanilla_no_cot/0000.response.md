Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program can be optimized and simplified significantly. The current implementation uses a large number of conditional statements to convert the 24-hour format to the 12-hour format, which is inefficient and error-prone. A more efficient way would be to use arithmetic operations to determine whether it's AM or PM and adjust the hour accordingly. Hereâ€™s a corrected version:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (h, m) = map(str, input().split(':'))
        h1 = int(h) % 12
        time = 'AM' if int(h) < 12 else 'PM'
        if h1 == 0:
            h1 = 12
        print(f'{h1}:{m} {time}')


func()
```

This version correctly handles the conversion from 24-hour to 12-hour format and ensures that the output is formatted as required.
