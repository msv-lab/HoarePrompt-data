Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers in strictly increasing order (0 ≤ a[i] ≤ 10^9), `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `d1` is a defaultdict with default factory int, `d2` is a defaultdict with default factory int.**

Explanation: The code initializes `d2` as a defaultdict with an integer default factory. This means `d2` is now a dictionary-like object where any key that does not exist will default to an integer value (0). The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, `m`, and `d1` remain unchanged from their initial states.
