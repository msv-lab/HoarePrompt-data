Postcondition: `start` is 0, `end` must be greater than 0, `mini` is the minimum value between `abs(lst[0] - lst[1])` and `11111111`, and either `start + 1` is less than the length of `lst` or the original condition does not hold, thus `mini` remains unchanged, and the current value of `start` is 1 if `start - 1` is greater than -1.
