You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    return sum((v // 3 for v in freq.values()))



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list of integers representing the lengths of sticks. It calculates the frequency of each unique stick length in the list and then returns the sum of these frequencies divided by 3.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the lengths of the sticks.
   
2. **Function Call**:
   - The program calls `func_1(arr)` for each test case, where `arr` is the list of stick lengths.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list of stick lengths `arr` as input.
   - It uses a dictionary `freq` to count the frequency of each stick length.
   - It then calculates the sum of the integer division of each frequency by 3 (`v // 3`), which represents the maximum number of triangles (since a triangle has 3 sides) that can be formed from each group of sticks of the same length.
   - Finally, it returns this sum.

### Checking the Logic

- **Problem Requirement**: We need to find the maximum number of regular polygons (with equal sides) that can be constructed using the given sticks without breaking any sticks.
- **Current Implementation**: The function `func_1` correctly counts the frequency of each stick length and calculates how many triangles (the simplest polygon) can be formed from each group of sticks. However, this logic does not account for forming other types of polygons (e.g., squares, pentagons).

### Example Analysis

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `4 2 2 3 3 3 3`
   - Output: `1`
   - Explanation: The longest common length is 3, and there are 4 sticks of length 3. Since a triangle requires 3 sticks, the maximum number of triangles (and thus the maximum number of regular polygons) is `4 // 3 = 1`.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `9 4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4`
   - Output: `2`
   - Explanation: There are 4 sticks of length 4 and 5 sticks of length 2. The maximum number of triangles that can be formed from the 4 sticks of length 4 is `4 // 3 = 1`, and from the 5 sticks of length 2, it is `5 // 3 = 1`. Therefore, the total is `1 + 1 = 2`.

### Conclusion

The current implementation correctly calculates the maximum number of triangles that can be formed from each group of sticks. However, the problem requires forming regular polygons of any type (not just triangles). To correctly solve this problem, the function should consider forming polygons with more than 3 sides. Specifically, it should check the minimum frequency among all possible polygon sides (3, 4, 5, etc.) and return the minimum result.

### Final Answer

Given the analysis, the current implementation does not fully meet the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is **incorrect**.

Correctness: **False**
