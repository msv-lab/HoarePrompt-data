Output State: **`i` is 3, `x` is an input integer from the third split value, `y` is an input integer from the third split value, `coord` is a list containing four tuples: ((1, `y`), (`x`, `y`), (2, `y`), (3, `y`)), `p2` is (3 - 2)² + (y - y)²**.

Explanation: The code calculates `p2` as `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])**2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1])**2`. Given the structure of `coord`, `coord[3][0]` is 3 and `coord[2][0]` is 2, so `3 - 2` equals 1. Similarly, `coord[3][1]` is `y` and `coord[2][1]` is also `y`, so `y - y` equals 0. Therefore, `p2` is calculated as `1**2 + 0**2`, which simplifies to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
