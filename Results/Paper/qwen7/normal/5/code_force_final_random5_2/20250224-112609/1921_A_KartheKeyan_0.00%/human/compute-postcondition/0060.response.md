Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `coord` is a list containing three tuples, each representing a point with coordinates `(x, y)`. So, `coord` looks like this: `[ (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3) ]`.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `p1` is the squared distance between the second and the first points in `coord`. The formula for the squared distance between two points \((x1, y1)\) and \((x2, y2)\) is \((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2\).
   - `p2` is the squared distance between the fourth and the third points in `coord`. Since there are only three points, the fourth point does not exist in the list. Therefore, `p2` will be calculated as the squared distance between the third and the second points, i.e., \((x3 - x2)^2 + (y3 - y2)^2\).
   - `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(res)
   ```

Given the above breakdown, let's determine what `res` will be:

- The squared distance `p1` between the first and second points is:
  \[
  p1 = (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2
  \]

- The squared distance `p2` between the second and third points is:
  \[
  p2 = (x3 - x2)^2 + (y3 - y2)^2
  \]

- `res` is then:
  \[
  res = \left| \sqrt{p1} \times \sqrt{p2} \right| = \sqrt{p1 \times p2}
  \]

Since the exact values of `x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3` are not provided, we cannot compute a specific numerical value for `res`. However, we know the form of the expression.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **sqrt(((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2) * ((x3 - x2)**2 + (y3 - y2)**2))**
