Output State: **`coord` is a list containing three tuples: the first tuple is (x, y), the second tuple is (x, y), and the third tuple is (x, y); `i` is 3; `p1` is the squared distance between the second and the first points in `coord`; `p2` is the squared distance between the fourth and the third points in `coord`; `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `res` as the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`. Since `p1` and `p2` are defined as the squared distances between specific points in `coord`, their values remain unchanged. The new variable `res` is assigned the calculated value, which is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`. All other variables retain their initial states.
