Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(4)`. This means `i` is the variable that controls the loop.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 1
   - `x` is an input integer from the second split value
   - `y` is an input integer from the second split value
   - `coord` is a list containing two tuples: (1, y), (x, y)

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than 4. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented and should still be less than 4.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since `i` starts from 1 and the loop will increment `i` by 1 each time it runs, the new value of `i` will be 2. The values of `x`, `y`, and `coord` do not change within the loop head and are not affected by the loop condition.

5. **Formulate the new state**: Based on the above reasoning, the new state at the start of the next iteration will be:
   - `i` is 2
   - `x` remains the same (an input integer from the second split value)
   - `y` remains the same (an input integer from the second split value)
   - `coord` remains the same (a list containing two tuples: (1, y), (x, y))

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer from the second split value, `y` is an input integer from the second split value, `coord` is a list containing two tuples: (1, y), (x, y)**
