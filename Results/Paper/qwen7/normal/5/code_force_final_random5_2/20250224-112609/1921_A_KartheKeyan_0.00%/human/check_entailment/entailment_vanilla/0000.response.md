### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Preparation:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and iterates over each test case.
   - It then reads the coordinates of the four corners of the square and stores them in a list called `coord`.

2. **Sorting Coordinates:**
   - The coordinates are sorted, but this step is unnecessary because the problem guarantees that the input will always form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. Therefore, sorting is not required.

3. **Calculating Distances:**
   - The program calculates the squared distances between pairs of points. Specifically, it calculates the squared distance between the first and second points (`p1`) and the third and fourth points (`p2`).
   - This approach assumes that the points are ordered such that the first and second points form one side of the square, and the third and fourth points form the opposite side. However, without proper ordering, this assumption may be incorrect.

4. **Area Calculation:**
   - The program then calculates the area of the square using the formula `abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))`.
   - Since `p1` and `p2` are squared distances, taking the square root twice results in the original distance. Multiplying these distances gives the product of the lengths of the sides, which should be the same for a square.

5. **Handling Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by decrementing `n` after processing each test case.

### Analysis:

- The main issue lies in the assumption that the first and second points and the third and fourth points form the sides of the square. This assumption is not always valid without proper ordering.
- A more robust approach would be to calculate all pairwise distances and identify the maximum and minimum distances, which would correspond to the diagonal and side length of the square, respectively.

### Conclusion:

Given the problem constraints and the current implementation, the program might not handle all possible orders of the input points correctly. However, since the problem guarantees that the points will always form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the current implementation should work correctly for the given constraints.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
