Output State: **`coord` is a list containing two tuples: the first tuple is (x, y) from the input, and the second tuple is also (x, y); `i` is 0; `x` is an integer from the input split; `y` is an integer from the input split.**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(x, y)` to the list `coord`. Since `coord` initially contains one tuple `(x, y)`, after appending, it now contains two tuples: the original `(x, y)` and the new `(x, y)`. The values of `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
