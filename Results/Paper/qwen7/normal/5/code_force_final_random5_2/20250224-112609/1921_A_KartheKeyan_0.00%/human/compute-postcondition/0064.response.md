Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) indicating the number of test cases, followed by t sets of coordinates (x_i, y_i) for the corners of squares. The function returns whether the given points form a valid square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area for each test case.**

Note: The function does not return a single value but processes multiple test cases, validating the formation of squares based on the given coordinates.
