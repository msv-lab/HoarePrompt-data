Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element, `num` is the first element of `arr`, and `frequency_table` is a dictionary with the key `num` and its value set to 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the `frequency_table` dictionary by incrementing the count of the `num` (which is the first element of `arr`) by 1. Since `frequency_table` was initially empty, the value of `num` is added as a key with a value of 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
