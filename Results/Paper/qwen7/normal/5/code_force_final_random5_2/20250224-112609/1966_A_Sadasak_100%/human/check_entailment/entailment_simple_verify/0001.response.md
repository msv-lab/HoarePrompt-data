### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program:

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` attempts to limit the frequency of each card to `k` if it exceeds `k`, which is not required by the problem. The goal is to minimize the number of cards, not to limit the frequency to `k`.

2. **Flawed Determination of Minimum Cards:**
   - The program checks if `k` is present in the frequency table and prints `k - 1` if true. Otherwise, it prints `n`. This logic is incorrect because it does not account for the actual number of cards that can be reduced through the operations.

Given the corrected approach outlined in the original assessment, let's verify the revised program:

### Revised Program:
```python
from collections import defaultdict

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Count the frequency of each card number
    freq = defaultdict(int)
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] += 1

    min_cards = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        min_cards += (count // k) * (k - 1) + (count % k)

    print(min_cards)
```

### Analysis of the Revised Program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the frequency of each card number.

3. **Determining Minimum Cards:**
   - For each group of cards (i.e., each unique card number), the program calculates how many full sets of `k` cards can be formed.
   - It then calculates the remaining cards after forming these sets using the formula `(count // k) * (k - 1) + (count % k)`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program sums up the remaining cards for all groups and prints the total.

### Correctness of the Revised Program:
- The revised program correctly implements the logic to minimize the number of cards by forming as many full sets of `k` cards as possible and accounting for the remaining cards.
- The logic ensures that the number of cards is minimized according to the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in the `func_1` function and the incorrect approach to determining the minimum number of cards. The revised program provided in the original assessment is correct.

Final: **True**

The given program is incorrect, and the revised program is correct.
