Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, and `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary named `frequency_table`. This does not affect the values of `arr` or `k`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and only `frequency_table` is updated to be an empty dictionary.
