You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        freq = func_1(nums, k)
        if k in freq.values():
            print(k - 1)
        else:
            print(n)

def func_1(arr, k):
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
        if frequency_table[num] > k:
            frequency_table[num] = k
    return frequency_table



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `k`. It returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is an integer from `arr` that appears more than `k` times, and its value is set to `k`. Integers that do not appear more than `k` times are not included in the `frequency_table`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Handling Edge Case:**
   - If `k > n`, the program prints `n`. This is correct because if `k` is greater than the number of cards, no exchanges can be made, so the number of cards remains unchanged.

3. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each card number.
   - However, the logic inside `func_1` is incorrect. It attempts to limit the frequency of each card to `k` if it exceeds `k`, but this does not align with the problem statement. The goal is to minimize the number of cards, not to limit the frequency to `k`.

4. **Determining Minimum Cards:**
   - After calculating the frequencies, the program checks if `k` is present in the frequency table.
   - If `k` is in the frequency table, it prints `k - 1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `n`.

### Issues Identified:
- The function `func_1` incorrectly limits the frequency of each card to `k` if it exceeds `k`, which is not required by the problem.
- The logic for determining the minimum number of cards is flawed. The program should consider how many groups of `k` cards can be formed and then calculate the remaining cards accordingly.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly:
1. Group the cards by their numbers.
2. For each group, determine how many full sets of `k` cards can be formed.
3. Calculate the remaining cards after forming these sets.

### Revised Program:
```python
from collections import defaultdict

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Count the frequency of each card number
    freq = defaultdict(int)
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] += 1

    min_cards = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        min_cards += (count // k) * (k - 1) + (count % k)

    print(min_cards)
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in the `func_1` function and the incorrect approach to determining the minimum number of cards. Therefore, the given program is **incorrect**.

Correctness: **False**
