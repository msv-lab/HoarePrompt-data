Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `k`. It returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is an integer from `arr` that appears more than `k` times, and its value is set to `k`. Integers that do not appear more than `k` times are not included in the `frequency_table`.**
