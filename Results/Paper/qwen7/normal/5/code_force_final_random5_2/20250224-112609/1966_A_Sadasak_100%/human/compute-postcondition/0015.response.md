Output State: The `arr` list is now empty, `num` has iterated through every element in `arr`, and `frequency_table` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the original `arr` list and its value is capped at `k`. Specifically, for any integer `num` in the original `arr`, if the count of `num` in `arr` was greater than `k`, then the value in `frequency_table` for that `num` is exactly `k`. If the count was less than or equal to `k`, then the value in `frequency_table` for that `num` is the exact count of `num` in `arr`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the `frequency_table` will contain the counts of each unique number in `arr`, but these counts will never exceed `k`.
