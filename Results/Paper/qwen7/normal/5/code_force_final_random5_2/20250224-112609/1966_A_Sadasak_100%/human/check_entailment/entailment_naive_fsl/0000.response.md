Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the `func_1` function is not designed to handle the requirements of the problem statement. The function aims to limit the frequency of each number to `k`, but it does not account for the actual number of groups of `k` cards that can be formed and replaced. This leads to incorrect results in several scenarios.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5 3
4 1 1 4 4
```
The expected output should be `2`, as we can form two groups of three cards with the number `4` and replace them with two cards. However, the program will incorrectly output `3` because it simply checks if `k` is present in the frequency table and prints `k-1` if true, which is not the correct approach.

Another example is:
```
7 2
4 2 1 100 5 2 3
```
The expected output should be `1`, as we can form three groups of two cards with the number `2` and replace them with two cards, leaving only one card with the number `1`. However, the program will incorrectly output `1` because it does not properly handle the logic of forming groups and replacing them.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem for all potential cases.
