Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `arr` is an empty list, `num` is not defined (since the loop has finished), and `frequency_table` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the original `arr` that appeared more than `k` times, and its value is set to `k`.

This means that every number in the original list `arr` that appeared more than `k` times will have its count capped at `k` in the `frequency_table`. All other numbers that did not appear more than `k` times will not be present in the `frequency_table`.
