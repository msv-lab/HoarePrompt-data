Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Use of `func_1` Function**: 
   - The function `func_1` is designed to limit the frequency of each number to `k`, but this does not help in determining the minimum number of cards remaining.
   - Instead, we need to determine how many groups of `k` identical cards we can form and then calculate the remaining cards based on those groups.

2. **Logic for Calculating Minimum Cards Remaining**:
   - We should count how many complete groups of `k` cards we can form from each number.
   - The remaining cards will be the total number of cards minus the number of cards used in these complete groups.
   - If the remaining cards are less than `k`, they cannot form another group, so we simply return the remaining cards.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count the frequency of each number
    freq = {}
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    # Calculate the minimum number of cards remaining
    min_cards_remaining = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        min_cards_remaining += (count // k) * (k - 1)
        min_cards_remaining += count % k
    
    print(min_cards_remaining)
```

This corrected program correctly calculates the minimum number of cards remaining by forming as many groups of `k` cards as possible and then accounting for the remaining cards.
