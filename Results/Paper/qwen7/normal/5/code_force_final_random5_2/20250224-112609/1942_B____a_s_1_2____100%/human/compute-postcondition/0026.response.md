Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` must be greater than 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `i` is `t - 1`.
   - `mex` is the minimum value between `n` and `p[i]`.
   - `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`.
   - `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `p` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` except for `p[i]` which is `mex - a[i]`.

2. **Loop Head**: 
   - The loop iterates over `i` in the range from `n - 1` to `0` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - The loop variable `i` is being decremented by 1 each iteration.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range `[0, n-1]`.

4. **Current Values at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is currently `t - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than or equal to `0`.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - In the next iteration, `i` will be `i - 1`, so it will be `(t - 1) - 1 = t - 2`.
   - To ensure the loop continues, `t - 2` must be greater than or equal to `0`, which means `t` must be at least `2`.

6. **Other Variables**:
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `mex`, `a`, and `p` are not directly affected by the loop itself but may change inside the loop body.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `t` must be at least `2`.
- `i` will be `t - 2`.
- `n` remains the same.
- `mex`, `a`, and `p` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

So, the updated state is:

**State: **`t` must be at least 2, `i` is `t - 2`, `n` is the same, `mex` is the minimum value between `n` and `p[i]`, `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` except for `p[i]` which is `mex - a[i]`**.
