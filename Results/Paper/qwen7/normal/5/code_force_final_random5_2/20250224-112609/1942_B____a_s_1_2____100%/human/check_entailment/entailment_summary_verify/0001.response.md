### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the provided program and function summary to ensure the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case individually.
   - It reads the length \( n \) and the array \( a \) for each test case.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The list `p` is initialized with `-1` for all indices, which is a reasonable placeholder.
   - `mex` is initialized to \( n \), which is a good starting point for finding the minimum excluded value.

3. **Constructing the Permutation:**
   - The loop iterates from \( n-1 \) to \( 0 \). For each index \( i \):
     - It sets \( p[i] \) to \( \text{mex} - a[i] \).
     - It updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and the newly assigned value of \( p[i] \).

4. **Output:**
   - The constructed permutation \( p \) is printed for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Approach:**
  - The goal is to ensure that \( a_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).
  - By setting \( p[i] = \text{mex} - a[i] \), the program ensures that the MEX condition is satisfied.
  - The use of `mex` to keep track of the smallest unused value in the permutation is crucial.

- **Handling of `mex`:**
  - The `mex` value is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the newly assigned value of \( p[i] \). This ensures that the smallest unused value is correctly tracked.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles all edge cases as specified in the problem statement. It guarantees that at least one valid permutation exists and respects the constraints.

However, upon closer inspection, we notice that the program might not always produce a valid permutation. Specifically, the logic for updating `mex` and assigning values to `p` might not always ensure that the permutation is valid. Here's why:

- **Potential Issue:**
  - The value of `p[i]` is determined by `mex - a[i]`. If `mex - a[i]` is already used in the permutation, it will overwrite an existing value, potentially leading to invalid permutations.

### Example Counterexample:

Consider the following input:
```
1
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

- For \( i = 4 \):
  - `a[4] = 2`
  - `mex = 5` initially
  - `p[4] = mex - a[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`
  - `mex = min(mex, p[4]) = min(5, 3) = 3`

- For \( i = 3 \):
  - `a[3] = 1`
  - `mex = 3` (since 3 is the smallest unused value)
  - `p[3] = mex - a[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`
  - `mex = min(mex, p[3]) = min(3, 2) = 2`

- For \( i = 2 \):
  - `a[2] = -2`
  - `mex = 2` (since 2 is the smallest unused value)
  - `p[2] = mex - a[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`
  - `mex = min(mex, p[2]) = min(2, 4) = 2` (this is incorrect because 2 is already used)

This leads to an invalid permutation since `p[2]` should be 4 but `mex` is incorrectly updated to 2.

### Conclusion:

The program does not guarantee the construction of a valid permutation in all cases due to the potential issue with the `mex` update logic. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
