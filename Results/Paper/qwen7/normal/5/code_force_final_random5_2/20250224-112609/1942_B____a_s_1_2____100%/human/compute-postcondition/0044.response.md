Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `mex` is updated to the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`, `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `p[i]` to `mex - a[i]`. Since `i` is `n-2`, `mex` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `p[i]` (which is now `mex - a[i]`), and `p[i]` is set to `mex - a[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
