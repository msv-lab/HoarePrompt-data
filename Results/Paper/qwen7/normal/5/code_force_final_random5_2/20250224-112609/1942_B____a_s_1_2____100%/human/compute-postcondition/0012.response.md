Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `t` must be greater than 0
- `n` must be at least 1
- `i` is `n - 2`
- `mex` is updated to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`
- `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop starts from `n - 1` and decrements `i` until it reaches `-1`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `n - 2`.

### Next Iteration
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decremented by 1 from `n - 2` to `n - 3`.
- Therefore, `i` will be `n - 3` at the start of the next iteration.

### Adjusting the States
- `t` remains unchanged because it is not involved in the loop head.
- `n` remains unchanged because it is not involved in the loop head.
- `i` is now `n - 3`.
- `mex` and `p[i]` will be updated based on the new value of `i` (which is `n - 3`), but since we are only asked to adjust the states at the start of the loop, we do not change these values yet.

### Final State
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is `n - 3`, `mex` is updated to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`, `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`**
