Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n - 1` to `0` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`. This means `i` starts at `n - 1` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `0`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` must be at least 1.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `mex` is updated to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop decrements `i` by 1, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `n - 2`.
   - The condition `t > 0` and `n >= 1` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies these values, but since no such modifications are mentioned, they stay the same.
   - `mex` will be updated again in the next iteration, but its exact value cannot be determined without knowing the loop body.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be `n - 2`.
   - `mex` will be updated to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]` (where `i` is now `n - 2`).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `mex` is updated to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[n - 2]`**
