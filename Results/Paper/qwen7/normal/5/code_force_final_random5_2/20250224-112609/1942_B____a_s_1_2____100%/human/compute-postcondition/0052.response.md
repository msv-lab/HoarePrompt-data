Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be `-1`, `mex` will hold the minimum value among all elements in the list `p`, and `p` will be updated such that each element `p[i]` is equal to `mex - a[i]` for its respective index `i`.

In simpler terms, after running through all iterations of the loop, the loop counter `i` will have decremented past `0` and will be `-1`. The variable `mex` will contain the smallest value found among all elements in the list `p`. The list `p` will have been updated so that each element `p[i]` is the result of subtracting the corresponding element `a[i]` from `mex`.
