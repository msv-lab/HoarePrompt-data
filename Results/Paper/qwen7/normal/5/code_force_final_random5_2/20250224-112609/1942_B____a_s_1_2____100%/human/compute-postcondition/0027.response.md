Output State: **`t` must be at least 2, `i` is `t - 2`, `n` is the same, `mex` is the minimum value between `n` and `p[i]`, `p[i]` is now `mex - a[i]`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` except for `p[i]` which is `mex - a[i]`**.

In this case, the code simply updates the value of `p[i]` to `mex - a[i]`. Since `mex` is defined as the minimum value between `n` and `p[i]`, and `p[i]` was previously set to `mex - a[i]`, the value of `p[i]` remains unchanged. All other variables retain their initial conditions.
