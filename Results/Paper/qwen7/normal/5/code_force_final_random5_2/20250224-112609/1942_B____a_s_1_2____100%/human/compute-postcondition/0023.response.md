Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(n - 1, -1, -1)`. This means the loop will iterate over the values of `i` starting from `n - 1` down to `0`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: According to the given state, `i` is currently set to `t - 1`.

3. **Determine the range of the loop**: The loop runs as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is within the valid range of the loop, which is from `n - 1` to `0`.

4. **Adjust the state of `i`**: Since `i` is initially set to `t - 1`, we need to ensure that `t - 1` is within the valid range of the loop. For the loop to start, `t - 1` must be greater than or equal to 0, and less than or equal to `n - 1`.

5. **Other relevant states**: The other variables (`n`, `mex`, `p`, and `a`) do not directly affect the loop's ability to start. They will be modified within the loop body.

Given these considerations, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

- `i` should be within the range `[0, n - 1]`.

Since `i` is initially set to `t - 1`, we need to ensure that `t - 1` is within this range. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `t - 1` is within the valid range for the loop.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be greater than 1 (to ensure t - 1 is within the valid range [0, n - 1]), `n` is an input integer, `i` is `t - 1`, `mex` is `n`, `p[i]` is now `mex - a[i]`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1`**
