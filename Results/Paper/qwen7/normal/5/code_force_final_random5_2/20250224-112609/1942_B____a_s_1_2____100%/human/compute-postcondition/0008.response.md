Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `mex` is updated to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. Since `p[i]` is defined as `mex - a[i]`, the exact value of `p[i]` is not specified, but it is known that `mex` is now at least as small as `p[i]`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
