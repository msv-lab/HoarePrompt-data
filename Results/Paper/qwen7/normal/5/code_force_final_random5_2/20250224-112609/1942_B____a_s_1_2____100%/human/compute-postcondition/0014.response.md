Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is `n - 3`, `mex` is updated to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`, `p[i]` is now `mex - a[i]`**

Explanation: The code updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. It also updates `p[i]` to be `mex - a[i]`. Since the exact values of `mex`, `p`, `i`, and `a` are not specified, we keep the conditions and relationships between the variables as described. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 and `n` must be at least 1 remains unchanged.
