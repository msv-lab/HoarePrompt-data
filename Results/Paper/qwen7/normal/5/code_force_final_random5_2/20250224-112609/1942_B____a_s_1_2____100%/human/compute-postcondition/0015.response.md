Output State: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is `0`, `mex` is updated to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`, `p[i]` is now `mex - a[i]` for all `i` in the range of `n`.

This means after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be 0 (since the loop decrements `i` from `n-1` to `0`), and `mex` will be the minimum value it was updated to during any iteration of the loop. For each index `i` from `n-1` to `0`, `p[i]` will be set to `mex - a[i]` where `mex` is the minimum value it had been updated to by the end of the loop.
