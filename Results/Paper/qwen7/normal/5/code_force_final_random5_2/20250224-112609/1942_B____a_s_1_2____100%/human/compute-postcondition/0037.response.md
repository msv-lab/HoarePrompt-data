Output State: **`t` is the input integer, `i` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `mex` is updated to be the minimum value between its original value and all elements in the list `p`, `p[1]` is `mex - a[1]`, `a` is updated to a list of integers obtained from input, `p` is a list of length `n` where each element is `mex - a[i]` for its respective index `i`.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from input and converts them into a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This list is assigned to the variable `a`. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `mex`, `p[1]`, and the structure of the list `p` remain as described in the initial state, except that `p[1]` is now specifically defined as `mex - a[1]` and `a` is updated to the newly read list of integers.
