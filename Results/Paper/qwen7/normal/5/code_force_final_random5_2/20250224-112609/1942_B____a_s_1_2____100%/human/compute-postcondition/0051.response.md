Based on the initial state described:

- `i` is `0`.
- `mex` is the minimum value of `mex` and all elements in the list `p` after all iterations of the loop.
- `p` is updated such that each element `p[i]` is equal to `mex - a[i]` for its respective index `i`.

After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will have reached `0` (since the loop decrements `i` from `n-1` to `0`). The variable `mex` will hold the minimum value between its initial value and all the values of `p[i]` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n-1`. Each element in the list `p` will be updated to be `mex - a[i]` for its respective index `i`.

The `print(*p)` statement will print the contents of the list `p` with each element separated by a space.

Since the exact values of `a` and `mex` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of the elements in `p`. However, we know that each element `p[i]` is updated to be `mex - a[i]`.

Output: **[mex - a[0], mex - a[1], ..., mex - a[n-1]]**
