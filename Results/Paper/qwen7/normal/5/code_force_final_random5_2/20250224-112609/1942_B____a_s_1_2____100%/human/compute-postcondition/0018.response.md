Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0
   - `n` must be at least 1
   - `i` is 0
   - `mex` is updated to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`
   - `p[i]` is now `mex - a[i]`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `t` times.
   - The loop starts with `i = 0` and decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration.
   - The loop continues as long as `i >= 0`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know that `i` is updated to `i - 1` in each iteration.

4. **Final State After Loop Completion:**
   - The loop will terminate when `i < 0`.
   - Since the loop starts from `i = 0` and decrements by 1, the loop will run exactly `t` times.
   - On the last iteration, `i` will be 0, and `mex` will be updated to be the minimum of itself and `p[0]`, and `p[0]` will be `mex - a[0]`.

5. **State Adjustment for Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop is about to start another iteration, `i` needs to be set to `t - 1` (the next value before decrementing).
   - `t` remains the same as it is the number of iterations.
   - `n` remains the same as it is not involved in the loop.
   - `mex` and `p[i]` will be updated based on the loop body, but since we are starting a new iteration, their values from the previous iteration are not relevant for the next iteration.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is `t - 1`, `mex` is updated to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`, `p[i]` is now `mex - a[i]`**.
