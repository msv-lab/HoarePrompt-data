Output State: **`t` is the input integer, `i` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `mex` is n, `p[1]` is `mex - a[1]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `p` is a list of length `n` where each element is `mex - a[i]` for its respective index `i`, `p` is initialized to a list of -1's of length `n`.**

Explanation: The line `mex = n` assigns the value of `n` to the variable `mex`. All other variables and their relationships remain unchanged.
