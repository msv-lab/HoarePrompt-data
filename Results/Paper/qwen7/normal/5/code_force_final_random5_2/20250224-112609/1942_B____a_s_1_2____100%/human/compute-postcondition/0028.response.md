Output State: **`t` must be at least 2, `i` is `t - 2`, `n` is the same, `mex` is updated to be the minimum value between its original value and `p[i]`, `p[i]` is now `mex - a[i]`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` filled with `-1` except for `p[i]` which is `mex - a[i]`**.

Explanation: The code updates `mex` to be the minimum value between its current value and `p[i]`. Since `p[i]` is already set to `mex - a[i]`, `mex` cannot be less than `p[i]`, so `mex` remains unchanged if `mex` was originally smaller than `p[i]`. If `mex` was originally larger, it gets updated to `p[i]`. All other variables remain in their initial state or as previously calculated.
