Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `p[i]` is `mex - a[i]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `p[i]` to `mex - a[i]`. Here, `i` is `n - 1` from the initial state. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. The new value of `p[i]` is derived from `mex - a[i]`, where `mex` and `a[i]` are not specified in the initial state, but their difference is assigned to `p[i]`.
