### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### 1. Function `func_1`:
The function `func_1` checks if a list is sorted in non-decreasing order. This part is correct and works as expected.

```python
def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst
```

#### 2. Main Logic:
The main logic of the program is flawed and does not correctly implement the required operations. Let's break down the issues:

- **Function Call Issue**: The program calls `func_1` but does not define it. This would indeed cause a runtime error. However, since the function is defined in the provided code, this issue is resolved.

- **Splitting Numbers**: The program attempts to split numbers greater than or equal to 10 into their individual digits and insert them back into the list. However, the logic for this is incorrect. Specifically:
  - The program does not correctly handle the splitting and reinsertion of digits.
  - The loop condition and logic inside the loop do not correctly check and modify the list to ensure it becomes sorted.

Let's examine the problematic parts of the main loop:

```python
for p in range(1, len(list1)):
    if not func_1(list1):
        if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
            a = list1[p - 1]
            list1.pop(p - 1)
            list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
            list1.insert(p, a % 10)
```

- **Condition Check**: The condition `if not func_1(list1)` checks if the list is not sorted. If the list is not sorted, it proceeds to the next part.
- **Splitting Logic**: The logic to split a number into its digits and insert them back is incorrect. The program incorrectly pops and inserts elements without ensuring the list remains in a valid state for further operations.

To illustrate with an example, consider the input `[12, 3, 45, 67]`:
- The program would attempt to split `12` into `[1, 2]`, but it does not correctly handle the reinsertion of these digits.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly implement the solution, we need to:
1. Split numbers greater than or equal to 10 into their digits.
2. Ensure the list remains sorted after each operation.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    while True:
        sorted_list = sorted(list1)
        if list1 == sorted_list:
            print('Yes')
            break
        
        for p in range(1, len(list1)):
            if list1[p - 1] >= 10 and list1[p - 1] > list1[p]:
                a = list1[p - 1]
                list1.pop(p - 1)
                list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p, a % 10)
                break
        else:
            print('No')
            break
```

This corrected version ensures that the list is checked and modified correctly until it is either sorted or determined to be unsortable.

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the analysis, the original assessment was accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the required logic for all potential cases.

**Final: False**
