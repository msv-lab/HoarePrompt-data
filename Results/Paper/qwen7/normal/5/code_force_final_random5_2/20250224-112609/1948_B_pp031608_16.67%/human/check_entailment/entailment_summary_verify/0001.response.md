### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Analysis**: The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the array and applying the specified operation to elements that are greater than or equal to 10. However, the implementation of the operation within the loop is indeed flawed.

2. **Flawed Operation Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined but never called with the updated list inside the loop.
   - The logic to split an element into its digits and insert them back into the list is not correctly implemented. Specifically, the code snippet `a = list1[p - 1]; list1.pop(p - 1); list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10); list1.insert(p, a % 10)` does not correctly handle the splitting of the number into digits.
   - The operation should split the number into its digits and insert them back into the list, but the current implementation only splits the number and inserts the quotient and remainder separately, which is incorrect.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - The operation needs to be applied iteratively until no more operations can be performed or the array is sorted.
   - A helper function should be used to perform the digit splitting and insertion.
   - After each operation, check if the array is sorted. If it is, break the loop and return `Yes`. If not, continue the process.

4. **Verification**:
   - The provided solution does not correctly implement the digit splitting and insertion logic.
   - The `func_1` function is not used effectively to check if the array is sorted after each operation.

However, upon closer inspection, the original assessment overlooks a key point: the provided program does attempt to solve the problem, albeit incorrectly. The main issue lies in the incorrect implementation of the digit splitting and insertion, rather than the overall approach.

To verify the correctness, let's consider the following:
- The program iterates through the array and checks if the previous element is greater than the current element and greater than 10.
- If so, it attempts to split the element and insert the digits back into the list.
- It then re-checks if the array is sorted using `func_1`.

While the logic is flawed, the program does attempt to solve the problem by repeatedly trying to sort the array through the specified operation. Given that the original assessment did not account for the fact that the program does attempt to solve the problem, it is not entirely accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment was accurate in identifying the flaws in the implementation but was overly critical of the overall approach. The program does attempt to solve the problem, even though the implementation is incorrect.
