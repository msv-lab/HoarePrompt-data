Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 1
   - `n` is defined and positive
   - `eta` is a list containing 1
   - If `q[j]` is greater than 0, then no change is made to the variables.

4. **Check if the loop can continue**:
   - Since `j` is currently 1 and `n` is defined and positive, the condition `j < n + 1` will hold true if `n` is greater than 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - Therefore, `n` must remain greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` will be incremented to 2.
   - `n` must remain greater than 1.

Given these points, the updated state for the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`j` is 2, `n` is defined and greater than 1, and `eta` is a list containing 1**.
