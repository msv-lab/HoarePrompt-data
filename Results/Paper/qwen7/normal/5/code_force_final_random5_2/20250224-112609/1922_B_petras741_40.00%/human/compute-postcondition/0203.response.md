Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n`, and a list `w` of `n` non-negative integers. It then calculates and prints a specific value based on the distribution of elements in the list `w`. If `n` is less than 3, it prints 0. Otherwise, it computes a combinatorial value related to the frequency of unique elements in the list `w`.**
