Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 0
   - `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 1.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `j < n`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`.

Given this information, we can update the state as follows:

- `j` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration.
- The condition for the loop to continue is `j < n`, so `n` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`j` is 1, `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
