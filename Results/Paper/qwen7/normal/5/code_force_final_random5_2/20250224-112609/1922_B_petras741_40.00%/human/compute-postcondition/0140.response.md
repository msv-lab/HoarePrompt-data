Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `t` is at least 1, `w` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `i` is 2, `j` is undefined, `eta` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` in ascending order if `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `eta_ln` is 1, `rho` is `q[0]`, `q` is now a list of length `n+1` where each element is 0, `w` is updated to a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string.**

Explanation:
- The line `q = [(0) for j in range(n + 1)]` initializes a list `q` with `n+1` elements, all set to 0.
- The values of `n`, `t`, `w`, `i`, `j`, `eta`, `eta_ln`, `rho`, and the updated `w` are as described in the initial state, except for `q`, which is now a list of zeros.
