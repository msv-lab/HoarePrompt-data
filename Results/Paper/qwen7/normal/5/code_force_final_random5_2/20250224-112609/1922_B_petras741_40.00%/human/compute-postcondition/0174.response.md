Output State: **`res` is increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, `j` is within the range [1, eta_ln), `eta_ln` is greater than 1.**

Explanation: The variable `res` was initially increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6`. Now, the same `res` is further increased by `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho`. The variable `j` remains within the range [1, eta_ln), and `eta_ln` is still greater than 1. The updated value of `res` is the sum of its previous value and the new increment.
