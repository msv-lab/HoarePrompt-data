Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` must be at least 3, `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `q` is a list containing `n + 1` zeros except for the index `w[0]` which is now 1, `j` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value at the index `w[j]` in the list `q` by 1. Initially, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros. Since `j` is 0, the code effectively increments the first element of `q` (index 0) by 1. Therefore, `q` now has its first element set to 1, while all other elements remain 0.
