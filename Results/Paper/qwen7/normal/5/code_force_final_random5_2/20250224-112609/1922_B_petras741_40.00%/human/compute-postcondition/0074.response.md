Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `i` is 1, `q` is a list of n+1 zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes `q` as a list of length `n + 1` where each element is set to 0. This is done using a list comprehension where `(0)` is repeated `n + 1` times. The values of `t`, `n`, `w`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states, and `q` is now a list filled with zeros of length `n + 1`.
