Postcondition: `t` is at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `i` is 1. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, then `j` is an integer, `eta` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` in ascending order, `eta_ln` is 1, `rho` is `q[0]`. If `eta_ln` equals 1, then `j` remains `n-1`, `eta_ln` remains 1, `res` is 0, and `rho` is `q[0]`. Otherwise, after the loop completes, `j` will be equal to `min(eta_ln, 1001)`, `eta_ln` remains unchanged and must be greater than 1, `res` will be the sum of all terms added in each iteration according to the loop, and `rho` will be the sum of all `q[eta[j]]` values added in each iteration. If `n` is less than 3, then `t` is at least 1, `n` is an input integer, `w` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `i` is 1, and `n` is less than 3.
