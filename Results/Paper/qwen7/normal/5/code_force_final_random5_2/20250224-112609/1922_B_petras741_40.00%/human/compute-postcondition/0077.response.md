Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop is defined as `for j in range(n):`. This means the loop variable is `j` and the condition for the loop to continue is that `j` should be less than `n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be at least 1.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `w[j]` is incremented by 1 in the loop body.

3. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and is incremented within the loop, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 1.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is still that `j` must be less than `n`, so `n` must remain at least 1.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `j`.

**Final State**:
- `n` must be at least 1 (unchanged from the previous state).
- `j` is incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 1.

State: **`n` must be at least 1, `j` is 1**
