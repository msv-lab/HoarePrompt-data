Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5), and a list a of n non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n). For each test case, the function returns information based on the given inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `t`, another positive integer `n`, and a list `a` of non-negative integers. The function processes these inputs and returns some form of output based on the given constraints and data.
