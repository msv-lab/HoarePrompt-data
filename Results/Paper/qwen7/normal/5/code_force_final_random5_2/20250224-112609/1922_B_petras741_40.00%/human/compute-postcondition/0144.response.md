Output State: **`j` is 1; `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1**

The code `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value of `q[w[j]]` by 1. Given that `j` is initially 1, `w[j]` refers to `w[1]`. Therefore, `q[w[1]]` is incremented by 1. The values of other variables (`n`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
