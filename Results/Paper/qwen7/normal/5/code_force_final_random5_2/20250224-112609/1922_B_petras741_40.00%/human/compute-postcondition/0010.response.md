Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `j < n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be at least 1.
   - `n` must be at least 3.
   - `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string.
   - `q` is a list containing `n + 1` zeros except for the index `w[0]` which is now 1.
   - `j` is 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts at 0 and the loop continues as long as `j < n`, the next value of `j` will be 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` must be at least 3, `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `q` is a list containing `n + 1` zeros except for the index `w[0]` which is now 1, `j` is 1**.
