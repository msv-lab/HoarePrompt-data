Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(1, eta_ln):`. The variables involved here are `j` and `eta_ln`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - From the given state, `j` is `-1`.
   - `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for j in range(1, eta_ln)` will execute if `eta_ln` is greater than 1 (since the range starts from 1).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `j` is `-1`, it does not satisfy the condition `j in range(1, eta_ln)`. Therefore, `j` needs to be adjusted to a value within the range `[1, eta_ln)`.
   - `eta_ln` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` and `eta_ln`.

**State after adjustment**:
- `j` should be set to a value within the range `[1, eta_ln)`.
- `eta_ln` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the final state is:
State: **`j` is within the range [1, eta_ln), `eta_ln` is greater than 1**
