Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `t` is at least 1, `w` is a list of integers converted from the input string, `i` is 2, `j` is -1, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` (from `n-1` down to `0`) for which `q[j]` was greater than 0 at any point during the loop's execution, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta` and is equal to 1, `rho` is the sum of all `q[eta[j]]` values encountered during the loop, and `res` is the sum of all the increments made to it during each iteration.**

This postcondition covers both the if and else parts of the if-else block. If `n >= 3`, `eta` will contain all indices `j` where `q[j]` was greater than 0, and the loop will continue until `j` reaches `eta_ln` or exceeds 1000. If `n < 3`, `eta` will simply contain all integers from 0 to `n-1` in ascending order, and `j` will be -1 as there are no elements to check. In both cases, `rho` and `res` are defined as per the respective conditions.
