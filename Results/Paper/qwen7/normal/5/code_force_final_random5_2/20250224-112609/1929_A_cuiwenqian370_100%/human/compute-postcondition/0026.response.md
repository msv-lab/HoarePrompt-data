Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `index` is increased by `n`; `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)'; `results` is a list containing the `result`.**

Explanation: The code appends the `result` (which is the return value of `func_1(array)`) to the list `results`. The other variables (`t`, `index`, and `result`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `t` must still be greater than 0, `index` is still increased by `n`, and `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`. The `results` list now contains the `result` added to it.
