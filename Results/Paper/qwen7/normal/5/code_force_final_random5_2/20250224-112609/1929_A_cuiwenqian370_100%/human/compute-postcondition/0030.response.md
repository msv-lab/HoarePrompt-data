Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is initialized to the sum of all `n` values plus 1.
- `index` is 0.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `result` is the last return value of `func_1(array)` computed during the loop.

Since the code snippet only contains a `print(result)` statement and no loop or function call is specified to compute `result`, we need to determine the value of `result` from the given information. 

Given that `result` is the last return value of `func_1(array)` computed during the loop, and there is no information about what `func_1(array)` does or what `array` is, we cannot determine the exact value of `result`. Therefore, the best we can do is to describe it as the last return value of `func_1(array)`.

Output: **the last return value of func_1(array)**
