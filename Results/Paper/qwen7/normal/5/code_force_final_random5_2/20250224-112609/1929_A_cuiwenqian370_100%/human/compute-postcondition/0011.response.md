Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `index` is increased by `n`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`, `results` list now contains the `result`.**

Explanation: The line `results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. The values of `t`, `index`, and `result` remain unchanged from their initial states. The only new information is that `results` now includes the `result` value.
