Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t)`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is at least 1.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be at least 1.
   - `index` is increased by `n`.
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`.
   - `results` list now contains the `result`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues if `t` is at least 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be at least 2 (because it was at least 1 before, and each iteration decreases `t` by 1).
   - `index` will be increased by `n` again.
   - `result` will be the return value of `func_1(array)` for the new iteration.
   - `results` list will contain the new `result`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `t` must be at least 2.
- `index` is increased by `n`.
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)` for the new iteration.
- `results` list now contains the new `result`.

So, the final state is:

**State: `t` must be at least 2, `index` is increased by `n`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`, `results` list now contains the new `result`.**
