Output State: **`t` must be at least 0, `index` is increased by `n + int(data[index]) + 1` and then further increased by `n`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`, `results` list now contains the `result`, `n` is `int(data[index])`, `array` is a list of integers created from `data[index:index + n]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the return value of `func_1(array)` to the variable `result`. This does not change the values of `t`, `index`, `n`, or the contents of the `results` list, except that `result` is now set to the return value of `func_1(array)`. The value of `array` remains unchanged as it is defined as a slice of `data` from `index` to `index + n`. The value of `n` remains the same as it was before the function call. The value of `index` is updated according to the given formula.
