### Reasoning

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the reasoning step by step:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.
   - The key insight is that sorting the array allows us to maximize these differences by ensuring the smallest elements are paired with the largest possible next elements.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function sorts the array and calculates the beauty by iterating through the sorted array and computing the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - The logic is correct because sorting ensures that the differences are maximized.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles reading multiple test cases and outputs the results.
   - The logic inside `func_2` is also correct as it properly uses `func_1` for each test case.

4. **Verification with Examples**:
   - The provided examples are correctly handled by the program.
     - Example 1: Input `[2, 1, 3]` → Sorted: `[1, 2, 3]` → Beauty: \(2\)
     - Example 2: Input `[69, 69, 69]` → Sorted: `[69, 69, 69]` → Beauty: \(0\)
     - Example 3: Input `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]` → Sorted: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]` → Beauty: \(57\)
     - Example 4: Input `[3, 4, 3, 3]` → Sorted: `[3, 3, 3, 4]` → Beauty: \(1\)
     - Example 5: Input `[2, 1]` → Sorted: `[1, 2]` → Beauty: \(1\)

### Conclusion

Based on the detailed analysis and verification, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

**Final: True**
