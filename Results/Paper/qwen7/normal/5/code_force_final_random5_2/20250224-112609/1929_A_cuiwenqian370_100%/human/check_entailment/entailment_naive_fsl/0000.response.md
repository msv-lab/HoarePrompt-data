Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly rearrange the array to maximize the beauty as described in the problem statement. The `func_1` function calculates the beauty of the array after sorting it, which does not necessarily yield the maximum possible beauty. For example, consider the input:

```
5
100 54 80 43 90
```

Sorting the array gives `[54, 80, 90, 100, 43]`, and the beauty calculated is `abs(80-54) + abs(90-80) + abs(100-90) + abs(43-100) = 26 + 10 + 10 + 57 = 93`. However, the optimal arrangement could be `[43, 100, 80, 90, 54]`, which gives a beauty of `abs(100-43) + abs(80-100) + abs(90-80) + abs(54-90) = 57 + 20 + 10 + 36 = 123`.

Thus, the program does not always find the maximum beauty, making it incorrect.
