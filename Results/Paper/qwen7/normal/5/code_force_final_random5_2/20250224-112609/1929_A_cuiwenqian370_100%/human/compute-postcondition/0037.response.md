Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers from standard input, then calls another function `func_1` to compute a result based on this list. It collects all these results into a list and prints them out. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that the number of remaining test cases (`t`) is 0, the `index` variable is updated to reflect the total number of integers read, and it outputs the computed results for each test case.**
