### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summaries to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function 1 Analysis:
```python
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
    return beauty
```
This function sorts the array and then calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements. This approach does not guarantee the maximum beauty because sorting the array does not account for the optimal arrangement of elements to maximize the beauty.

#### Function 2 Analysis:
```python
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(array)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```
This function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers from standard input, then calls `func_1` to compute the beauty of the array. It collects all these results into a list and prints them out. The function ensures that the number of remaining test cases (`t`) is 0, the `index` variable is updated to reflect the total number of integers read, and it outputs the computed results for each test case.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
The function summary states that `func_2` processes multiple test cases, reads the necessary data, calls `func_1` to compute the result, and prints the results. This aligns with the behavior of the provided code.

Given the function summary, we can see that `func_2` is designed to process multiple test cases and call `func_1` for each case. However, the original assessment is focused on the correctness of `func_1`, which is responsible for calculating the beauty of the array.

To verify the correctness of `func_1`, let's consider the example provided in the original assessment:
```
5
100 54 80 43 90
```
- Sorting the array gives `[54, 80, 90, 100, 43]`.
- The beauty calculated is `abs(80-54) + abs(90-80) + abs(100-90) + abs(43-100) = 26 + 10 + 10 + 57 = 93`.

However, the optimal arrangement could be `[43, 100, 80, 90, 54]`, which gives a beauty of `abs(100-43) + abs(80-100) + abs(90-80) + abs(54-90) = 57 + 20 + 10 + 36 = 123`.

Since `func_1` only sorts the array and does not consider other possible arrangements, it does not always find the maximum beauty. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because `func_1` does not always find the maximum beauty of the array.
