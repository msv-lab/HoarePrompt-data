Output State: **`t` must be at least 0, `index` is increased by `n + int(data[index]) + 1`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`, `results` list now contains the `result`, `n` is `int(data[index])`, `array` is a list of integers created from `data[index:index + n]`**.

Explanation: The code creates a list `array` by converting a slice of `data` (from `index` to `index + n`) into integers using `map(int, ...)`. The other variables (`t`, `index`, `result`, `results`, and `n`) remain unchanged in terms of their conditions or values but are updated with the new information about the `array` being created.
