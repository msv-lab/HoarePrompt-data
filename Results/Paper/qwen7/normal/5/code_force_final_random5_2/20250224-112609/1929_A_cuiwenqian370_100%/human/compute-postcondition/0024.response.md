Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0; `index` is increased by `n`; `array` is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting at `index + n` and of length `n`.**

Explanation: The value of `index` is incremented by `n`. The initial conditions for `t` and the definition of `array` remain unchanged. The new starting point for extracting the list `array` from `data` is now `index + n`.
