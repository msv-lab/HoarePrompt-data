Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `index` is increased by `n`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the return value of `func_1(array)` to the variable `result`. The function `func_1` is called with `array` as its argument, which is a list of integers extracted from `data` starting at `index - n` and of length `n`. The values of `t` and `index` remain unchanged from their initial state.
