Output State: **`t` must be at least 0, `index` is increased by `n + int(data[index]) + 1` and then further increased by `n`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`, `results` list now contains the `result`, `n` is `int(data[index])`, `array` is a list of integers created from `data[index:index + n]`**.

In more detail:
- The value of `index` was initially increased by `n + int(data[index]) + 1`.
- After that, `index` is further increased by `n`.
- All other variables remain unchanged and retain their previous values and conditions.
