Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t)`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is at least 1.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be at least 1.
   - `index` is increased by `n`.
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`.
   - `results` list now contains the `result`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop depends on `t`, we need to ensure `t` is at least 1 for the loop to continue.
   - `index` is increased by `n`, so if `t` was 1 before, it will be 0 after the current iteration.
   - `result` and `results` are already updated, so no changes are needed for these variables.

Given that `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to continue, and assuming `t` was at least 1 before the current iteration (since it's the first iteration or it continued from a previous iteration where `t` was at least 1), after the current iteration, `t` will be reduced by 1. Therefore, `t` must be at least 0 for the loop to continue, but since it was at least 1 before, it will be 0 after the current iteration.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t` must be at least 0, `index` is increased by `n`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`, `results` list now contains the `result`.**
