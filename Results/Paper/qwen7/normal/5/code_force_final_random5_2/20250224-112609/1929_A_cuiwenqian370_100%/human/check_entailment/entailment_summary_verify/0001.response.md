### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements: \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

2. **Key Insight**:
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest element is paired with the largest possible next element, maximizing the positive differences and minimizing the negative ones. This is the optimal strategy to achieve the maximum beauty.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly sorts the array and calculates the beauty by iterating through the sorted array and computing the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - The logic inside `func_1` is correct because sorting the array ensures that the differences are maximized.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles reading multiple test cases and outputs the results.
   - The logic inside `func_2` is also correct as it properly uses `func_1` for each test case.

5. **Verification with Examples**:
   - All provided examples are handled correctly by the provided functions.
     - Example 1: Input: `3 2 1 3` -> Sorted array: `[1, 2, 3]` -> Beauty: \((2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2\)
     - Example 2: Input: `3 69 69 69` -> Sorted array: `[69, 69, 69]` -> Beauty: \((69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0\)
     - Example 3: Input: `5 100 54 80 43 90` -> Sorted array: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]` -> Beauty: \((54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57\)
     - Example 4: Input: `4 3 4 3 3` -> Sorted array: `[3, 3, 3, 4]` -> Beauty: \((3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1\)
     - Example 5: Input: `2 2 1` -> Sorted array: `[1, 2]` -> Beauty: \((2 - 1) = 1\)

Given the analysis and verification, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
