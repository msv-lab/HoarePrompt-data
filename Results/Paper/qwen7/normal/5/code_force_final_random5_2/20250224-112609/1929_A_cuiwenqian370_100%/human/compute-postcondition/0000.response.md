Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, the input reading method changes to `sys.stdin.read`, and for each test case, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `array` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9]**.

The code changes the input reading method from the default input function to `sys.stdin.read`, but it does not assign any specific values to `t`, `n`, or `array`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain as described in the initial state.
