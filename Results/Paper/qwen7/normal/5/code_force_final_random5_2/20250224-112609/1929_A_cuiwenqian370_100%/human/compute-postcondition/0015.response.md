Output State: **`t` must be at least 0, `index` is increased by `n + int(data[index]) + 1`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(array)`, `results` list now contains the `result`, `n` is `int(data[index])`.**

Explanation: The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The updated value of `index` is the original value of `index` plus 1, which is equivalent to the original `index` plus `n + int(data[index])` plus 1.
