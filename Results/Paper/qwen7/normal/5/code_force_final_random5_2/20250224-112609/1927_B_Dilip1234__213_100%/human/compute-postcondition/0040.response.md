Postcondition: `char_count[j]` is equal to `a[i] + 2`. If `char_count[j]` equals `a[i]`, then `char_count[j]` is updated to `a[i] + 3`, `char_count` remains a list of integers, `a` remains a list of integers, `s` is the string `s` plus the character corresponding to index `j` in the alphabet, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. If `char_count[j]` does not equal `a[i]`, the conditions remain as initially stated.
