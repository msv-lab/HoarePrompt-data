Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, a))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the string, and a is a list of non-negative integers of length n, where each element a_i (0 <= a_i < n) represents the number of previous indices with the same character in the string.
def func_1(n, a):
    s = ''
    char_count = [0] * 26
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(26):
            if char_count[j] == a[i]:
                s += chr(j + ord('a'))
                char_count[j] += 1
                break
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is 26, `j` is 25, `n` must be greater than 26, `s` is the string 'abzdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy' repeated 3 times, which is 'abzdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyabzdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyabzdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy', and `char_count` is a list where `char_count[3]` is 3, `char_count[4]` to `char_count[25]` are each 3, and all other elements are 0.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` reaches 26, `j` reaches 25, `n` must be greater than 26, `s` contains the string 'abzdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy' repeated 3 times (making it 96 characters long), and `char_count` indicates that the characters corresponding to indices 3 ('d') to 25 ('z') have each appeared 3 times in the string `s`.
    return s
    #The program returns the string 'abzdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyabzdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyabzdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the length of the string, and `a`, a list of non-negative integers of length `n`. Each element `a_i` in `a` represents the number of previous indices with the same character in the string. The function constructs a string `s` based on these conditions and returns it. After execution, the function returns the string 'abzdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyabzdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyabzdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy'.
