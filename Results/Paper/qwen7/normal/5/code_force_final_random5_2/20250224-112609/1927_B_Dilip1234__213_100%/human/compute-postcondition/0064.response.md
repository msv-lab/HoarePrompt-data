Output State: **i is 26, j is 25, n must be greater than 26, s is equal to 'abzdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy', and char_count[3] is 1, char_count[4] to char_count[25] are each 1.**

Explanation: The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = 25`. After 3 iterations, `j` is 3. Since the loop continues as long as `n` is greater than 26 and there are characters left to process (as indicated by the output state after 3 iterations), it will continue until `j` reaches 25. At each iteration, `s` appends the corresponding character from the alphabet ('a' to 'z'), and `char_count[j]` is incremented. Once `j` reaches 25, the loop terminates, resulting in `s` being the full alphabet from 'a' to 'z' and `char_count[j]` for `j` from 3 to 25 each being 1.
