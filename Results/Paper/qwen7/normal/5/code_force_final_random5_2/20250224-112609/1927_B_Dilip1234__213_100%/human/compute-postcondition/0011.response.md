Output State: **`i` is 0; `j` is 2; `n` must be at least 1; `char_count[j]` is equal to `a[i] + 1`; `s` is equal to 'ab'**.

Explanation: The code `s += chr(j + ord('a'))` appends a character to the string `s`. Here, `j` is 1, so `chr(j + ord('a'))` evaluates to `chr(1 + 97)` which is `chr(98)`, resulting in the character 'b'. Thus, `s` changes from 'a' to 'ab'. The values of `i`, `j`, `n`, and `char_count[j]` remain unchanged.
