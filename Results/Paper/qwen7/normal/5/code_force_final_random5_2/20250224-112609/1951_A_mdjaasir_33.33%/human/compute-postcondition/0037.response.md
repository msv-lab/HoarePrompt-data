Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the value entered by the user as a string, `count` is the number of times '1' appears in `a`. The function checks if the first occurrence of '1' in `a` is followed by a different character. If true, the postcondition remains unchanged from the precondition. If false, the postcondition also remains unchanged from the precondition.**
