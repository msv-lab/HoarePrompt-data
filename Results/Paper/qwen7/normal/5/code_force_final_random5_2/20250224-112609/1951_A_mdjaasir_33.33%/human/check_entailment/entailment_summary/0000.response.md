Reasoning:
The given program `func()` is described as processing multiple inputs, counting the occurrences of the digit '1' in each input string, and printing 'YES' or 'NO' based on specific conditions. However, the provided code for `generate_files_for_html_in_range` does not match this description at all. Instead, it generates Python files (`-ac.py` and `-wa.py`) for HTML files found within directories whose names fall within a specified numeric range.

Given that the execution summary describes a different functionality (counting '1's in strings and printing 'YES' or 'NO'), and the provided code does not implement this functionality, the given program is not correct according to the execution summary.

Correctness: **False**
