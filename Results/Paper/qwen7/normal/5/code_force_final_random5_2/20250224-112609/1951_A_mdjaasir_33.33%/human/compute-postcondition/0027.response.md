Postcondition: `i` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the value entered by the user as a string, `count` is the number of '1's in the string `a`. If `count` is 0, `count` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `count` is greater than 2 and even, `count` remains unchanged. If `count` is 2, the index of the first '1' in `a` exists and the next character after the first '1' is not '1', or `a` contains at least two consecutive '1's.
