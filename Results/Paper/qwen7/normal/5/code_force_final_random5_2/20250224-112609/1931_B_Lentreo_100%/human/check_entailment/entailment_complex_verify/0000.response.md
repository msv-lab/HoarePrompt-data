### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness:

1. **Sum Divisibility Check**:
   - The program starts by checking if the total sum of water in all containers is divisible by `n`.
   - If the sum is not divisible by `n`, the program returns 'NO'.
   - This check ensures that the total amount of water can be evenly distributed among the containers, which is a necessary condition for making the amounts equal.

2. **Mean Calculation**:
   - If the sum is divisible by `n`, the program calculates the mean amount of water per container.
   - This mean value represents the target amount of water each container should have if they were to be made equal.

3. **Balance Check**:
   - The program then iterates through each container and maintains a running sum of the differences between the current container's water and the mean.
   - If at any point the running sum becomes negative, it indicates that it is impossible to achieve the desired distribution of water without violating the rule that water can only be poured from a container with more water to a container with less water.
   - If the running sum never goes negative, it means that the water can be redistributed to make all containers have the same amount of water.

The logic in the program is sound and aligns with the problem requirements. The program correctly identifies whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by ensuring the sum is divisible by `n` and verifying that the cumulative deviation from the mean remains non-negative.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the original assessment.
