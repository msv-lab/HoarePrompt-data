Output State: **`total` is equal to the sum of `nums`, `n` is the length of `nums` and must be greater than 0, the sum of `nums` is divisible by `n`, `mean` is `total` // `n`, `curr` is `nums[1] - mean + nums[2] - mean + nums[4] - mean`, `i` is 4**

Explanation: The value of `curr` is updated by adding `nums[i] - mean` where `i` is 4. So, `curr` now includes `nums[4] - mean`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
