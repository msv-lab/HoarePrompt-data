You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers representing the amounts of water in each container, where the length of nums is n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and the sum of nums is divisible by n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), with each element in nums being in the range 0 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func_1(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    total = sum(nums)
    if (total % n != 0) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    mean = total // n
    curr = 0
    for i in range(n):
        curr += nums[i] - mean
        
        if curr < 0:
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: Output State: `total` is equal to the sum of `nums`, `n` is the length of `nums` and must be greater than 0, the sum of `nums` is divisible by `n`, `mean` is `total` // `n`, `curr` is the sum of `nums[i] - mean` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is `n`, and if `curr` is less than 0 at any point during the loop, the function returns 'NO'. If the loop completes without returning 'NO', then `curr` will be 0 because the sum of all `nums[i] - mean` will cancel out to zero.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop, `curr` will be 0 (since the sum of deviations from the mean over all elements must balance out to zero), `i` will be equal to `n` (indicating the loop has completed all iterations), and the function will not have returned 'NO' unless `curr` went below 0 at some point during the loop.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers representing the amounts of water in each container. The length of `nums` is n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and the sum of `nums` is divisible by n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), with each element in `nums` being in the range 0 <= a_i <= 10^9. The function returns 'NO' in all cases except when it returns 'YES', indicating that a certain condition is met.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'NO'

Case_2: The program returns 'NO'

Case_3: The program returns 'NO'

Case_4: The program returns 'NO'

Case_5: The program returns 'YES'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
