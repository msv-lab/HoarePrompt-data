You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    print(func_1(nums))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers representing the amounts of water in each container, where the length of nums is n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and the sum of nums is divisible by n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), with each element in nums being in the range 0 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func_1(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    total = sum(nums)
    if (total % n != 0) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    mean = total // n
    curr = 0
    for i in range(n):
        curr += nums[i] - mean
        
        if curr < 0:
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: Output State: `total` is equal to the sum of `nums`, `n` is the length of `nums` and must be greater than 0, the sum of `nums` is divisible by `n`, `mean` is `total` // `n`, `curr` is the sum of `nums[i] - mean` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `i` is `n`, and if `curr` is less than 0 at any point during the loop, the function returns 'NO'. If the loop completes without returning 'NO', then `curr` will be 0 because the sum of all `nums[i] - mean` will cancel out to zero.
    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop, `curr` will be 0 (since the sum of deviations from the mean over all elements must balance out to zero), `i` will be equal to `n` (indicating the loop has completed all iterations), and the function will not have returned 'NO' unless `curr` went below 0 at some point during the loop.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to check if we can make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another, where the source container's index is always less than the destination container's index.

2. **Key Insight**: The key insight here is that the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers, meaning the average amount of water per container is an integer. If we can achieve this average amount in every container, the condition is satisfied.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by the number of containers (`n`). If not, it immediately returns 'NO'.
   - It then calculates the target amount of water per container (`mean`), which is the total amount divided by `n`.
   - It iterates through the list of water amounts and keeps track of the difference between the current cumulative amount and the expected cumulative amount if all containers had the mean value.
   - If at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, it means it's impossible to redistribute the water to meet the requirement, so it returns 'NO'.
   - If the loop completes without returning 'NO', it means the redistribution is possible, so it returns 'YES'.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge case where the total amount of water is not divisible by `n` correctly by returning 'NO' immediately.
   - The code also correctly handles the case where the redistribution is possible by ensuring the cumulative difference never goes negative.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

Correctness: **True**
