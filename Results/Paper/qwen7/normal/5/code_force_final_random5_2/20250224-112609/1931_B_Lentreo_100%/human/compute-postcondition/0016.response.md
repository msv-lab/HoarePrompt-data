Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is defined as `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `total` is equal to the sum of `nums`.
   - `n` is the length of `nums` and must be greater than 0.
   - The sum of `nums` is divisible by `n`.
   - `mean` is `total` // `n`.
   - `curr` is `nums[0] - mean`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `curr` is greater than or equal to 0.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - The variable `i` starts from 1 in the previous iteration. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 2.
   - The variable `n` remains unchanged because it is determined by the length of `nums`, which does not change within the loop.

4. **Formulate the New State:**
   - `total` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `n` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `mean` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `curr` is calculated based on the first element of `nums` minus `mean`, and since `i` is now 2, `curr` will be based on the second element of `nums` minus `mean`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`total` is equal to the sum of `nums`, `n` is the length of `nums` and must be greater than 0, the sum of `nums` is divisible by `n`, `mean` is `total` // `n`, `curr` is `nums[1] - mean`, `i` is 2, and `curr` is greater than or equal to 0**
