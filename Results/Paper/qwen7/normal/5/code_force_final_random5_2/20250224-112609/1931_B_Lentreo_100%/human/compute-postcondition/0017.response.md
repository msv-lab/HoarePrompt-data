Output State: **`total` is equal to the sum of `nums`, `n` is the length of `nums` and must be greater than 0, the sum of `nums` is divisible by `n`, `mean` is `total` // `n`, `curr` is `nums[1] - mean + nums[2] - mean`, `i` is 3, and `curr` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `curr` by adding `nums[i] - mean` to the current value of `curr`. Given that `i` was initially 2 and the increment operation increases `i` by 1, `i` becomes 3. Since `curr` was previously `nums[1] - mean`, after the update, `curr` becomes `nums[1] - mean + nums[2] - mean`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
