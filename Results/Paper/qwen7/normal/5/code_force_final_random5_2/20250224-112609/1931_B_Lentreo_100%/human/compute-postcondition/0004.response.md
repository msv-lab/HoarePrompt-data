Output State: **The program returns 'NO'**

Given the initial state, we know that the sum of `nums` (denoted as `total`) is divisible by `n` (the length of `nums`). However, the code snippet provided does not perform any operations that would change this state. Instead, it directly returns the string `'NO'`. Since no other operations are performed, the only thing that changes is the return statement itself, which explicitly returns the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the program returns **'NO'**.
