Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the specified operations. Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sum Calculation**: For each test case, the program calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by the number of containers (`n`). This is a crucial step because if the total sum is not divisible by `n`, it is impossible to make all containers have the same amount of water.
3. **Mean Calculation**: The program computes the mean amount of water per container.
4. **Deviation Check**: The program iterates through the list of water amounts and checks if the cumulative deviation from the mean remains non-negative. If at any point the cumulative deviation becomes negative, it means it is impossible to balance the water amounts across all containers, and the function returns 'NO'.
5. **Final Decision**: If the cumulative deviation never becomes negative, the function returns 'YES', indicating that it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

Given the execution summary and the provided example, the program behaves as expected and correctly determines the possibility of balancing the water amounts in all containers.

Correctness: **True**
