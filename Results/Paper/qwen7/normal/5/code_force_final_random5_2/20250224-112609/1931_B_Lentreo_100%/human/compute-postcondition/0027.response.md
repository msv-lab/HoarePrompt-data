Output State: **The program returns 'YES'**

Explanation: Given the initial state, we know that:
- `total` is the sum of `nums`.
- `n` is the length of `nums` and is greater than 0.
- The sum of `nums` is divisible by `n`.
- `mean` is calculated as `total // n`.
- `curr` is the sum of `nums[i] - mean` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
- `i` is set to `n`.

The code snippet provided does not perform any operations other than setting `i` to `n`. It also does not contain a loop or any conditional checks that would cause it to return 'NO'. Therefore, the only operation performed is setting `i` to `n`, and the function returns 'YES' without any further conditions being met or violated.
