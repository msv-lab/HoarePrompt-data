Output State: **`total` is equal to the sum of `nums`, `n` is the length of `nums`, and the sum of `nums` is divisible by `n`.**

Explanation: The code `total = sum(nums)` calculates the sum of all elements in the list `nums` and assigns it to the variable `total`. The precondition that the sum of `nums` is divisible by `n` remains valid because the sum is being calculated from the same list `nums`, and `n` is still the length of `nums`.
