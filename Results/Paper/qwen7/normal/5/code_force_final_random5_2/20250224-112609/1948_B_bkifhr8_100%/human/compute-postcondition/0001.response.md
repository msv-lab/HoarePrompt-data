Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop uses `_` as the iterator variable, which is a common practice when the value of the iterator is not needed within the loop body.
   - The loop runs `n` times.

2. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\).

3. **Analyze the Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will run `n` times, where `n` is the value of the variable `n`.
   - Since `_` is used, we don't need to adjust the value of `_` itself; instead, we need to ensure that the loop can execute `n` times.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - The loop will execute if `n` is a valid integer within the given range (i.e., \(2 \leq n \leq 50\)).
   - There is no need to adjust the value of `t` since it does not affect the loop's execution.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n`, ensuring it is within the specified range.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` must be an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50**
