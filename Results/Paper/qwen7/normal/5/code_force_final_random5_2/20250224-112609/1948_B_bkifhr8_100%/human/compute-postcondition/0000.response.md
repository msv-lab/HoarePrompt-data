Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it. The value of `n` is constrained to be between 2 and 50 (inclusive) because of the precondition specified in the problem statement.
