Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `ans` is True, and `arr` is a list of integers entered by the user.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
        nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
        if nums != sorted(nums):
            ans = False
            break
        arr[i - 1] = nums[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`, `arr[i]` is an integer that was less than `arr[i-1]`, `nums` is a list containing each digit of `arr[i-1]` followed by `arr[i]`, and if `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `nums` is sorted, the conditions remain the same as the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`, `arr[i]` is an integer that was less than `arr[i-1]`, `nums` is a list containing each digit of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]`, `ans` is set to `False`, and `i` is now `i - 1` if `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`; otherwise, the conditions remain the same as the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`, `arr[i]` is an integer that was less than `arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing each digit of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]` converted to a string and then to integers, `ans` is set to `False`, and `i` is now `i + 1`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same as the if part.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
