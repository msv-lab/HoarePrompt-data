Output State: **`arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`, `arr[i]` is an integer that was less than `arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing each digit of `arr[i - 1]` followed by `arr[i]` converted to a string and then to integers, `ans` is set to `False`, and `i` is now `i + 1`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This output state indicates that the `break` statement has been executed, which means we have exited the innermost loop or conditional block without changing the values of the variables `arr[i - 1]`, `arr[i]`, `nums`, `ans`, or `i`.
