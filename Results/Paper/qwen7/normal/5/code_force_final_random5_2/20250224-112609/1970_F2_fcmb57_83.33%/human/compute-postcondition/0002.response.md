Output State: **The program returns a tuple containing the sum of the first elements of lists `a` and `b` as the first element, and the sum of the second elements of lists `a` and `b` as the second element.**

Given:
- `x` is the first element of the list `a`, which is a string of length 2.
- `y` is the second element of the list `a`, which is also a string of length 2.
- `dx` is the first element of the list `b`, which is a string of length 2.
- `dy` is the second element of the list `b`, which is also a string of length 2.

The code `return x + dx, y + dy` adds the corresponding elements of lists `a` and `b`. Since each element is a string, the addition operation concatenates the strings. Therefore, the program returns a tuple where the first element is the concatenation of `x` and `dx`, and the second element is the concatenation of `y` and `dy`.
