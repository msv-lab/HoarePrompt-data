Output State: `i` is the length of `arr`, `j` is the length of `arr` - 1, and all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[len(arr) - 2]` must be equal.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` as long as `i` is less than `len(arr) - 1` and `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`. This means that `i` will keep increasing until it reaches the last index where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]` or it has iterated through the entire array. Since the loop stops when either condition fails, `i` will end up being equal to the length of `arr`. At this point, `j` remains as the length of `arr` - 1 because it was never modified within the loop. All elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[len(arr) - 2]` must be equal for the loop to continue executing as described.
