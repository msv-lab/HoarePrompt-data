Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is the length of `arr`.
   - `j` is the length of `arr` - 2.
   - `arr[len(arr) - 1]` must be equal to `arr[len(arr) - 2]`.

3. **Determine which variables affect the loop condition**:
   - The loop condition involves `j` and `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]`.
   - Therefore, we need to adjust `j` and the values in `arr` to satisfy the loop condition.

4. **Check the current values**:
   - `j` is currently `len(arr) - 2`.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be greater than 0 (`j > 0`).
   - Additionally, `arr[j]` must be equal to `arr[j - 1]`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `j` is currently `len(arr) - 2`, it is already greater than 0 (assuming `len(arr)` is at least 2).
   - We need to ensure that `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` holds true. Given that `arr[len(arr) - 1]` must be equal to `arr[len(arr) - 2]`, this condition is already satisfied.

6. **Final state**:
   - `i` remains the length of `arr`.
   - `j` remains `len(arr) - 2`.
   - No additional adjustments are needed for `arr` since the condition `arr[j] == arr[j - 1]` is already met.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:

**State: `i` is the length of `arr`, `j` is the length of `arr` - 2**
