### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - This part of the program is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The program calls `func_1(arr)` to compute the minimum cost required to make all elements of the array equal and prints the result.
   - This part of the program is also correct.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation.
   - However, there are issues with the logic used to determine the values of `i` and `j`:
     - The loop to find `i` increments `i` until it finds a pair of elements that are not equal or until it reaches the second last element of the array. This means `i` will be set to the index right after the last pair of equal consecutive elements, effectively making `i` equal to the length of the array. This is incorrect because `i` should be the index of the first element that is different from the next one.
     - Similarly, the loop to find `j` decrements `j` until it finds a pair of elements that are not equal or until it reaches the first element of the array. This means `j` will be set to 0, which is incorrect because `j` should be the index of the last element that is different from the previous one.
   - The condition `if (arr[0] == arr[-1])` checks if the entire array is uniform, but it is not necessary to check this explicitly since the function already handles the general case.
   - The calculation of the minimum cost is incorrect because it does not consider the correct ranges for `i` and `j`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, if the array has only one unique element, the function will incorrectly calculate the cost.
   - The function does not correctly identify the longest subarray where all elements are the same starting from the beginning or the end.

5. **Output**:
   - The function returns the incorrect minimum cost for making all elements of the array equal.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` has logical errors in determining the values of `i` and `j`, and the cost calculation is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final:
**False**
