Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is the length of `arr`, `j` is the length of `arr` - 1, and all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[len(arr)-2]` must be equal.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` as long as `i` is less than `len(arr) - 1` and `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`. This means that the loop will keep running until it finds a pair of elements that are not equal or until it reaches the second last element of the array. Therefore, after the loop completes, `i` will be set to the index right after the last pair of equal consecutive elements, effectively making `i` equal to the length of the array. The variable `j` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the loop. All elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[len(arr)-2]` must be equal for the loop to terminate in this manner.
Code of the loop:
while j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]:
    j -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is the length of `arr`, `j` is the length of `arr` - 2, and `arr[len(arr) - 1]` must be equal to `arr[len(arr) - 2]`
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is the length of `arr`, `j` is `j - 1`, and `arr[j]` is equal to `arr[j - 1]`
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is the length of `arr`, `j` is `j - 1`, and `arr[j]` is equal to `arr[j - 1]`


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
