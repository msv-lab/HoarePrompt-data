Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is the length of `arr` - 1, and `arr[1]` must be equal to `arr[2]`**

The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` is 2, so after executing the code, `i` becomes 3. The values of `j` and the condition involving `arr[1]` and `arr[2]` remain unchanged.
