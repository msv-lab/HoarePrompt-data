Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    print(func_1(arr))
    t -= 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the length of the list is n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= n.
def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    n = len(arr)
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is the length of `arr`, `j` is the length of `arr` - 1, and all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[len(arr)-2]` must be equal.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` as long as `i` is less than `len(arr) - 1` and `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`. This means that the loop will keep running until it finds a pair of elements that are not equal or until it reaches the second last element of the array. Therefore, after the loop completes, `i` will be set to the index right after the last pair of equal consecutive elements, effectively making `i` equal to the length of the array. The variable `j` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the loop. All elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[len(arr)-2]` must be equal for the loop to terminate in this manner.
    while j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]:
        j -= 1
        
    #State: `i` is the length of `arr`, `j` is 0, and all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[len(arr)-2]` are equal.
    if (arr[0] == arr[-1]) :
        return max(j - i - 1, 0)
        #The program returns the maximum value between j - i - 1 and 0, where j is 0 and i is the length of arr.
    #State: `i` is the length of `arr`, `j` is 0, and not all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[len(arr)-2]` are equal.
    return max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)
    #The program returns the maximum value between the minimum of (n - i - 1) and j, which is 0, given that not all elements from arr[0] to arr[len(arr)-2] are equal.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns a non-negative integer. It first checks if all elements from the start to the second last element of the array are equal. If they are, it returns the maximum value between `j - i - 1` and 0, where `j` is 0 and `i` is the length of `arr`. If not all elements are equal, it returns the maximum value between the minimum of `(n - i - 1)` and `j`, which is 0, where `n` is the length of `arr`.
