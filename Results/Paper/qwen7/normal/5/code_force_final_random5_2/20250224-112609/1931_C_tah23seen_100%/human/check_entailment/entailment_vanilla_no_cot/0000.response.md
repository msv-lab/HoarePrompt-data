Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not account for all possible ways to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation. The logic in `func_1` only considers the case where the entire array or a part of it can be made uniform without considering other potential optimal operations. 

To solve this problem correctly, you would need to find the minimum cost to make all elements equal by potentially splitting the array into segments and applying the operation to those segments. The current implementation only checks for uniformity at the start and end of the array and does not explore all possibilities.
