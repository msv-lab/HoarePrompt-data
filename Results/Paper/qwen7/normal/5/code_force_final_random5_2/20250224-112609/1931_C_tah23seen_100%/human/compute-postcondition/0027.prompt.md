You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the length of the list is n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= n.
def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    n = len(arr)
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is the length of `arr`, `j` is the length of `arr` - 1, and all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[len(arr)-2]` must be equal.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` as long as `i` is less than `len(arr) - 1` and `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`. This means that the loop will keep running until it finds a pair of elements that are not equal or until it reaches the second last element of the array. Therefore, after the loop completes, `i` will be set to the index right after the last pair of equal consecutive elements, effectively making `i` equal to the length of the array. The variable `j` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the loop. All elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[len(arr)-2]` must be equal for the loop to terminate in this manner.
    while j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]:
        j -= 1
        
    #State: `i` is the length of `arr`, `j` is 0, and all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[len(arr)-2]` are equal.
    if (arr[0] == arr[-1]) :
        return max(j - i - 1, 0)
        #The program returns the maximum value between j - i - 1 and 0, where j is 0 and i is the length of arr.
    #State: `i` is the length of `arr`, `j` is 0, and not all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[len(arr)-2]` are equal.
    return max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)
    #The program returns the maximum value between the minimum of (n - i - 1) and j, which is 0, given that not all elements from arr[0] to arr[len(arr)-2] are equal.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter arr, which is a list of integers. It returns the maximum value between j - i - 1 and 0, where j is 0 and i is the length of arr. If not all elements from arr[0] to arr[len(arr)-2] are equal, it returns the maximum value between the minimum of (n - i - 1) and j, which is 0.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the maximum value between j - i - 1 and 0, where j is 0 and i is the length of arr.

Case_2: The program returns the maximum value between the minimum of (n - i - 1) and j, which is 0, given that not all elements from arr[0] to arr[len(arr)-2] are equal.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
