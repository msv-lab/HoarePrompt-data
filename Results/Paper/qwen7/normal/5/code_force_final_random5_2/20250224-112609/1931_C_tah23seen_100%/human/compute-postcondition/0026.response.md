Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter arr, which is a list of integers. It returns the maximum value between j - i - 1 and 0, where j is 0 and i is the length of arr. If not all elements from arr[0] to arr[len(arr)-2] are equal, it returns the maximum value between the minimum of (n - i - 1) and j, which is 0.**
