Output State: `i` is the length of `arr`, `j` is the length of `arr` - 1, and all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[len(arr)-2]` must be equal.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` as long as `i` is less than `len(arr) - 1` and `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`. This means that the loop will keep running until it finds a pair of elements that are not equal or until it reaches the second last element of the array. Therefore, after the loop completes, `i` will be set to the index right after the last pair of equal consecutive elements, effectively making `i` equal to the length of the array. The variable `j` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the loop. All elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[len(arr)-2]` must be equal for the loop to terminate in this manner.
