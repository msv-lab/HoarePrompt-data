Output State: **`i` is the length of `arr`, `j` is the length of `arr` - 2, and `arr[len(arr) - 1]` must be equal to `arr[len(arr) - 2]`**.

Explanation: The value of `j` is decremented by 1, changing its value from `len(arr) - 1` to `len(arr) - 2`. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
