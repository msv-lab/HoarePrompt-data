Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Loop Head Conditions
The loop condition is:
```python
while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
```

This means the loop will continue as long as both conditions are true:
1. `i < len(arr) - 1`
2. `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`

### Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is 1
- `j` is the length of `arr` - 1
- `arr[0]` must be equal to `arr[1]`

### Analyzing the Loop Condition
1. **Condition 1: `i < len(arr) - 1`**
   - Currently, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(arr) - 1`.
   - Since `i` is currently 1, `i` must be incremented to a value where `i < len(arr) - 1`.

2. **Condition 2: `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`**
   - Currently, `i` is 1, so we need to check `arr[1] == arr[2]`.
   - The condition `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` must be true for the loop to continue.

### Adjusting the States
- To satisfy the first condition (`i < len(arr) - 1`), `i` must be incremented.
- To satisfy the second condition (`arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`), `arr[1]` must be equal to `arr[2]`.

Since the second condition depends on the values in the array, we cannot directly adjust the array state without knowing the exact values. However, we can ensure that `i` is incremented to a position where the second condition might still hold true.

### Final State Adjustment
- Increment `i` to a value where `i < len(arr) - 1`.
- Ensure that `arr[1] == arr[2]` holds true for the loop to continue.

Given these considerations, the final state adjustment would be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `j` is the length of `arr` - 1, and `arr[1]` must be equal to `arr[2]`**
