### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the size of the array (`n`) and the array itself (`arr`). This part is correct.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates through the array to find the first position (`i`) where the elements are not equal.
   - Then, it iterates backward to find the last position (`j`) where the elements are not equal.
   - The logic to calculate the cost of making all elements equal is flawed:
     - The condition `if (arr[0] == arr[-1]) :` checks if the first and last elements are equal. If they are, it calculates the cost as `max(j - i - 1, 0)`.
     - Otherwise, it calculates the cost as `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost calculation should consider the optimal way to make all elements equal using at most one operation. The current implementation does not correctly handle this.
   - The correct approach would involve finding the longest subarray of equal elements and calculating the cost to make the rest of the array equal to any element in that subarray.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function does not handle edge cases such as when the entire array is already equal or when there are multiple segments of equal elements.
   - The current logic only considers the first and last unequal elements, which may not yield the minimum cost.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
