Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to distribute coins across different outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. This involves finding a distribution \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) such that \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i\) for all \(i\).

2. **Key Insight**: The key insight here is to find a common multiple of the multipliers \(k_i\) that ensures the condition is met. The function `func_1(a, b)` computes the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using their greatest common divisor (GCD). Function `func_2(numbers)` extends this to compute the LCM of all multipliers in the list.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the input and calls `func_2` to compute the LCM of the multipliers.
   - It then divides this LCM by each multiplier to get the bet amounts.
   - It checks if the sum of these bet amounts is less than or equal to the LCM. If it is, it prints `-1` because it violates the condition. Otherwise, it prints the bet amounts.

4. **Function `func_1` and `func_2`**:
   - `func_1(a, b)` correctly computes the LCM of two numbers.
   - `func_2(numbers)` correctly computes the LCM of a list of numbers by iteratively applying `func_1`.

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The constraints ensure that the LCM will be within the required bounds (since the maximum value of \(k_i\) is 20).
   - The solution provided handles all given examples correctly.

Given the above analysis, the program logic is sound and correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
