Output State: The `result` variable will be the value returned by applying `func_1` successively to the initial `result` and each element in the `numbers` list, starting from the second element to the last element.

In more detail, if the `numbers` list has \( n \) elements, then after all iterations of the loop, the `result` will be equivalent to:

\[ result = func_1(\ldots func_1(func_1(initial\_result, numbers[1]), numbers[2]), \ldots, numbers[n-1]) \]

where `initial_result` is the first element of the `numbers` list, and the loop iterates over the remaining elements of the list.
