Output State: The `result` variable will be the value returned by `func_1(func_1(func_1(initial_result, numbers[1]), numbers[2]), numbers[3])`, assuming `numbers` has at least 4 elements. In this final state, `numbers` is a list of integers with a length equal to or greater than 4, and `result` is the cumulative result of applying the `func_1` function successively to the initial `result` and each subsequent element in the `numbers` list.
