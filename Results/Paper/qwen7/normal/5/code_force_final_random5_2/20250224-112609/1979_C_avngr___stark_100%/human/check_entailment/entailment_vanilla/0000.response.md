Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to distribute coins among \( n \) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each winning outcome. Each outcome has a multiplier \( k_i \), and we need to find non-zero integer bets \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) such that:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \quad \text{for all } i \]

### Given Functions
1. **func_1(a, b)**:
   - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers \( a \) and \( b \).
   - It uses the formula: \(\text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{|a \cdot b|}{\gcd(a, b)}\).

2. **func_2(numbers)**:
   - This function calculates the LCM of a list of numbers.
   - It iteratively applies `func_1` to compute the LCM of the entire list.

### Program Logic
- The program does not directly solve the problem as stated. Instead, it computes the LCM of the multipliers \( k_i \).
- The LCM computation alone does not help in distributing the coins such that the condition is met.

### Correctness Check
To determine if the given program correctly solves the problem, let's consider the following points:

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - We need to find bets \( x_i \) such that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for each outcome.
   - The LCM calculation does not inherently provide a solution to this requirement.

2. **Leveraging LCM**:
   - While the LCM can be useful in some contexts, it does not directly help in finding the required distribution of bets.
   - The LCM of the multipliers \( k_i \) does not guarantee a valid distribution of bets.

3. **Example Verification**:
   - For the example provided in the problem, the program would compute the LCM but not necessarily provide a valid distribution of bets.

### Conclusion
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. It only computes the LCM of the multipliers without addressing the core requirement of distributing the bets appropriately.

**Correctness: False**
