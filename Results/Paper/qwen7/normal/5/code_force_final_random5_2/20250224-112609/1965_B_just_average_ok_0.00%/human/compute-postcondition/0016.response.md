Output State: **`idx` is 23, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) with an additional element `k - 2^{23}` and `k + 1` appended to it, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` is appended to the list `nums`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `k + nums[idx] + 1` to the list `nums`. Given that `idx` is 23, `nums[idx]` is `2^{23}`. So, the new element appended to `nums` is `k + 2^{23} + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
