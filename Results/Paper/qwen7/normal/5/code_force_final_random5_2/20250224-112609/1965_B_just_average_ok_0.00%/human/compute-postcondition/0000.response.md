Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**: The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. This value will be assigned to the variable `_` in each iteration of the loop.

3. **Understand the constraints**: The problem states that for each test case, `n` and `k` are positive integers satisfying \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\) and \(1 \leq k \leq n\). Additionally, the sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed \(10^7\).

4. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop will run based on the input value, we need to ensure that the input value is within the specified range for the number of test cases. The initial state tells us that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), which means the loop will run exactly `t` times.

Given this information, we need to ensure that the loop can execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.

**State:**
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)**
