Output State: **`idx` is 4, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is `current_iterations + 1`, `k` must be at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\), and `k + nums[idx] + 1` is in the list `nums`.**

Explanation: The code `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. Initially, `idx` was 3, so after executing the code, `idx` becomes 4. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, and `nums`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
