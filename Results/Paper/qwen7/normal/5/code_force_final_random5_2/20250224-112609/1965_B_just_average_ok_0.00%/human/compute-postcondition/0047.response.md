Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `k >= 1 << idx`.

2. **Determine the variables involved in the loop condition**: The variables involved are `k` and `idx`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `idx` is 2.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` must be greater than or equal to 2.
   - `nums` is a list containing the integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\).

4. **Evaluate the loop condition with the current state**:
   - The loop condition is `k >= 1 << idx`.
   - Given `idx` is 2, the condition becomes `k >= 1 << 2`, which simplifies to `k >= 4`.

5. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `k >= 4` must be true.
   - Since `k` must be greater than or equal to 2 initially, and the condition checks if `k` is at least 4, we need to ensure that `k` is at least 4.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - The only variable directly involved in the loop condition is `k`, so we need to ensure that `k` is at least 4.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `k must be at least 4`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`idx` is 2, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 4, `nums` is a list containing the integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\)**
