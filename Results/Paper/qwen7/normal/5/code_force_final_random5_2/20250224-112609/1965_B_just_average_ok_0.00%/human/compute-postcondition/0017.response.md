Output State: **`idx` is 23, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) with an additional element `k - 2^{23}` and `k + 1` appended to it, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` is in the list `nums`, but the element \(1 << idx\) (which is \(1 << 23\)) is removed from the list `nums`.**

Explanation: The code removes the element \(1 << idx\) from the list `nums`. Since `idx` is 23, the element removed is \(2^{23}\). The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged. The updated list `nums` no longer contains \(2^{23}\), but all other elements remain as specified in the initial state.
