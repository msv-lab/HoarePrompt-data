Output State: **`idx` is 23, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) with an additional element `k - 2^{23}` and `k + 1` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `nums.append(k + 1)` appends the value `k + 1` to the list `nums`. The initial list `nums` contains integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) and an additional element `k - 2^{23}`. After appending `k + 1`, the list `nums` now includes all these elements plus `k + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
