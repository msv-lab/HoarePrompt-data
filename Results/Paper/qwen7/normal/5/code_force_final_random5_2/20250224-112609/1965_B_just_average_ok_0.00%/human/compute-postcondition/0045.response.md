Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `k >= 1 << idx`.

2. **Current States**:
   - `idx` is 1.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `nums` is a list containing the integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\).

3. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables involved in the loop head are `idx` and `k`.

4. **Determine the Next Iteration Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `k >= 1 << idx` must still hold true.
   - Since `idx` is currently 1, the condition becomes `k >= 1 << 1`, which simplifies to `k >= 2`.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `k` is still greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to continue.
   - The value of `idx` remains unchanged as it is already set to 1.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is `k` must be greater than or equal to 2.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`idx` is 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 2, `nums` is a list containing the integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\)**
