Output State: **`idx` is 23, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is `current_iterations + 1`, `k` must be at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) with an additional element `k - 2^{23}` and `k + 1` appended to it, `k + nums[idx] + 1` is in the list `nums`, but the element \(1 << idx\) (which is \(1 << 23\)) is removed from the list `nums`.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The value of `idx` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The value of `t` is also not affected. The value of `n` is updated to be `current_iterations + 1`, where `current_iterations` is the value read from the input. The value of `k` remains the same as it was initially defined. The list `nums` is modified according to the given conditions, but no specific values are provided for the elements within `nums` other than the general conditions mentioned.
