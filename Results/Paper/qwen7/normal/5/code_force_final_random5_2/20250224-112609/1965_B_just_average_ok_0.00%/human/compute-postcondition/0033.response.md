Output State: **`idx` is 24, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is `current_iterations + 1`, `k` must be at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) with an additional element `k - nums[idx]`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` is in the list `nums`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `k - nums[idx]` to the list `nums`. Given that `idx` is 24, `nums[idx]` is \(2^{24}\). Therefore, the new element added to `nums` is `k - 2^{24}`. The other variables remain unchanged.
