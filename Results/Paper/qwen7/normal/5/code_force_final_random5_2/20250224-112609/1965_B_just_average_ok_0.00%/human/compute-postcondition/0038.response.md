Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `idx` is 24.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). The value of `t` does not affect the list `nums`, so it is not directly relevant here.
   - `n` is `current_iterations + 1`. Since `current_iterations` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `n`, but it doesn't affect the list `nums` either.
   - `k` must be at least 16777216. This value is important for determining the additional elements added to `nums`.
   - `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) excluding \(2^{24}\). This means `nums` initially contains the integers from 1 to 8,388,607 (which is \(2^{23} - 1\)).
   - `nums` now also contains `k - nums[idx]` and `k + nums[idx] + 1`. Given `idx` is 24, `nums[idx]` would be \(2^{24}\), but since \(2^{24}\) is excluded from the initial list, we need to consider the actual value at index 24, which is 16,777,216 (since the list contains \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\)).

2. **Adding Elements to `nums`:**
   - `k - nums[idx]` would be \(k - 16,777,216\).
   - `k + nums[idx] + 1` would be \(k + 16,777,216 + 1 = k + 16,777,217\).

3. **Final List `nums`:**
   - The list `nums` initially contains integers from 1 to 8,388,607.
   - It then adds \(k - 16,777,216\) and \(k + 16,777,217\).

Given these details, the final list `nums` will contain:
- Integers from 1 to 8,388,607.
- \(k - 16,777,216\).
- \(k + 16,777,217\).

Since `k` is at least 16,777,216, both \(k - 16,777,216\) and \(k + 16,777,217\) are valid integers.

Therefore, the print statement `print(*nums)` will output the list `nums` with the specified elements.

Output: **1, 2, 4, ..., 8388607, k - 16777216, k + 16777217** (where the ellipsis represents the sequence of integers from 1 to 8,388,607)
