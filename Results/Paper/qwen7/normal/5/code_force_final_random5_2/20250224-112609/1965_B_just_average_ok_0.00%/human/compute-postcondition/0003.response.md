Output State: **`idx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\).**

Explanation: The line `idx = 0` initializes the variable `idx` to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `nums` remain unchanged from their initial state.
