Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is simply `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `int(input())`, which determines how many times the loop will run.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `idx` is 23
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `k` must be at least 16777216
   - `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) with an additional element `k - 2^{23}` and `k + 1` appended to it
   - `k + nums[idx] + 1` is in the list `nums`, but the element \(1 << idx\) (which is \(1 << 23\)) is removed from the list `nums`

3. **Determine the Next State**: For the loop to execute one more time, we need to determine what the value of `int(input())` should be. Since the loop is controlled by `int(input())`, the only thing that changes is the number of iterations.

4. **Adjusting the States**: We need to ensure that the loop can execute one more time. This means we need to increase the count of iterations by 1. Let's denote the current number of iterations as `current_iterations`.

5. **Final State**: After the next iteration, the number of iterations will be `current_iterations + 1`. Therefore, the new value of `int(input())` should be `current_iterations + 1`.

Since the loop head does not involve any other variables, we do not need to adjust any other states.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`idx` is 23, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an input integer, `k` must be at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) with an additional element `k - 2^{23}` and `k + 1` appended to it, `k + nums[idx] + 1` is in the list `nums`, but the element \(1 << idx\) (which is \(1 << 23\)) is removed from the list `nums`, and `int(input())` is `current_iterations + 1`**.
