Output State: **`idx` is 24, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is `current_iterations + 1`, `k` must be at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) with an additional element `k - nums[idx]` and now also contains `k + nums[idx] + 1**.

Explanation: The code appends the value `k + nums[idx] + 1` to the list `nums`. Given that `nums[idx]` is \(2^{24}\) (since `idx` is 24 and `nums` contains integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) plus one more element which is `k - nums[idx]\)), the new element added to `nums` is `k + 2^{24} + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
