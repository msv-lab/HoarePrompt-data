Output State: `idx` is 25, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is `current_iterations + 1`, `k` must be at least 16777216, `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\), and `k + nums[idx] + 1` is in the list `nums`.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `idx` as long as `k` is greater than or equal to \(1 << idx\). Given that `idx` increases by 1 each iteration and the loop runs 3 times up to `idx` being 4, it implies that \(1 << 4 = 16\) is the threshold where the loop stops increasing `idx`. Since \(2^{23} = 8388608\) and the loop condition checks against powers of 2, the maximum value of `idx` would be 23 (since \(1 << 23 = 8388608\)). However, the problem specifies that the loop continues until `k` no longer meets the condition, and given the constraints, `idx` will reach 25 because \(16777216 = 2^{24}\) and the loop will continue until `k` is less than \(1 << 25\), which means `idx` will be incremented to 25 before the loop exits.
