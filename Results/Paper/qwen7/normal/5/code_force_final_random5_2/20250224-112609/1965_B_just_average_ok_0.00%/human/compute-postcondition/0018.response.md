Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Descriptions:**
   - `idx` is explicitly given as 23.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). This value does not affect the length of `nums`, so we don't need to consider it further.
   - `n` is an input integer, but it doesn't influence the length of `nums` either.
   - `k` must be at least 16777216.
   - `nums` is a list containing integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) with an additional element `k - 2^{23}` and `k + 1` appended to it. This means `nums` initially contains the integers from 1 to \(2^{23}\) (i.e., from 1 to 8388608) plus two more elements: `k - 8388608` and `k + 1`.
   - The element \(1 << idx\) (which is \(1 << 23\)) is removed from the list `nums`.

2. **Calculating the Length of `nums`:**
   - Initially, `nums` contains 24 elements (from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\) inclusive, plus two extra elements).
   - Removing \(1 << 23\) (which is 8388608) from the list reduces the count by 1.
   - Therefore, the final length of `nums` is \(24 - 1 = 23\).

3. **Print Statement Execution:**
   - The print statement `print(len(nums))` will output the length of the list `nums`.

Given this reasoning, the output will be:

Output: **23**
