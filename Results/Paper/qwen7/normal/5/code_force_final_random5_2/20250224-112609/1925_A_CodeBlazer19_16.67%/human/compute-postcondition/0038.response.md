Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 < t \leq 676\), `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the input split by space and converted to an integer, `k` is 105, `s` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `j`, `j` must be within the range `[97, 202]`**.

Explanation: The code `s += chr(j)` appends the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `j` to the string `s`. Since `j` is within the range `[97, 202]`, `s` now contains one additional character. All other variables remain unchanged.
