Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 < t \leq 676\), `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the input split by space and converted to an integer, `k` is 105, `s` is the string "b" (since `chr(98)` is 'b'), `j` is 98**

The code `s += chr(j)` appends the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `j` (which is 'b') to the string `s`. Initially, `s` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `j`, which is "b". Therefore, after executing the code, `s` becomes "b" + "b" = "bb". All other variables remain unchanged.
