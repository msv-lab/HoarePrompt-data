Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `j in range(97, k + 97)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 676\)
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `k` is an input integer
   - `s` is the string 'a' followed by the character with ASCII value 98 (which is 'b')
   - `j` is 98

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for values of `j` starting from 97 up to `k + 97 - 1`. For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `k + 97`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: Since `j` was 98 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented to 99. Therefore, `j` should be set to 99.

5. **Keep other states unchanged**: The other states (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `s`, and `j`) should remain as they were unless explicitly changed by the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume no changes are made to these variables.

Based on the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 676\), `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is the string 'a' followed by the character with ASCII value 98 (which is 'b'), `j` is 99**
