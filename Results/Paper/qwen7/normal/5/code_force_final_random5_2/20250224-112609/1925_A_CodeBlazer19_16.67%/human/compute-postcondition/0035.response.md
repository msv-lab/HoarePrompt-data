Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 < t \leq 676\), `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer from the input split by space and converted to an integer, `k` is 105, `s` is the string 'z' repeated 105 times, `j` is 202**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part to an integer. The first integer is assigned to `n`, and the second integer (which is 105) is assigned to `k`. The values of `t`, `i`, `s`, and `j` remain unchanged.
