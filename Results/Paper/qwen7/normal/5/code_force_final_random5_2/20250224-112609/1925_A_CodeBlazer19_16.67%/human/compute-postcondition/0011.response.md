Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 676\), `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `j` is 106.

Explanation: The loop runs from `j = 97` to `j = k + 96`. Given that the loop executed 3 times as per the provided states, we can infer that `k` must be 105 (since the loop increments `j` each time and stops at `k + 97`). Therefore, after all iterations, `j` will be 106, and `s` will contain all characters from 'a' to 'z'.
