Output State: **`size_overlap` is (1, 0), `i` must be greater than or equal to 0, `size` is `i + 1`, `value` is `(1 << i + 1) - (1 << i)`, `number` must be greater than or equal to 1**.

The code `size += 1` increments the first element of the tuple `size_overlap` by 1, changing its value from (0, 0) to (1, 0). The other variables (`i`, `size`, `value`, and `number`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.
