Output State: `size_overlap` is (25, 3), `i` is 3, `size` is 25, `number` must be greater than or equal to 4194296, `value` is 33554430.

This output state indicates that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `size_overlap` has been set to (25, 3). This means that the final values of `size` and `i` are 25 and 3 respectively. The value of `number` must be at least 4194296, and the `value` calculated during the last iteration is 33554430.
