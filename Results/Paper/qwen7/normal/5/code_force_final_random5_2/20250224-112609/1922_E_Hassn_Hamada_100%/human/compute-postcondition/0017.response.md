Output State: `size_overlap` is (3, 0), `i` is greater than or equal to 2, `size` is `i + 1`, `number` must be greater than or equal to `3 * (1 << (i - 1))`, `value` is `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`.

After the loop executes all its iterations, the final state will have `i` being greater than or equal to 2 because the loop increments `i` until it no longer satisfies the condition `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number`. The `size` variable will be `i + 1` due to the increment inside the loop. The `value` is updated to `(1 << size) - (1 << i)` after the last iteration, and `size_overlap` remains (3, 0) as no further changes are specified for it. The `number` must be greater than or equal to `3 * (1 << (i - 1))` to ensure the loop ran sufficiently many times.
