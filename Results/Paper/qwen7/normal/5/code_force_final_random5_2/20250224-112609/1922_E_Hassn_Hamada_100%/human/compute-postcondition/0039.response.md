Postcondition: **`size_overlap` is (21, 2), `i` is 2, `size` is 21, `number` must be at least 2044, and `value` is 2046.**

Explanation: Given the if condition `value <= number`, if the condition is true, the loop breaks and the values remain as follows: `size_overlap` is (21, 2), `i` is 2, `size` is 21, `number` must be at least 2044, and `value` is 2046. Since there is no else part, these values persist after the if statement executes.
