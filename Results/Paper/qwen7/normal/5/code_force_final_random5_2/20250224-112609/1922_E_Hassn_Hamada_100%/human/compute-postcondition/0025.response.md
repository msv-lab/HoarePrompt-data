Let's analyze the given `while` loop condition and determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time.

### Given Loop Condition:
```python
while (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Initial States:
- `size_overlap` is (3, 0)
- `i` is 2
- `size` is 2
- `number` is greater than or equal to 3
- `value` is 2
- `size` is 2, `value` is 2, and so on (repeated multiple times)

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition Analysis**:
   - The loop condition is `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number`.
   - We need to evaluate this condition with the initial values:
     - `size` is 2
     - `i` is 2
     - `number` is greater than or equal to 3

2. **Evaluate the Expression**:
   - Calculate `1 << size + 1`:
     - `size + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`
     - `1 << 3 = 8`
   - Calculate `1 << i`:
     - `i = 2`
     - `1 << 2 = 4`
   - Substitute these values into the condition:
     - `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) = 8 - 4 = 4`
   - The condition becomes `4 <= number`.

3. **Determine the Adjustment**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `4 <= number` must be true.
   - Since `number` is initially greater than or equal to 3, we need to ensure that `number` is at least 4 for the condition to hold true.

### Final Adjusted State:
- `size_overlap` is (3, 0)
- `i` is 2
- `size` is 2
- `number` must be at least 4 (since it is initially greater than or equal to 3, we need to ensure it is exactly 4 to satisfy the condition for the first iteration).

### Final Answer:
State: **`size_overlap` is (3, 0), `i` is 2, `size` is 2, `number` must be at least 4**
