Output State: `size_overlap` is (25, 3), `i` is 3, `size` is 25, `number` must be greater than or equal to 4194296, `value` is 33554430.

This output state indicates that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `size_overlap` has been updated to (25, 3). This means that the final values of `size` and `i` that satisfy the condition within the loop are 25 and 3, respectively. The variable `i` is set to 3 after the loop completes, and `size` is calculated as `i + 1`, which equals 25. Additionally, the condition for `number` must be met, which is being greater than or equal to 4194296. The value of `value` is 33554430, which is the result of the calculation `(1 << size) - (1 << i)` when `size` is 25 and `i` is 3.
