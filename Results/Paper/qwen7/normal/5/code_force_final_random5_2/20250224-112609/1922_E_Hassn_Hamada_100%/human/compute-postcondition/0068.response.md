Output State: `size` is 25, `overlap` is 3, `i` is 22, `sequence` contains [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25].

To understand this output state, let's break it down:
- The loop runs from `i = 3` to `i = size - overlap`, which is `i = 25 - 3 = 22`. This means the loop will iterate 22 - 3 + 1 = 20 times.
- In each iteration, the value of `i` increases by 1, starting from 3.
- During each iteration, the value `i + overlap` (which starts as 6) is appended to the list `sequence`.
- After 20 iterations, the final value of `i` will be 22.
- The `sequence` list will contain all integers from 6 to 25 inclusive, as each integer is appended in order during the loop iterations.
