Output State: **`size_overlap` is (1, 0), `i` must be greater than or equal to 0, `size` is `i + 1`, `value` is `(1 << (i + 1)) - (1 << i)`, `number` must be greater than or equal to 1**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `value` to `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`. Given that `size` is `i + 1`, the expression simplifies to `(1 << (i + 1)) - (1 << i)`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
