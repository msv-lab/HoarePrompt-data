Output State: **`size` is 25, `overlap` is 3, `i` is 3, `sequence` contains [6]**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i + overlap` to the list `sequence`. Given that `i` is 3 and `overlap` is 3, `i + overlap` equals 6. Therefore, `sequence` now contains the value 6. The values of `size` and `overlap` remain unchanged, and `i` is also unchanged.
