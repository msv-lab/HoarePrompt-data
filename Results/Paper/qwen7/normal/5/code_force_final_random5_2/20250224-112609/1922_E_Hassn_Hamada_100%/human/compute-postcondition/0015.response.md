Output State: **`size_overlap` is (3, 0), `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `size` is `i + 1`, `number` must be greater than or equal to `3 * (1 << (i - 1))`, `value` is `(1 << (i + 1)) - (1 << i)`; `value` is updated to `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `value` to `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`. Given that `size` is `i + 1`, we can substitute `size` with `i + 1` in the expression for `value`. Thus, `value` becomes `(1 << (i + 1)) - (1 << i)`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
