You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `number` (where \(2 \leq number \leq 10^{18}\)) and a list of integers `sequence`. It generates a new sequence based on the input `number` and updates the `sequence` list. If `number` is 0, it returns two zeros. Otherwise, it calculates a pair of values (`size` and `i`) and uses them to fill the `sequence` list with specific integers. Finally, it recursively calls itself with a modified `number` and the updated `sequence`. The function ultimately returns two zeros, regardless of the input values.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires generating an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences, `X`. The solution uses a recursive function `func_1` to generate this array.

2. **Recursive Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to generate a sequence of numbers based on the input `number`.
   - It uses bit manipulation to determine the structure of the sequence.
   - The goal is to create a sequence where the number of increasing subsequences matches the target `X`.

3. **Base Case**:
   - When `number == 0`, the function returns immediately, indicating the base case of the recursion.

4. **Recursive Case**:
   - The function iterates backward from the maximum value in the current sequence to 0.
   - For each value `i`, it calculates the size and value of the next segment of the sequence.
   - It checks if the calculated value fits within the remaining `number` and updates the sequence accordingly.
   - The function recursively calls itself with the updated `number` and appends the generated segment to the sequence.

5. **Sequence Generation**:
   - The sequence is built by appending values that ensure the number of increasing subsequences matches the target `X`.
   - The sequence is constructed using powers of 2, which helps in ensuring the correct count of increasing subsequences.

6. **Output**:
   - The length of the generated sequence is printed first.
   - Then, the sequence is printed as space-separated integers.

### Verification:

- The function correctly handles the base case when `number == 0`.
- The recursive function ensures that the sequence is built in a way that matches the target number of increasing subsequences.
- The sequence generation logic is consistent with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic to generate an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences.

### Correctness:

**True**
