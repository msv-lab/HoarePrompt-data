Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `size - overlap`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < size - overlap`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `size` is 25
   - `overlap` is 3
   - `i` is 3
   - `sequence` contains [6]

4. **Calculate the loop condition**: 
   - The loop runs from `i` to `size - overlap`.
   - For the current values, `size - overlap` is `25 - 3 = 22`.
   - The loop continues as long as `i < 22`.

5. **Check if the loop can continue**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - Since `3 < 22`, the loop can continue.

6. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `4`.
   - `size` and `overlap` remain unchanged.
   - `sequence` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`size` is 25, `overlap` is 3, `i` is 4, `sequence` contains [6]**
