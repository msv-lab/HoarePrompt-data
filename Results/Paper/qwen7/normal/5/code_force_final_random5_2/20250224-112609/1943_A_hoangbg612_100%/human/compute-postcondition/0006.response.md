Output State: **`cur` is -1, `T` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2⋅10^4, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of sorted integers, `M` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary `M`. The values of `cur`, `T`, `S`, and `N` remain unchanged from their initial states.
