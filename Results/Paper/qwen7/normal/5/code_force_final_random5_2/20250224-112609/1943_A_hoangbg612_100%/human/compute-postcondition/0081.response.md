Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `num` and `N`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `N`. The loop body increments `M[cur]` by 1 if `num` is not greater than `cur`, or sets `cur` to `num` and sets `M[cur]` to 1 if `num` is greater than `cur`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `N` is not empty.
   - `M[cur]` is incremented by 1 if `num` is not greater than `cur`.
   - If `num` is greater than `cur`, then `cur` is equal to `num` and `M[cur]` is set to 1.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop is about to start a new iteration, the current value of `num` from the previous iteration is no longer relevant.
   - The list `N` will now be used to provide the next value for `num`.
   - The variable `cur` will be updated based on the new `num` according to the loop logic.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `N` remains the same as it is the list being iterated over.
   - `cur` will be updated based on the new `num` from the next iteration.
   - `M[cur]` will be set to 1 if `num` is greater than `cur` (since this is the first time `num` is being processed in this iteration).

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated `cur` and the initial condition for `M[cur]`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`N` is not empty, `cur` is the first element of `N`, `M[cur]` is 1**
