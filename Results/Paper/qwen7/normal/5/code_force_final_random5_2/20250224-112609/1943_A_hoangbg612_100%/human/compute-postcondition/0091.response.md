Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `num` and `N`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in `N`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `N` is not empty.
   - `cur` is either `num` and `M[cur]` remains 1, or `cur` is the first element of `N` and `M[cur]` is 2.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `num` in `N`, at the end of the previous iteration, `num` was the last element processed from `N`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `N` must still contain at least one element (otherwise, the loop would terminate).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `N` must still be non-empty because if it were empty, the loop would terminate.
   - `cur` will now be the new `num` (the next element in `N`), and `M[cur]` will remain 1 (since the loop body does not change this value unless specified otherwise).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`N` is not empty, `cur` is the next element in `N` and `M[cur]` remains 1**.
