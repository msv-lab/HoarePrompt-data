Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `num`, which iterates over the list `N`.

2. **Determine the initial state needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `N`.
   - Since `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, the loop will execute if `N` is not empty.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - We need to ensure that `N` is not empty for the loop to execute.
   - The other variables (`T`, `cnt`, `S`, `cur`, and `M`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and their values do not affect whether the loop can execute or not.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the state of the list `N`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`N` must not be empty**
