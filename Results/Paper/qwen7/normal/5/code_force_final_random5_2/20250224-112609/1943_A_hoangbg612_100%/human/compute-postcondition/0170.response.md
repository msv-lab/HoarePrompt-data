Output State: **`cnt` is a list with the last element being `k`.**

Explanation: The line `cnt.append(k)` adds the value of `k` to the end of the list `cnt`. Since the initial state does not specify the contents of `cnt` before this operation, we only know that after executing this line, `k` is appended to `cnt`. All other information about the initial state remains unchanged.
