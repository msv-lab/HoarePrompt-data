Output State: **`T` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2⋅10^4, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of sorted integers.**

Explanation: The code `N.sort()` sorts the list `N` in ascending order. The values of `T` and `S` remain unchanged. Therefore, `T` is still a positive integer within the range 1 to 2⋅10^4, `S` is still an input integer, and `N` is now a list of its original integers sorted in ascending order.
