Postcondition: **`cnt` will contain all keys `k` from the dictionary `M` where `M[k]` equals 1, in the order they were added. The variable `cur` will be the highest value present in the list `N`. The dictionary `M` will only contain keys that are present in `N` with a count of 1. All other values in `M` will be zero or represent counts of numbers less than `cur` in `N`. The list `N` remains a non-empty list of integers sorted in ascending order. The variable `T` is decreased by the total number of iterations the loop executed. If the sum of all values in `M` equals `S`, `cur` is increased by 1; otherwise, no changes are made to `cur` and `M`. If `len(cnt)` is greater than or equal to 2, `cur` is set to the second element in the list `cnt`.**
