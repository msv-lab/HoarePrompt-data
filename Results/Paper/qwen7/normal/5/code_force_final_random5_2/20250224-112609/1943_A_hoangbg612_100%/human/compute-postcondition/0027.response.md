Output State: **`cur` is `num`, `T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 2 \times 10^4\), `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list with at least one fewer element, `M` is a dictionary, and `M[cur]` is 1.**

In this output state, the dictionary `M` has been updated such that the key `cur` (which is equal to `num`) has been assigned the value `1`. All other variables retain their initial states as described in the initial state.
