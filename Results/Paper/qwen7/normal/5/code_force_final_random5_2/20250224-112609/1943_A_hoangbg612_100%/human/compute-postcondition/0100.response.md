Output State: **All elements in `N` have been processed, `cur` is the last element in `N`, and `M[cur]` is 1 if `cur` was not previously in `M`, or it is incremented by 1 for each occurrence of `cur` in `N`.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, every element in the list `N` will have been processed. The variable `cur` will hold the last element of `N` since the loop increments `cur` only when it finds a new maximum. For each unique element in `N`, `M[cur]` will be set to 1 initially (if it's the first occurrence) or incremented by 1 for each subsequent occurrence of that element.
