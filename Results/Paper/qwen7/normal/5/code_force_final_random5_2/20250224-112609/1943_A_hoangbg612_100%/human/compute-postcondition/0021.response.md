Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for num in N:`. The variables involved in this loop are `num` and `N`.

2. **Understand the Loop Body**: Although the loop body is omitted, we know from the postcondition that if `num` is greater than `cur`, then `M[cur]` is set to 1 and `cur` is updated to `num`. Otherwise, `M[-1]` is set to 1 and `cur` is set to -1.

3. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `cur` is an integer.
   - `T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 2 \times 10^4\).
   - `S` is an input integer.
   - `N` is a list with at least one element.
   - `M` is a dictionary.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over each element in `N`, at the end of the previous iteration, `N` has lost one element (the one that was just processed).
   - `cur` will be either the same as it was before or updated based on the value of `num` from the previous iteration.

Given these points, let's adjust the state for the next iteration:

- `N` must now have at least one fewer element than it did previously.
- `cur` will remain the same unless `num` from the previous iteration was greater than `cur`, in which case `cur` would be updated to `num`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `num` from the previous iteration, we can only say that `N` will have one fewer element and `cur` will remain unchanged unless updated.

**State:**
- `cur` is an integer.
- `T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 2 \times 10^4\).
- `S` is an input integer.
- `N` is a list with at least one fewer element than before.
- `M` is a dictionary.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`cur` is an integer, `T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 2 \times 10^4\), `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list with at least one fewer element, and `M` is a dictionary.**
