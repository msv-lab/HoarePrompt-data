Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for num in N:`. The key variables here are `num` and `N`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - `num` is the current element being processed from the list `N`.
   - `M[cur]` keeps track of the count of how many times `cur` has been encountered.
   - If `num` is greater than `cur`, then `M[cur]` is updated to 1.
   - Otherwise, `M[cur]` is increased by 1.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `num` is the next element in the list `N`, at the start of the next iteration, `num` will be the next element in `N`.
   - The variable `cur` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `cur` is the current value being tracked.
- `M[cur]` is the count of how many times `cur` has been encountered.
- `num` is the next element in the list `N`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `num` will be the next element in the list `N`.
- `cur` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `cur` remains the same.
- `M[cur]` remains the same.
- `num` is now the next element in the list `N`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`cur` is the current value being tracked, `M[cur]` is the count of how many times `cur` has been encountered, `num` is the next element in the list `N`**
