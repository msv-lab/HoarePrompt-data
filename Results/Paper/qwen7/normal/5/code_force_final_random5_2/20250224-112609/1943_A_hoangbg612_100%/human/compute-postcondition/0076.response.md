Output State: **`N` is not empty, `num` is greater than `cur`, `cur` is equal to `num`, `M[cur]` is 1**

Explanation: The code assigns the value `1` to `M[cur]`. Since `cur` is equal to `num`, `M[num]` is set to `1`. The other variables (`N`, `num`, and `cur`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
