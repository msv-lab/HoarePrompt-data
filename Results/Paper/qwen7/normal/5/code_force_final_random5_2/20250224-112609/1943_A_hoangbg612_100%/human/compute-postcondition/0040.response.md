Output State: **All elements in the list `N` have been processed, `cur` is the last unique number encountered or -1 if no such number exists, `T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 2 \times 10^4\), `S` is an input integer, and `M` is a dictionary where keys are the unique numbers from `N` (or -1) that are greater than `cur` and their values are 1, and for all other keys in `M`, the values are the counts of occurrences of those numbers in `N`.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `cur` will either be the largest number in `N` that is greater than the previous value of `cur` found in the loop, or it will be -1 if no such number was found. The dictionary `M` will contain entries for each unique number in `N` that is greater than `cur` with a value of 1, and for any other number in `N`, the value in `M` will be the count of how many times that number appears in `N`.
