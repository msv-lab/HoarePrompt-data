Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic as described in the problem statement. Here are the key issues:

1. **Game Logic Mismatch**: The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob as described. Instead, it simply counts the occurrences of each unique integer in the sorted array `N`. This does not reflect the strategic play of Alice and Bob where Alice tries to maximize the MEX and Bob tries to minimize it.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of MEX**: The program calculates the MEX based on the counts of unique integers rather than simulating the game turns. This means it does not account for the sequence in which elements are picked and removed, which is crucial for determining the optimal MEX.

3. **Output Determination**: The program attempts to determine the MEX based on the counts of unique integers, which is not aligned with the optimal strategy for the game. It also incorrectly handles the determination of the MEX by checking the length of `cnt` and setting `cur` accordingly.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly simulate the game or compute the optimal MEX as required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
