Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `N` is a non-empty list of integers sorted in ascending order.
- `num` is the current integer being processed from the list `N`.
- `cur` is the current value being tracked.
- `M[cur]` is the count of how many times `cur` has been encountered.

### Loop Head
```
for num in N:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Loop Body Analysis
- If `num` is greater than `cur`, then `cur` is updated to `num` and `M[cur]` is set to 1.
- Otherwise, `cur` remains the same, and `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Determine the Current Value of `num`:**
   - Since the loop is about to start another iteration, `num` is the next element in the list `N`.

2. **Determine the Current Value of `cur`:**
   - The value of `cur` is determined by the previous iteration. If `num` was greater than `cur` in the previous iteration, `cur` was updated to `num`. Otherwise, `cur` remained the same.

3. **Determine the Current Value of `M[cur]`:**
   - If `num` was greater than `cur` in the previous iteration, `M[cur]` would be 1.
   - Otherwise, `M[cur]` would be incremented by 1 in the previous iteration.

### Adjusted States
- `num` will be the next element in the list `N`.
- `cur` will either remain the same as the previous `cur` if `num` is not greater, or it will be updated to `num` if `num` is greater.
- `M[cur]` will either be incremented by 1 (if `num` is not greater) or set to 1 (if `num` is greater).

### Final State
Given the above reasoning, the final state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `num` is the next element in the list `N`.
- `cur` is the current value being tracked.
- `M[cur]` is the count of how many times `cur` has been encountered.

Since the exact values of `num`, `cur`, and `M[cur]` depend on the previous iteration, we can summarize the state as follows:

State: **`N` is a non-empty list of integers sorted in ascending order, `num` is the next element in the list `N`, `cur` is the current value being tracked, and `M[cur]` is the count of how many times `cur` has been encountered.**
