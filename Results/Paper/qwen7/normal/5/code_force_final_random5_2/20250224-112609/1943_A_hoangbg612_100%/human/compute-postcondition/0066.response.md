Output State: **`T` is `T-1`, `cnt` is a list, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `cur` is -1.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `cur` to -1. This does not affect the values of `T`, `cnt`, `S`, or `N`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
