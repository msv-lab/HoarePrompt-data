Output State: **T is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2⋅10^4.**

The code `T = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `T`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), the same condition applies to the new variable `T`. The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.
