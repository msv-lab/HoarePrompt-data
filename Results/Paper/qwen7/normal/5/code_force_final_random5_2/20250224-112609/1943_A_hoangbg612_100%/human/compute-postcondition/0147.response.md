Postcondition: **`cur` is the current value being tracked, `M[cur]` is the count of how many times `cur` has been encountered. If `num` is greater than `cur`, then `M[cur]` is updated to 1. Otherwise, `M[cur]` is increased by 1. `N` is a non-empty list of integers sorted in ascending order, and `num` is the next element in the list `N`.**
