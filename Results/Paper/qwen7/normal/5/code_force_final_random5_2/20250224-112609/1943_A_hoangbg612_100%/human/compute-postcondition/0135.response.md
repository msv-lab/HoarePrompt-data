Output State: **`N` is a non-empty list of integers sorted in ascending order, `cur` is equal to `num`, and if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code `cur = num` assigns the value of `num` to `cur`. The initial conditions and the condition related to breaking out of the loop or if statement remain unchanged. Therefore, `N` remains a non-empty list of integers sorted in ascending order, and the condition about breaking out of the loop or if statement also remains the same.
