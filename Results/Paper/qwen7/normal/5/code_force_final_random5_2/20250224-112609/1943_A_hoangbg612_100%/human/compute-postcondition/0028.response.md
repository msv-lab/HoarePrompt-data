Output State: **`cur` is an integer; `T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 2 \times 10^4\); `S` is an input integer; `N` is a list with at least one fewer element; `M` is a dictionary; `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.**

In this case, the dictionary `M` has its value at key `cur` incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
