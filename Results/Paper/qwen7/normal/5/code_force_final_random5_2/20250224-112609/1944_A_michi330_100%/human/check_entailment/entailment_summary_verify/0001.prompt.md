You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Example

Input

    6
    
    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    4 1
    
    5 10
    
    5 3
    
    4 4

Output

    2
    1
    4
    1
    5
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it checks if \( k \) is greater than or equal to \( n - 1 \). If true, it prints 1; otherwise, it prints \( n \). The function reads \( t \) test cases from the input, where \( t \) is a positive integer between 1 and 1000. After processing all test cases, it outputs the results for each case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates over each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.
   - The condition `if k >= n - 1:` checks if the number of bridges that can be destroyed (`k`) is greater than or equal to `n - 1`.
     - If true, it prints `1`. This means that if Dominater can destroy at least `n - 1` bridges, Everule can only stay on island 1.
     - If false, it prints `n`. This implies that even with fewer bridges destroyed, Everule can still reach all islands.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - **Case 1:** When `k >= n - 1`
     - If `k` is indeed greater than or equal to `n - 1`, destroying `n - 1` bridges would leave Everule isolated from all other islands. This part is correct.
   - **Case 2:** When `k < n - 1`
     - If `k` is less than `n - 1`, Everule should still be able to reach all islands because he can always find a path through the remaining bridges. However, the program incorrectly prints `n` instead of ensuring that Everule can still reach all islands despite the destruction of some bridges.

### Example Analysis:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `2 0`
  - Expected Output: `2`
  - Program Output: `2` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `2 1`
  - Expected Output: `1`
  - Program Output: `1` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `4 1`
  - Expected Output: `4`
  - Program Output: `4` (Incorrect)
  - Explanation: Even with one bridge destroyed, Everule should still be able to reach all islands (e.g., travel via a detour).

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `5 10`
  - Expected Output: `1`
  - Program Output: `1` (Correct)

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `5 3`
  - Expected Output: `5`
  - Program Output: `5` (Incorrect)
  - Explanation: With three bridges destroyed, Everule might still be able to reach all islands depending on which bridges are destroyed.

- **Test Case 6:**
  - Input: `4 4`
  - Expected Output: `1`
  - Program Output: `1` (Correct)

### Conclusion:

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where `k < n - 1` properly. It assumes that Everule cannot reach any other islands when `k < n - 1`, which is not necessarily true.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
