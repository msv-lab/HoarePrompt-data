Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^3\).
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is the first integer input converted to an integer.
- `k` is the second integer input converted to an integer.

The `print(n)` statement will print the value of `n`, which is the first integer input converted to an integer.

Output: **n (where n is the first integer input converted to an integer)**
