Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^3, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The initial state of `t` and `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, `t` must still be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^3, and `i` is still 0. The values of `n` and `k` are the integers input by the user.
