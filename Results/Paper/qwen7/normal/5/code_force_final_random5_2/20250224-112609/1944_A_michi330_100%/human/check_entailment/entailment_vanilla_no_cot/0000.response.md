Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Specifically, it fails to handle cases where the optimal strategy involves destroying fewer than \(n-1\) bridges but more than zero bridges. Here's why:

1. **Case Analysis:**
   - If \(k \geq n - 1\), the program correctly prints `1`, meaning Everule can only visit island 1 because all other bridges are destroyed.
   - However, if \(k < n - 1\), the program incorrectly prints `n` instead of determining the minimum number of islands Everule can visit.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - To find the minimum number of islands Everule can visit, we need to consider the following:
     - If \(k < n - 1\), Everule can still visit some islands by avoiding the destroyed bridges.
     - The key is to determine which bridges to destroy to minimize the reachable islands while ensuring that Everule cannot visit more than necessary.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach is to ensure that Everule cannot reach more than \( \lceil \frac{n}{k+1} \rceil \) islands. This means we need to calculate the minimum number of islands such that even after destroying \(k\) bridges, Everule can still reach at least one island from each group of islands.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            # Calculate the minimum number of islands Everule can visit
            min_islands = math.ceil((n - 1) / (k + 1)) + 1
            print(min_islands)

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that the minimum number of islands Everule can visit is calculated correctly for all cases.
