Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^3, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer input converted to an integer, `k` is the second integer input converted to an integer.** 

This postcondition remains unchanged because both the if and else parts do not alter the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `k`. The conditions specified in the precondition are preserved in both branches of the if-else statement.
