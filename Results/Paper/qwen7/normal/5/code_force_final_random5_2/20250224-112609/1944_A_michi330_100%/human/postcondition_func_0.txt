The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it checks if \( k \) is greater than or equal to \( n - 1 \). If true, it prints 1; otherwise, it prints \( n \). The function reads \( t \) test cases from the input, where \( t \) is a positive integer between 1 and 1000. After processing all test cases, it outputs the results for each case.
