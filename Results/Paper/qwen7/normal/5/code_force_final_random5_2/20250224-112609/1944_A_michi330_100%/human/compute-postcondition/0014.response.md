Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `t`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < t`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^3\).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is the first integer input.
   - `k` is the second integer input.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `t`. Therefore, `t` must remain the same and should still satisfy the condition \(0 < t \leq 10^3\).

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `t` remains the same and must still be greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^3\).

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^3, `i` is 2, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input.**
