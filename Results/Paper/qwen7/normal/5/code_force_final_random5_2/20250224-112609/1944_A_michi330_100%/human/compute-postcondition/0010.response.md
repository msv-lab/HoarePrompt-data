Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^3, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The variable `t` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `t` must still be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^3, `i` is still 1, `n` is now the first integer input, and `k` is the second integer input.
