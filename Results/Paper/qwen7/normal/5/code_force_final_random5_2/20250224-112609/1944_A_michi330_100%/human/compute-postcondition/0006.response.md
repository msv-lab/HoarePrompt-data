Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^3\).
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer and `k` is less than `n - 1`.

The `print(n)` statement will simply print the value of the variable `n`, which is an input integer.

Output: **n (where n is an input integer)**
