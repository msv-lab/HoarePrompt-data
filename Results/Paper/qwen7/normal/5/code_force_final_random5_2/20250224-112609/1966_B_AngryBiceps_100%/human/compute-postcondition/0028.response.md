Postcondition: `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is a valid integer, `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each being the input received during the corresponding iteration of the loop. The variable `first_row` is a string consisting of the first character of each string in the list `a`. The variable `last_row` is a string consisting of the last character of each string in `a`, and each character appears twice in `last_row`. Additionally, the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is either not equal to 1 or the length of the set of characters in `last_row` is not equal to 1, or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.
