Reasoning:
The provided solution checks whether the first and last rows of the grid are uniform and distinct from each other. If they are, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to make all squares the same color under the given operations. Otherwise, it prints "YES". However, this logic is flawed. Here's why:

1. **Flawed Logic**: The logic only checks the first and last rows. It assumes that if the first and last rows are uniform and different, it's impossible to make all squares the same color. This is not true. The operations allow changing any subrectangle of the same color, not just the first and last rows.

2. **Correct Approach**: To correctly solve this problem, we need to check if there exists at least one row or column that is uniform (all 'W' or all 'B'). If such a row or column exists, we can use the operations to make all squares the same color by repeatedly applying the operations to align the entire grid with that uniform row or column.

3. **Correct Solution**: The correct approach would involve checking each row and each column to see if it is uniform. If any row or column is uniform, the answer is "YES". If no uniform row or column exists, the answer is "NO".

Given the provided code, it incorrectly assumes that checking the first and last rows is sufficient, which leads to incorrect results for many cases.

Correctness: **False**

To fix the solution, the code should be revised to check each row and each column for uniformity before making the decision.
