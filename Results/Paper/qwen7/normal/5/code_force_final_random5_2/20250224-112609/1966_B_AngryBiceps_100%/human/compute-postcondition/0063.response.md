Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is an empty list, `first_row` is an empty string.**

The code `first_row = ''` assigns an empty string to the variable `first_row`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `m`, or `a`. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.
