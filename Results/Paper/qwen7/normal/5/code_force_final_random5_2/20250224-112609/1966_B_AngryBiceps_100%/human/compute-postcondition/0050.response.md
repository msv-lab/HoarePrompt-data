Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n-1`, where `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each being the corresponding input from the user.
- `first_row` is the concatenation of the first characters of all elements in the list `a`.
- `last_row` is the concatenation of the last characters of all elements in the list `a`.
- The first element of `a` consists of the same character.
- The last element of `a` consists of the same character.
- The first and last elements of `a` are different.

The `print('NO')` statement simply prints the string 'NO' to the console.
