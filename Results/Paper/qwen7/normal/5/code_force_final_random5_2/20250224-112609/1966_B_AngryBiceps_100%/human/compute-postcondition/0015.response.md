Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a valid integer, `a` is a list containing three elements where the first element is `first_row + a[-1][0]`, the second element is the input from the user, and the third element is the input from the user, `last_row` is equal to the last element of the last element of `a` plus the last element of the last element of `a` plus `a[-1][-1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `first_row` by adding `a[-1][0]` to its current value. The other variables and their relationships remain unchanged. Therefore, `first_row` is now updated to `first_row + a[-1][0]`, while `i`, `n`, and the structure of `a` (with the updated `first_row`) are preserved.
