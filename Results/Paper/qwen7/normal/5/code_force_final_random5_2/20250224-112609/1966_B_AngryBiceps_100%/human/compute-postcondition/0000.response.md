Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved here is the input value obtained from `int(input())`, which determines how many times the loop will run.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments Needed:**
   - The loop will execute based on the number of test cases, which is determined by the input.
   - We need to ensure that the input value is within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since the loop will run for each test case, the input value must be valid for the loop to execute correctly.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that the input value is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value, which determines the number of iterations of the loop.

**State:**
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

So, the final answer is:
**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**.
