Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a valid integer, `a` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `first_row` and the second element is the input from the user, `first_row` is equal to the first element of the only element in the list `a`, `last_row` is the last element of the last element of `a` plus the last element of the last element of `a`.**

Explanation: The code appends the input from the user to the list `a`. Initially, `a` contains one element which is the input from the user, and `first_row` is equal to the first element of the only element in the list `a`. After appending, `a` now contains two elements: the first element remains the same (which is `first_row`), and the second element is the new input from the user. The value of `last_row` is calculated as the last element of the last element of `a` plus the last element of the last element of `a`, which is the same as twice the last element of the last element of `a`.
