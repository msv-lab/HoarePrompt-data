Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `n` will be a valid integer, `a` will be a list containing `n` elements, each being the input received during the corresponding iteration of the loop. The variable `first_row` will be a string consisting of the first character of each string in the list `a`. The variable `last_row` will be a string consisting of the last character of each string in the list `a`, repeated twice for each element in `a`.

In more detail:
- `i` will be `n-1` because the loop increments `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
- `n` remains unchanged as it is determined before the loop starts.
- `a` will contain exactly `n` elements, with each element being the input provided on each iteration.
- `first_row` will concatenate the first character of each string in `a`.
- `last_row` will concatenate the last character of each string in `a`, and each character will appear twice in `last_row`.
