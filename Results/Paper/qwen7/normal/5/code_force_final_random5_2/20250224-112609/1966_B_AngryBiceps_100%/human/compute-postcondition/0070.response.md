Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list containing two elements where the first element is the original input and the second element is the new input from the user, `first_row` is the first element of the original input, `last_row` is the last element of the new input.**

Explanation: The code `a.append(input())` appends a new input value to the list `a`. Initially, `a` contains one element which is the first input from the user. After appending, `a` now contains two elements: the original input and the new input. The variables `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and `first_row` and `last_row` are updated based on the current state of `a`.
