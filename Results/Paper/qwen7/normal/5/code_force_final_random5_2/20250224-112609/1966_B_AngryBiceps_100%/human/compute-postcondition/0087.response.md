Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `n-1`, where `n` is greater than 0.
- `a` is a list containing `n` elements, each being the input from the user.
- `first_row` is the sum of the first elements of all sublists in `a`.
- `last_row` is the sum of the last elements of all sublists in `a`.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row`.

Output: **YES**
