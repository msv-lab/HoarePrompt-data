Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a valid integer, `a` is a list containing two elements where the first element is `first_row` and the second element is the input from the user, `first_row` is equal to `first_row + a[-1][0]`, `last_row` is equal to the last element of the last element of `a` plus the last element of the last element of `a` plus `a[-1][-1]`**.

Explanation:
- Initially, `i` is 1.
- `n` is a valid integer.
- `a` is a list containing two elements: the first element is `first_row` and the second element is the input from the user.
- `first_row` is equal to `first_row + a[-1][0]`.
- `last_row` is the last element of the last element of `a` plus the last element of the last element of `a`.

After executing the line `last_row += a[-1][-1]`:
- `last_row` is updated to be the last element of the last element of `a` plus the last element of the last element of `a` plus `a[-1][-1]`.
