Additionally, the first element of `a` and the last element of `a` either do not consist of a single unique character or they are the same. The length of the set of characters in `first_row` is not equal to 1, the length of the set of characters in `last_row` is not equal to 1, or the `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.**
