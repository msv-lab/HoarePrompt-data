Output State: **`ans` is the character corresponding to the value of `s[j] + 97` + 1, `j` is the first element of `array`, `array` is a non-empty list of integers.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `s[j]` by 1. Since `ans` was previously the character corresponding to the value of `s[j] + 97`, now `ans` corresponds to the character value of `s[j] + 98`. The value of `j` and the list `array` remain unchanged.
