Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for j in array`. The variables involved here are `j` and `array`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `ans` is a string where the last character is 'a', `s[j]` is incremented by 1 (meaning `s[j] = s[j] + 1`), and `s` and `j` retain their original values except `s[j]` which is incremented by 1.

3. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `j` must be within the bounds of `array`. Since `j` was used in the previous iteration, it means `j` is currently an index of `array`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - `j` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration because it is iterating through `array`.
   - `array` remains unchanged as it is the iterable itself and not modified within the loop.

5. **Formulate the new state**: Given that `j` is incremented by 1, the new value of `j` will be the next index in `array`. The state of `ans` and `s` does not change as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`ans` is a string where the last character is 'a', `s[j]` is `s[j] + 1`, `s` retains its original values, and `j` is incremented by 1**.

To express this clearly:

State: **`ans` is a string where the last character is 'a', `s[j+1]` is `s[j+1] + 1`, `s` retains its original values, and `j` is incremented by 1**.
