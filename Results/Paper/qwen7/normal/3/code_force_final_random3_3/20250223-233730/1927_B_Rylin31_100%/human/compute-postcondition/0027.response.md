Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `ans` is the original character plus the character corresponding to the second element of `array` in the list `s`, `array` is a non-empty list of integers, `s` is a list of `l` zeros where the second element of `array`-th element is now 2, `l` is an input integer, `j` is the second element of `array`**.

Explanation: The code `s[j] += 1` increments the value at index `j` in the list `s` by 1. Since `j` is the second element of `array`, and initially, the second element of `array`-th element in `s` was 1 (as per the initial state), after executing the code, the value at `s[j]` becomes 2. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
