Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in array:`. The variables involved here are `j` and `array`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `k + 1`
   - `ans` is the original character plus the character corresponding to the second element of `array` in the list `s`
   - `array` is a non-empty list of integers
   - `s` is a list of `l` zeros where the second element of `array`-th element is now 2
   - `l` is an input integer
   - `j` is the second element of `array`

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `array` to iterate over.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was set to the second element of `array`.
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be set to the next element in `array`.
   - Since `array` is a non-empty list, the next element exists, and `j` will be incremented to the next value in `array`.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `ans` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `array` is still a non-empty list of integers.
   - `s` is still a list of `l` zeros where the second element of `array`-th element is now 2.
   - `j` will be updated to the next element in `array`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `ans` is the original character plus the character corresponding to the second element of `array` in the list `s`, `array` is a non-empty list of integers, `s` is a list of `l` zeros where the second element of `array`-th element is now 2, `l` is an input integer, `j` is the next element in `array`**
