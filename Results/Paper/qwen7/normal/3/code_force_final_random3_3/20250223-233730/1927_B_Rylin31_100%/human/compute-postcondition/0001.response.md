Output State: **`i` is 0, `l` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The variable `i` retains its initial value of 0. The variable `l` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it takes an integer input from the user. The precondition that `t` must be a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) is still valid, but since no input has been provided yet, `t` is not directly referenced in the current state.
