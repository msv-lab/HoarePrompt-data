Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `ans` is a string containing the character corresponding to the index `j` in the list `s` (which is a list of `l` zeros), `array` is a non-empty list of integers, `s` is a list of `l` zeros, `l` is an input integer, `j` is the first element of `array`**.

Explanation: The code appends to the string `ans` the character whose ASCII value is `s[j] + 97`. Since `s` is a list of `l` zeros, `s[j]` is `0`. Therefore, the character appended to `ans` is `chr(0 + 97)`, which is `chr(97)`, the character 'a'. The values of `i`, `array`, `s`, `l`, and `j` remain unchanged.
