Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in array`. The variables involved here are `j` and `array`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `ans` is a string where the last character is 'b'.
   - `s[j+1]` is `s[j+1] + 1`.
   - `s` retains its original values.
   - `j` is incremented by 1.
   - `s[j]` is `s[j] + 1`.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `array`, the variable `j` is being incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` must be within the bounds of `array`.

Given that `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, and assuming `j` started from an initial value (let's call it `initial_j`), the new value of `j` will be `initial_j + 1`.

Since the exact initial value of `j` is not specified, we can denote it as `initial_j`. After one iteration, `j` becomes `initial_j + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - `ans` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `s` retains its original values.
   - `j` is now `initial_j + 1`.
   - `s[j]` is updated to `s[j] + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`ans` is a string where the last character is 'b', `s[j+1]` is `s[j+1] + 1`, `s` retains its original values, `j` is `initial_j + 1`, and `s[j]` is `s[j] + 1**.
