Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `ans` is a string consisting of characters corresponding to the values of `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in `array`, where `s[j]` has been incremented by 1 for each iteration involving `j`, `array` remains a non-empty list of integers, `s` is a list of integers, `l` is an input integer.**

The code `l = int(input())` assigns the value of the integer input to the variable `l`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
