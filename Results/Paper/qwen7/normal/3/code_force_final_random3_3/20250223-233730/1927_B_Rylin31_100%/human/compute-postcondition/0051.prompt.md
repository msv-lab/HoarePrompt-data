Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the second line contains n non-negative integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n such that 0 ≤ a_i < n.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    l = int(input())
    s = [(0) for i in range(l)]
    array = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = ''
    for j in array:
        ans += chr(s[j] + 97)
        s[j] += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `ans` is a string consisting of characters corresponding to the values of `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in `array`, where `s[j]` has been incremented by 1 for each iteration involving `j`. `j` takes on each value in `array` exactly once, and `array` remains a non-empty list of integers. The list `s` will have its elements at the indices specified by `array` incremented by the number of times their index was encountered in `array`.

To summarize, `ans` will be a concatenated string of characters derived from the modified list `s` based on the indices provided in `array`, with each character being the result of `s[j] + 97` where `j` is an element of `array`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `k + 1`, `ans` is a string containing the characters corresponding to each element in `array` in the list `s` with their respective counts, `array` is a non-empty list of integers, `s` is a list of `l` zeros where each element in `array`-th position is incremented by its respective count, `l` is an input integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The final value of `ans` is a string where the last character is 'c', `s[j]` is incremented by 3 for the last executed index `j`, and all other variables retain their original values.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
