Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `ans` is a string consisting of characters corresponding to the values of `s[j] + 97` for each `j` in `array`, `array` remains a non-empty list of integers, `s` is now a list of `l` zeros, `l` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code initializes the list `s` with `l` elements, each set to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
