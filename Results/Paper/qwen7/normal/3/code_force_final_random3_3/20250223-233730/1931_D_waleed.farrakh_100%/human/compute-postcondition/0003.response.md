Output State: **`t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer, `data` remains unchanged, `test_cases` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `test_cases`. This does not affect the values of `t` or `data`. Therefore, `t` remains the first element of `data` converted to an integer, and `data` remains unchanged.
