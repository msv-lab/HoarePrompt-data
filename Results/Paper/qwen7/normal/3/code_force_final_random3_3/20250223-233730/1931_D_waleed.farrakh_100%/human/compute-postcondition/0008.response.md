Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `n` is an integer from the split data; `x` is an integer from the split data; `y` is an integer from the split data; `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `data[idx + 1]` and converting each element to an integer; `test_cases` is a list that now includes a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`**.

In this output state, the `test_cases` list has been updated to include a new tuple containing the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`. All other variables retain their initial conditions.
