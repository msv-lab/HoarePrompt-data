Output State: **`results` contains the value of `count`, all other variables remain the same.**

Explanation: The line `results.append(count)` adds the current value of `count` to the list `results`. Since `results` was previously empty (as no elements have been appended before this line), now it contains exactly one element, which is the value of `count`. The values of `arr`, `rx`, `ry`, `freq`, and `count` remain unchanged from their previous states.
