Output State: **`arr` must contain at least one element; `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`; `count` remains unchanged if `(rx, ry)` is not in `freq`, otherwise `count` is increased by the size of the set `freq` containing the tuple `(rx, ry); `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is `a % y`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the tuple `(a % x, a % y)` to the variable `current_pair`. The values of `arr`, `count`, `freq`, `rx`, and `ry` remain unchanged from their previous states. The new value of `rx` is calculated as `(-a % x + x) % x`, and the new value of `ry` is calculated as `a % y`.
