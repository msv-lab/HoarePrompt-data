You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n (an integer representing the size of the array), x and y (two integers representing Polycarp's favorite integers), and arr (a list of n integers representing the elements of the array). Each element in arr is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        freq = {}
        
        count = 0
        
        for a in arr:
            rx = (-a % x + x) % x
            ry = a % y
            if (rx, ry) in freq:
                count += freq[rx, ry]
            current_pair = a % x, a % y
            if current_pair in freq:
                freq[current_pair] += 1
            else:
                freq[current_pair] = 1
        
        results.append(count)
        
    #State: `results` is a list containing the cumulative sum of `count` values computed over all iterations of the loop. The variable `freq` retains its final state from the last iteration, while `rx`, `ry`, `count`, and `current_pair` also reflect their final values from the last iteration.
    return results
    #The program returns a list named 'results' which contains the cumulative sum of 'count' values computed over all iterations of the loop. Additionally, the list includes the final states of 'freq', 'rx', 'ry', and 'current_pair' from the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter test_cases, which is a list of tuples containing n, x, y, and arr. It processes each tuple to compute count values and returns a list of cumulative sums of these counts along with the final states of freq, rx, ry, and current_pair.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list named 'results' which contains the cumulative sum of 'count' values computed over all iterations of the loop. Additionally, the list includes the final states of 'freq', 'rx', 'ry', and 'current_pair' from the last iteration.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
