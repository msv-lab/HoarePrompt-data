Output State: **`results` now contains the value of `count`, `current_pair`, `rx`, `ry`, `count`, and `freq` remains an empty dictionary.**

Explanation: The line `freq = {}` initializes an empty dictionary named `freq`. This does not affect the values of `count`, `current_pair`, `rx`, `ry`, `count`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, and `test_cases`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and only `freq` is updated to an empty dictionary.
