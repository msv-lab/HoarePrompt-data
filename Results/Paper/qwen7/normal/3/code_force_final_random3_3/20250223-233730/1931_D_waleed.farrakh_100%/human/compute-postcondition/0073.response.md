Output State: **`arr` contains all elements except the current `a`, `current_pair` is `((next_a % x), a % y)`, `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is `a % y`, `count` remains unchanged, and `freq[current_pair]` is either incremented by 1 or set to 1 depending on whether `current_pair` was already present in `freq`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ry` to `a % y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
