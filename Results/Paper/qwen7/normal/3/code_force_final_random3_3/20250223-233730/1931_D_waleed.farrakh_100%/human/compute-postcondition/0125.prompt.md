Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n (an integer representing the size of the array), x and y (two integers representing Polycarp's favorite integers), and arr (a list of n integers representing the elements of the array). Each element in arr is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive; `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for n, x, y, arr in test_cases:
    freq = {}
    count = 0
    for a in arr:
        rx = (-a % x + x) % x
        ry = a % y
        if (rx, ry) in freq:
            count += freq[rx, ry]
        current_pair = a % x, a % y
        if current_pair in freq:
            freq[current_pair] += 1
        else:
            freq[current_pair] = 1
    results.append(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `results` contains the value of `count`, all other variables remain the same.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `results` now contains the value of `count`, all other variables (`current_pair`, `rx`, `ry`, `count`, and `freq`) remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `results` list now contains the value of `count`, which was the sum of all values in `freq` for each unique pair `(a % x, a % y)`. The variables `freq`, `rx`, `ry`, and `current_pair` retain their values from the last iteration of the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
