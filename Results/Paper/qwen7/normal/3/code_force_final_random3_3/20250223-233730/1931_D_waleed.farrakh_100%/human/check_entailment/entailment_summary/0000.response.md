Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Reads input from standard input and processes it to form test cases.
   - Each test case consists of an integer \( n \), two integers \( x \) and \( y \), and a list of \( n \) integers \( arr \).
   - It then passes these test cases to `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Accepts a list of test cases.
   - For each test case, it calculates the count of beautiful pairs using the conditions specified in the problem statement.
   - It uses a frequency dictionary to keep track of the occurrences of pairs \((a \% x, a \% y)\).
   - It correctly iterates through the array and updates the frequency dictionary and the count of beautiful pairs.

3. **Problem Description**:
   - The problem requires finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array based on the given conditions.
   - A pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is considered beautiful if \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

4. **Verification**:
   - Both functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) are designed to solve the problem correctly according to the provided problem description.
   - `func_2` reads the input and passes it to `func_1`.
   - `func_1` processes each test case and calculates the required count of beautiful pairs accurately.

Given that both functions work as intended and correctly implement the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
