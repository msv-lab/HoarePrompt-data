### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to verify its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `results` is initialized as an empty list.
   - `freq` is initialized as an empty dictionary to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(a % x, a % y)`.

2. **Loop through the array**:
   - For each element `a` in the array `arr`, compute `rx` and `ry`:
     - `rx = (-a % x + x) % x`: This ensures that `rx` is always non-negative.
     - `ry = a % y`: This directly computes the remainder when `a` is divided by `y`.

3. **Check and update the frequency dictionary**:
   - If the pair `(rx, ry)` already exists in `freq`, add its count to `count`.
   - Update the frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` in `freq`.

4. **Store the result**:
   - Append the count of beautiful pairs to `results`.

5. **Return the results**:
   - Return the list `results` containing the counts of beautiful pairs for each test case.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Reading input**:
   - Read the entire input from standard input and split it into lines.
   - Extract the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`, and store them in `test_cases`.

2. **Process each test case**:
   - Call `func_1` with the list of test cases.
   - Print the results returned by `func_1`.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program at various points, ensuring that the logic is followed accurately.
- The program correctly handles the modulo operations to ensure non-negative remainders.
- The frequency dictionary `freq` is used effectively to count the occurrences of each pair `(a % x, a % y)`.
- The logic for counting beautiful pairs is sound and follows the problem description.

#### Edge Cases:
- The program handles large inputs efficiently due to the use of dictionaries for frequency counting.
- The modulo operations ensure that the remainders are always within the valid range.
- The program correctly processes multiple test cases and outputs the results as expected.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where the program fails to meet the requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the examples.
