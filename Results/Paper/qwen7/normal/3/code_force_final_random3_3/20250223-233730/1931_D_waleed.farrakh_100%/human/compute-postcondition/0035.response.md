Output State: **`a` is the next element in `arr`, `rx` is (-a % x + x) % x, `ry` is a % y, `count` is increased by freq[current_pair] + 1, `current_pair` is (a % x, a % y), `ry` is updated to a % y, `count` is either count + freq[(rx, ry)] if (rx, ry) is in freq, or just count + 1 if (rx, ry) is not in freq.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `a % x, a % y` to `current_pair`. This does not change the values of `a`, `x`, `y`, `rx`, `ry`, `count`, `freq`, or `current_pair` directly, but it updates `current_pair` to the new values of `a % x` and `a % y`. The other variables remain in their previously described states.
