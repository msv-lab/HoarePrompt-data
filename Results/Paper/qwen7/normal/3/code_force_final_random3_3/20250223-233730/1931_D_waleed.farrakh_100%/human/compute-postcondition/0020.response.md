Output State: `t` is 0, `data` remains unchanged, `test_cases` is a list containing tuples `(n, x, y, arr)` for each iteration where `n`, `x`, `y` are integers obtained from the split data, and `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `data[idx + 1]` and converting each element to an integer; `idx` is increased by twice the number of iterations which equals `2 * t`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` (which represents the number of times the loop runs) becomes 0 because `t` is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The `data` list remains unchanged as no modifications were made to it within the loop. The `test_cases` list accumulates tuples `(n, x, y, arr)` for each iteration, where `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers derived from the split data, and `arr` is a list of integers obtained by further splitting `data[idx + 1]`. The `idx` variable is incremented by 2 for each iteration, so its final value is `2 * t`.
