Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `idx` is `idx + 2`, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `data[idx + 1]` on spaces and converting each substring to an integer, `test_cases` is a list containing a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`**.

Explanation: The variable `idx` is incremented by 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
