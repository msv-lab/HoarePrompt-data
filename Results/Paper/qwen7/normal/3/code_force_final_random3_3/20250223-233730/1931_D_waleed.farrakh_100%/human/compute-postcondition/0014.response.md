Output State: **`idx` is increased by 4; `t` is decreased by 1; `n` is the integer value of the first part of `data[idx - 2]` split by spaces; `x` is the integer value of the second part of `data[idx - 2]` split by spaces; `y` is the integer value of the third part of `data[idx - 2]` split by spaces; `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `data[idx - 1]` and converting each element to an integer; `test_cases` is a list that now includes a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`**.

Explanation: The code `idx += 2` increases the value of `idx` by 2. Therefore, `idx` is now increased by 4 from its initial state (increased by 2). The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` remain unchanged because they depend on the value of `data[idx]` and `data[idx + 1]`, which are now `data[idx - 2]` and `data[idx - 1]` respectively. The `test_cases` list now includes a new tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` derived from the updated value of `idx`.
