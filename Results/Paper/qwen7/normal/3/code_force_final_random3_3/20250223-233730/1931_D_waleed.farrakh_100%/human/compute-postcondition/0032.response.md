Output State: **`a` is the next element in `arr`, `rx` is (-a % x + x) % x, `ry` is a % y, `count` is increased by freq[current_pair] + 1, `current_pair` is (a % x, a % y), if current_pair is in freq, freq[current_pair] is incremented by 1. Otherwise, freq[current_pair] is set to 1, `ry` is updated to a % y, `count` is count + freq[(rx, ry)]**.

Explanation: The code `count += freq[rx, ry]` increments the `count` variable by the value of `freq[rx, ry]`. All other variables (`a`, `rx`, `ry`, `current_pair`, `freq`) remain unchanged from their previous states. The `ry` variable is also updated to `a % y`, which was already part of the initial state.
