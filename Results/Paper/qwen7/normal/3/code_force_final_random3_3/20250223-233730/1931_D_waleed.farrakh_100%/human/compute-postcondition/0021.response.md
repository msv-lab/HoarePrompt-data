Output State: `idx` is equal to `t * 2`, `t` is equal to 0, `data` remains unchanged, `test_cases` is a list containing tuples `(n, x, y, arr)` for each iteration of the loop, where `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers obtained from the split data, and `arr` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `data[idx + 1]` and converting each element to an integer.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `idx` will be twice the original value of `t`, `t` will be reduced to 0 (since it decreases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0), `data` will remain unchanged, and `test_cases` will contain a tuple for each iteration of the loop, with each tuple consisting of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.
