Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over the range from `mdx` to `n`. This means `i` starts from `mdx` and increments until it reaches `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`.
   - `n` is an integer greater than `mdx` and not equal to 1.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `res` is 1.
   - `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
   - The middle index `mdx` of the list `a` has the same value as the index `i`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented at each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was at `mdx`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `mdx + 1`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `total` remains greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`.
   - `n` remains an integer greater than `mdx` and not equal to 1.
   - `a` remains a sorted list of integers.
   - `res` remains 1.
   - `mdx` remains `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
   - The middle index `mdx` of the list `a` still has the same value as the index `i`, but now `i` will be `mdx + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`total` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an integer greater than `mdx` and not equal to 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `res` is 1, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, and the middle index `mdx` of the list `a` has the same value as the index `i + 1`**.
