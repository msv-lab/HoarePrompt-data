Output State: **`res` is 2, `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 1`, `t` is equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer that must satisfy `mdx < n`, `a` is a sorted list of integers.**

Explanation: The code `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. Since `res` was initially 1, after this line, `res` becomes 2. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `mdx`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
