Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`. This creates a contradiction because if `t` is greater than 0, it cannot be equal to `t - 1` unless `t` is 1. However, since `t` is explicitly stated to be greater than 0, we must assume `t` is 1 (the smallest positive integer).
   - `n` equals 1.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string. Since no specific input string is provided, we cannot determine the exact content of `a`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code snippet contains only one line: `print(1)`.
   - This line directly prints the integer `1`.

Given this analysis, the output is straightforward.

Output: **1**
