Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`. This implies that `t` must be 1 because if `t` were any other number, it wouldn't satisfy both conditions simultaneously. Therefore, `t = 1`.
   - `n` is an input integer. Its value is not specified, so we'll keep it as `n`.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string. Since the value of `a` is not explicitly defined, we cannot determine its contents, but we know it is sorted.

2. **Code Snippet Execution**:
   - The code snippet contains only one line: `print(1)`. This line will print the integer `1`.

Based on the above analysis, the output of the code snippet is simply the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
