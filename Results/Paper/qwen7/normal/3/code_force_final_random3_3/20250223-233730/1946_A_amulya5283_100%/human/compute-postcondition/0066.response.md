Output State: **`res` is 1, `t` is equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer that must satisfy `mdx < n`, `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user split from a single input string and converted to integers using map(int, input().split()), `res` is 0, `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, the middle index `mdx` of list `a` is equal to index `i`, and `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`.**

Explanation: The line `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. Since `res` was initially 0, it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
