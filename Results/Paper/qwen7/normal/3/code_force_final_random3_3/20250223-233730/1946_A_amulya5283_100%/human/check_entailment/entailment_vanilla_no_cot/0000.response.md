Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The logic in the `for` loop is flawed. Specifically, the code is counting the number of elements equal to the current median, which is not what is needed. Instead, the solution should determine how many operations are needed to make the median greater than its current value.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        t -= 1
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            mdx = n // 2
            median = a[mdx]
            res = 0
            for i in range(n):
                if a[i] <= median:
                    res += median - a[i] + 1
                else:
                    break
            print(res)
```

This corrected version calculates the number of operations needed to make the median greater than its current value by iterating through the array and accumulating the necessary operations.
