Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each case, it reads a positive integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers \( a \). It then sorts the list \( a \) and calculates the count of consecutive occurrences of the middle element (if \( n \) is odd) or the second middle element (if \( n \) is even) from the middle index towards the end of the list. Finally, it prints the count for each test case.**
