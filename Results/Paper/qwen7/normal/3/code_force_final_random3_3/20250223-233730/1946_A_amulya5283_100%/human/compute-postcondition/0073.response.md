Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `mdx`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `mdx` to `n-1`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is equal to `t - 1`
   - `n` is an input integer that must satisfy `mdx < n`
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers
   - `res` is 2
   - `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`
   - `i` is `mdx + 1`

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at `mdx + 1` and the loop increments `i` in each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

Given the current state:
- `i` is `mdx + 1`
- `n` must be greater than `mdx`

For the next iteration:
- `i` will be `mdx + 2`
- `n` must remain the same and still satisfy `mdx < n`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer that must satisfy `mdx < n`, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `res` is 2, `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 2`**
