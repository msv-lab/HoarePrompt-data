Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t)`. The variables involved here are `t`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postconditions are:
   - `i` is `n + 1`
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `possible` is `True` if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` or `c[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `possible` is `False`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop `for _ in range(t)` will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is decremented by 1 for the next iteration to allow the loop to continue.
   - The values of `i`, `n`, and `possible` remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body, but since no such modifications are mentioned, they stay the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `i` remains `n + 1`
- `n` remains greater than 0
- `possible` remains as it was in the previous iteration (either `True` or `False` based on the conditions)

So, the updated state is:
State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is the same as the previous iteration, `t` is `t - 1`**
