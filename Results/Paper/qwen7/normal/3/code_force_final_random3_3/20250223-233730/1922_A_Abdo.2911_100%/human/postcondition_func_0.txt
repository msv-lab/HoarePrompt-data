The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads integers t and n, and strings a, b, and c. It then checks if it's possible to transform string c into either string a or b by changing one character at a time. If such a transformation is possible, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
