Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is `True`, `b` is the stripped input string, `c` is the stripped input string, the current value of `a[i]` is not equal to the current value of `c[i]' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement. Therefore, the values of `i`, `n`, `possible`, `b`, `c`, and the condition involving `a[i]` and `c[i]` remain unchanged.
