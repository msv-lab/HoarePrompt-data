Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is `False`, `b` is the stripped input string, `c` is the stripped input string, and the current value of `c[i]` is either equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the flow of execution to jump back to the start of the loop (if there is one), without executing the remaining part of the current iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables within the scope of the `continue` statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial or previous states.
