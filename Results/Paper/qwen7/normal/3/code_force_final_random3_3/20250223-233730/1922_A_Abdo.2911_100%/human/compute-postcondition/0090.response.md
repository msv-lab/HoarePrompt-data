Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` remains `False`, and we continue out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop and moves to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables within the scope of the `continue` statement, the values of `i`, `n`, and `possible` remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition for breaking out of the loop or if statement due to the `possible` variable's state does not apply here because the `continue` statement does not evaluate any conditions.
