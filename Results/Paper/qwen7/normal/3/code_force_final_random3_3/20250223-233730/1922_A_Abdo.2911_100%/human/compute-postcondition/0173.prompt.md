Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = input().strip()
    b = input().strip()
    c = input().strip()
    possible = False
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == b[i]:
            if c[i] != a[i]:
                possible = True
                break
        elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
            continue
        else:
            possible = True
            break
    if possible:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is a positive integer, and `possible` remains `False` unless there was a condition inside the loop that made `possible` turn `True` for any index `i` from `0` to `n-1`. In that case, `possible` would be `True`. The if condition checks whether `possible` is `True`, and if so, the state remains the same as the precondition. If `possible` is `False`, the state also remains the same as the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `possible` is `True` if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` or `c[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `possible` is `False`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: i is n, n is greater than 0, and `possible` is either True or False.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
