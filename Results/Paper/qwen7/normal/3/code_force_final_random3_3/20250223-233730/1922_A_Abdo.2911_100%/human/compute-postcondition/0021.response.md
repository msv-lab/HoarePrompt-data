Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, and the elements at index `i` of arrays `a` and `b` are not equal, and `c[i]` is neither equal to `a[i]` nor `b[i]`; `possible` is True.**

Explanation: The line `possible = True` sets the variable `possible` to `True`. This does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, or `c`. Therefore, the conditions related to these variables remain unchanged.
