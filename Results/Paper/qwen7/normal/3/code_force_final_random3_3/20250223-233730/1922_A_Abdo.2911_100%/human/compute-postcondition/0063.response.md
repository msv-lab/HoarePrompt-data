Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `possible` remains `False`, `b` is the stripped input string, `c` is the stripped input string.**

Explanation: The code `c = input().strip()` takes an input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and assigns the result to `c`. The values of `i`, `n`, `possible`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
