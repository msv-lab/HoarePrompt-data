Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, and the value of `a[0]` is equal to the value of `b[0]`. The current value of `c[0]` is not equal to the value of `a[0]`. `possible` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Since no variables are modified by this statement, all the previous conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the original conditions plus the fact that we have broken out of the loop or conditional block.
