Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` must be greater than 0; `possible` is True**

Explanation: The variable `possible` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still 1, and `n` must still be greater than 0. The new state includes the assignment of `True` to `possible`.
