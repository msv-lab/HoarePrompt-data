Postcondition: **`i` is equal to `n`, `n` is a positive integer, and `possible` remains `False` unless there was a condition inside the loop that made `possible` turn `True` for any index `i` from `0` to `n-1`. In that case, `possible` would be `True`. The if condition checks whether `possible` is `True`, and if so, the state remains the same as the precondition. If `possible` is `False`, the state also remains the same as the precondition.**
