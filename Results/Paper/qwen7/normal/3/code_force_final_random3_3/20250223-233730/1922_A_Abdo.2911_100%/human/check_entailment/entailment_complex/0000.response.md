Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and for each test case, it reads the length of the strings (`n`) and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Validation Logic**:
   - The program iterates over each character position `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - It checks if the characters at the same position in strings `a` and `b` are the same.
     - If they are the same and the character at the same position in `c` is different, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the characters in `a` and `b` at position `i` are different, it checks if the character in `c` matches either `a[i]` or `b[i]`. If it does, it continues to the next character; otherwise, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
   - After checking all positions, if `possible` is still `False`, it means no valid template exists, and it prints 'NO'.

3. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints 'YES' if a valid template exists and 'NO' otherwise.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
