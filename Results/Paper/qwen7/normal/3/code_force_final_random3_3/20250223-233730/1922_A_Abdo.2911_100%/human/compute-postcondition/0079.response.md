Output State: **`possible` is `True`, `b` is the stripped input string, `c` is the stripped input string, and `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`.**

Explanation: The line `possible = True` sets the variable `possible` to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
