Based on the initial state provided:

- `k` is `k - 2`
- `x` is `x + 1`
- `a` remains unchanged
- `z` is updated based on the formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` for `x - k + 3` times

The print statement is simply `print('YES')`.

Since the print statement directly outputs the string `'YES'` without referencing any variables or objects whose values need to be determined, the output will be exactly as printed.

Output: **YES**
