Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the expression `x - k + 3`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < x - k + 3`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `k` is an integer equal to the first number in the string `s`.
   - `x` is an integer equal to the second number in the string `s`, and `x` must be greater than `k - 3`.
   - `a` is an integer equal to the third number in the string `s`.
   - `s` is the second line of the input (a string).
   - `z` is updated by the formula `z = k - 2 + z // (k - 1) + 1`, and then further updated by `z += z // (k - 1) + 1`.

4. **Calculate the initial value of the loop condition**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, let's assume `i` was `i_end` and the loop just finished its execution.
   - Therefore, the loop condition was `i_end < x - k + 3`.

5. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` will be `i_end + 1`.
   - The condition `i < x - k + 3` must still hold true, so the new condition becomes `(i_end + 1) < x - k + 3`.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - The only variables that need to be adjusted are `i` and the loop condition `x - k + 3`.
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` is `i_end + 1`.
   - The loop condition remains the same, but it needs to be evaluated with the new value of `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`k` is an integer equal to the first number in the string `s`, `x` is an integer equal to the second number in the string `s`, and `x` must be greater than `k - 3`, `a` is an integer equal to the third number in the string `s`, `s` is the second line of the input (a string), `z` is updated by the formula `z = k - 2 + z // (k - 1) + 1`, and then further updated by `z += z // (k - 1) + 1`, `i` is `i_end + 1`, and the loop condition `x - k + 3` remains unchanged.**

However, since we only need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, the final answer is:

State: **`i` is `i_end + 1`, `x` must be greater than `k - 3`**.
