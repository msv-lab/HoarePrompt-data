Postcondition: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers. If `x` equals `k - 1`, no changes are made to `k`, `x`, and `a`. Otherwise, `k` is decreased by 2, `x` is greater than `k - 3`, `a` remains unchanged, `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1` a total of `x - k + 3` times, and `z` becomes the initial value of `z` plus the sum of `z // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration.**
