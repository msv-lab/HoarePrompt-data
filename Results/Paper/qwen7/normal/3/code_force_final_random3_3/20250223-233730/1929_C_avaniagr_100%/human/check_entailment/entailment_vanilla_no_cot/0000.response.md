Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Conditions**: The conditions in the `if-elif-else` block do not correctly handle all scenarios. Specifically, the logic for determining if Sasha can achieve his goal needs to be more robust.

2. **Calculation of `z`**: The calculation of `z` is flawed. It should account for the fact that Sasha can potentially recover from losses within the limit of `x` consecutive losses.

3. **Strategy for Winning**: The strategy for ensuring Sasha can achieve any number of coins is not fully implemented. The current logic does not correctly simulate the betting strategy needed to ensure Sasha can eventually have any number of coins.

### Corrected Solution:
Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (k, x, a) = map(int, s.split())
        
        # If Sasha can't recover from x consecutive losses, he can't guarantee winning
        if a < x + 1:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        # If Sasha can recover from x consecutive losses, he can guarantee winning
        if x <= k - 2:
            print('YES')
            continue
        
        # For the case where x > k - 2, Sasha needs to check if he can recover from losses
        z = a
        for _ in range(x):
            z = z * (k - 1) + 1
        if z >= a:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Solution:
1. **Initial Check**: If Sasha's initial coins (`a`) are less than `x + 1`, he cannot guarantee winning because he might run out of coins before recovering from losses.
2. **Recovery Check**: If `x` is less than or equal to `k - 2`, Sasha can always recover from losses because he can bet a fraction of his coins each time without running out.
3. **Detailed Recovery Calculation**: For the case where `x` is greater than `k - 2`, we simulate the recovery process by calculating how many coins Sasha would have after `x` consecutive losses. If he can recover, he can guarantee winning.

This approach ensures that the solution correctly handles all edge cases and provides the right output based on the given constraints.
