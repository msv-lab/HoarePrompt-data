Postcondition: `k` is an integer equal to the first number in the string `s`, `x` is an integer equal to the second number in the string `s`, `a` is an integer equal to the third number in the string `s`, `s` is the second line of the input (a string). If `x` is exactly equal to `k - 1` and `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`, then `a` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `a` is less than or equal to `x + 1`. If `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, then `x` is greater than `k - 3`, and `z` is the initial value `k - 2` plus the sum of `z // (k - 1) + 1` added `x - k + 3` times.
