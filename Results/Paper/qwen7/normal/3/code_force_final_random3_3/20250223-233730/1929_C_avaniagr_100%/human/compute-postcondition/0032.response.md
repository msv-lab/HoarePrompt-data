Output State: **`i` is `i_end + 1`, `x` must be greater than `k - 3`, `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1`**

Explanation: The variable `z` is updated by adding the value of `z // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `z`, we only know that `z` has been updated by this expression. The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
