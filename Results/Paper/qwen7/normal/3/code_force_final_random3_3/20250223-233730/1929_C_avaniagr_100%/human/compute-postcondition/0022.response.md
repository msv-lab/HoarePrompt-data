Postcondition: `k` is an integer equal to the first number in the string `s`, `x` is an integer equal to the second number in the string `s`, `a` is an integer equal to the third number in the string `s`, `s` is the second line of the input (a string), and `x` is exactly equal to `k - 1`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`, then `a` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `a` is less than or equal to `x + 1`.
