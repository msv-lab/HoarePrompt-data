Output State: **`k` is the first value of `s` split and converted to int, `x` is the second value of `s` split and converted to int, `a` is the third value of `s` split and converted to int**.

Given the initial state where `k` is 5, `x` is 2, and `a` is 4, the code `k, x, a = map(int, s.split())` will assign the values from the string `s` split by spaces to `k`, `x`, and `a`. Since the initial values of `k`, `x`, and `a` are provided but the string `s` is not specified, the output state reflects that `k`, `x`, and `a` are now the values from `s` split and converted to integers.
