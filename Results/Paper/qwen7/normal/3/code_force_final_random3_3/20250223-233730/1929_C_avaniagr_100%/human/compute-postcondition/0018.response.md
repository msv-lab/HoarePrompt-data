Based on the initial state provided:

- `k` is an integer equal to the first number in the string `s`.
- `x` is an integer equal to the second number in the string `s`.
- `a` is an integer equal to the third number in the string `s`.
- `s` is the second line of the input (a string).
- `x` is exactly equal to `k - 1`.
- The current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`.

The print statement is:
```python
print('YES')
```

This print statement will output the string 'YES' directly, regardless of the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.

Output: **YES**
