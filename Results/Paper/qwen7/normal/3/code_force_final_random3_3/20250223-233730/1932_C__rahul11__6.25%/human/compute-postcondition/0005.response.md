Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer input within this range, `m` is the second integer input within this range, `arr` is a list of integers created from the input split, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string, `res` is a list of n zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `res` with `n` zeros. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `arr`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial state. After executing the line `res = [0] * n`, `res` is a list containing `n` elements, each set to 0.
