Output State: **`c` is increased by 1, `ans` is `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `k` is `k + 1`, and `n` must be greater than `k + 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `res[c]` to be the result of `ans % m % MOD`. The values of `c`, `ans`, `res`, `k`, and `n` are updated according to their previous states. Specifically, `c` is increased by 1, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, and `res[c]` is set to the new value of `ans % m % MOD`. The conditions on `k` and `n` remain unchanged.
