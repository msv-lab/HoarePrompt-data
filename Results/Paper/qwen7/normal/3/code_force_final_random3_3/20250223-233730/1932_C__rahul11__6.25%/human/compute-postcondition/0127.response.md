Output State: **`ans` is the value of `ans` after performing the operation `ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `res[c]` is the value of `ans % m % MOD`, `k` is an index within the string `s` with the character at index `k` being 'L', `l` is increased by 1, and `arr[l]` and `MOD` are unchanged from their previous values.**

Explanation: The line `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. All other variables remain in their previous states.
