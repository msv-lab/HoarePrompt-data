Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr`, `k` is `n-1`, `n` is an integer input by the user, `s` is a list of characters obtained from an input, `res` is a list of zeros with length `n`, `l` is 0, `r` is now `n-1`, `c` is equal to 1, `res[0]` is `ans % m % MOD
Code of the loop:
for k in range(n - 1):
    if s[k] == 'L':
        ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD
        res[c] = ans % m % MOD
        l += 1
    else:
        ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD
        res[c] = ans % m % MOD
        r -= 1
    c += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `c` is increased by 1, `ans` and `res[c]` are integers, `k` is an index within the string `s`, and `l` and `r` are indices related to the array operations. If the character at index `k` in string `s` is 'L', then `ans` is updated by dividing `ans` by `arr[l]` and taking modulo `MOD`, `res[c]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`, and `l` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `res[c]` remains as `ans % m % MOD`, `ans` is updated by performing `ans = ans // arr[r-1] % MOD`, and `k` is an index within the string `s` where the character is not 'L'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `c` is 2, `ans` is either the integer value of `ans` divided by `arr[l]` modulo `MOD` or `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `res[c]` is equal to `ans % m % MOD`, `k` is `n-1`, `l` is increased by 1 if the condition `s[k] == 'L'` is true, otherwise `r` is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `c` is 3, `ans` is either the integer value of `ans` divided by `arr[l+1]` modulo `MOD` or `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `res[c]` is equal to `ans % m % MOD`, `k` is `n-1`, `l` is incremented by 1, `r` is decreased by 1 if `s[k] != 'L'`, otherwise `l` remains unchanged and `r` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
