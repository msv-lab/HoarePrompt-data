Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Initialization of `ans`:**
   - The variable `ans` is initialized with the product of all elements in the array `arr`. However, this product can be very large, and taking the modulo twice (`ans % m % MOD`) is unnecessary and incorrect. Instead, you should initialize `ans` correctly and update it during the loop.

2. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The modulo operation should be applied after each multiplication to avoid overflow and ensure correctness. The current implementation takes the modulo twice, which is redundant and potentially incorrect.

3. **Loop Range:**
   - The loop runs `n-1` times, but the problem states that there are `n` commands. Therefore, the loop should run `n` times.

4. **Array Length Update:**
   - The lengths `l` and `r` should be updated correctly to reflect the removal of elements from the array. The current implementation does not correctly handle the removal of elements.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 6
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = list(input())
        res = [0] * n
        ans = 1
        for i in arr:
            ans = (ans * i) % m
        res[0] = ans
        for k in range(n):
            if s[k] == 'L':
                ans = (ans * pow(arr[k], -1, m)) % m
                res[k+1] = ans
            else:
                ans = (ans * pow(arr[n-1-k], -1, m)) % m
                res[k+1] = ans
            if k < n-1:
                if s[k] == 'L':
                    arr.pop(0)
                else:
                    arr.pop()
        print(*res)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the product is updated correctly with each command and handles the removal of elements properly.
