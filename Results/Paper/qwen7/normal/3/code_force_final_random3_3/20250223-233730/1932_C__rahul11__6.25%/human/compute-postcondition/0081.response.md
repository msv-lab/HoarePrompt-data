Postcondition: `ans` and `res[c]` are integers, `k` is an index within the string `s`, and `l` and `r` are indices related to the array operations. If the character at index `k` in string `s` is 'L', then `ans` is updated by dividing `ans` by `arr[l]` and taking modulo `MOD`, `res[c]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`, and `l` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `res[c]` remains as `ans % m % MOD`, `ans` is updated by performing `ans = ans // arr[r-1] % MOD`, and `k` is an index within the string `s` where the character is not 'L'.
