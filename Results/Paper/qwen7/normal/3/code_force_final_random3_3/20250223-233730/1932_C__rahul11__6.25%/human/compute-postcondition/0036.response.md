Output State: **`k` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `l` is the same as before, `r` is `r - 1`, `c` is increased by 1**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decreases the value of `r` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
