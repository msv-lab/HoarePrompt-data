Output State: **`arr` must have at least one element; `ans` is multiplied by the first element of `arr`; the new value of `ans` is the original `ans` multiplied by the first element of `arr`.**

This means that the value of `ans` has been updated to its original value multiplied by the first element of the list `arr`. The precondition that `arr` must have at least one element remains valid, and no other variables have been affected.
