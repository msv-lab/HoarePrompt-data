Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for k in range(n - 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `k` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `k < n - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1.

3. **Update the Values for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `k` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `k` will be 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `k` will be 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1 (unchanged).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`k` is 2, `n` is greater than 1**
