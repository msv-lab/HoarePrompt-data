Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n; `s` is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'; `MOD` is 10
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = list(input())
    res = [0] * n
    ans = 1
    for i in arr:
        ans *= i
    res[0] = ans % m % MOD
    c = 1
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for k in range(n - 1):
        if s[k] == 'L':
            ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD
            res[c] = ans % m % MOD
            l += 1
        else:
            ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD
            res[c] = ans % m % MOD
            r -= 1
        c += 1
    print(*res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: k is n-1, n is greater than 1, ans is the result of dividing the initial ans by each element in arr from either the left or right based on the string s, res[c] is the final value of ans % m % MOD, l is the leftmost index not yet processed, r is the rightmost index not yet processed, and c is equal to n-1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop executes all the iterations, `c` will be equal to `n`, `ans` will be the final value obtained by successively dividing it by elements in `arr` based on the direction indicated by characters in `s`, and `res` will be a list of length `n` where each element is the result of `ans` after each iteration, modulo `m` and `MOD`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `c` is equal to `n-1`, `ans` is the final value of `ans` after all iterations, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `l` is `n-1`, and `r` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
