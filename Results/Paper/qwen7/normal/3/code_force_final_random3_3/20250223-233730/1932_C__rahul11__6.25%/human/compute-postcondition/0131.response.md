Output State: **`res[c]` is equal to `ans % m % MOD`, `ans` is the value of `ans` divided by `arr[r-1]` and then modulo `MOD`, `k` is an index within the string `s`, and the character at index `k` in string `s` is not 'L'.**

Explanation: The variable `r` is decremented by 1, so `r` now holds the value `r-1`. The values of `res[c]`, `ans`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states. The character at index `k` in string `s` also remains the same, which is not 'L'.
