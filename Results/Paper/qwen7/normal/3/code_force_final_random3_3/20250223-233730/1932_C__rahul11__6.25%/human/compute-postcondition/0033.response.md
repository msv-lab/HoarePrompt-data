Output State: **`k` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `l` is increased by 1 (so `l` is now 2), `r` is decreased by 1 if `s[k]` is not 'L' (but `s[k]` is not specified, so `r` remains unchanged), `c` is increased by 1 (so `c` is now 1), `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`**.

This means that the variable `l` has been incremented by 1, making it 2. The other variables retain their previous conditions or values unless specified otherwise.
