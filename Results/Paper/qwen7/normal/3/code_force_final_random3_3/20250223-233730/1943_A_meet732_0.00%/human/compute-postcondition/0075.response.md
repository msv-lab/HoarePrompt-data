Output State: **`n` is `n - 2`, `j` is `1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `n` and `j`. It only breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no such block is specified in the given code snippet, the values of `n` and `j` remain unchanged from their initial state.
