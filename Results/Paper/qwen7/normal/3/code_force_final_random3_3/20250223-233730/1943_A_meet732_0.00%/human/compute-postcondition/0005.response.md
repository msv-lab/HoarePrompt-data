Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer that must have at least one element, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 1.**

Explanation: The code `cntl[i] += 1` increments the value of `cntl[i]` by 1. Since `cntl` is initialized as a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0, after executing this line, each element in `cntl` will be incremented by 1, making each element equal to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
