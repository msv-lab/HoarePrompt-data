Output State: **`j` is 3, `cntl[2]` is less than 2, `c` is 0 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The variable `c` is decremented by 1, so `c` changes from 1 to 0. The other variables (`j` and `cntl[2]`) remain unchanged, and the condition about breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement remains the same.
