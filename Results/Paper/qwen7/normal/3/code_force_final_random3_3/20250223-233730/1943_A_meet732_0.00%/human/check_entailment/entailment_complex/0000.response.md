Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, playing a game on an array `a` of size `n`. Alice picks elements from `a` and appends them to her array `c`, while Bob only removes elements from `a`. The goal is to determine the MEX (minimum excludant) of `c` after the game ends, considering both players play optimally.

2. **Key Points**:
   - Alice tries to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob tries to minimize the MEX.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates the frequency of each integer in the array `a` using `cntl`.
   - It then determines the MEX based on certain conditions involving the frequency counts.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Initialization and Frequency Calculation**: The code correctly initializes `cntl` and updates it with the frequencies of elements in `a`.
   - **MEX Calculation**:
     - If `cntl[0]` is 0, the MEX is 0.
     - Otherwise, the code calculates the MEX based on the frequencies of elements.
     - The logic for determining the MEX seems to handle the optimal play by both players, ensuring that Alice maximizes and Bob minimizes the MEX.

5. **Optimal Play Consideration**:
   - The code correctly handles the case where `cntl[0]` is 0.
   - For other cases, the code iterates through the frequencies and adjusts the MEX value accordingly.
   - The logic ensures that the smallest missing integer is found, which aligns with the optimal strategy for both players.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases like when `cntl[0]` is 0 and when there are no elements to consider beyond 0.

Based on the analysis, the given code correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX under optimal play conditions for both players.

Correctness: **True**
