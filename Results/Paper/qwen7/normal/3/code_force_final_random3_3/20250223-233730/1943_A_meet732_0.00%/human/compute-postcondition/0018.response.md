Output State: **`j` is 1; `cntl[j]` is less than 1**

Explanation: The initial state is `j` is 1, and the value of `cntl[j]` is less than 2. The code `c -= 1` decrements the value of `c` by 1. Since `cntl[j]` was less than 2, after decrementing `c` (which is `cntl[j]`), the new value of `cntl[j]` will still be less than 2 but specifically less than 1 because `c` was at least 1 initially. Therefore, `j` remains 1, and `cntl[j]` is now less than 1.
