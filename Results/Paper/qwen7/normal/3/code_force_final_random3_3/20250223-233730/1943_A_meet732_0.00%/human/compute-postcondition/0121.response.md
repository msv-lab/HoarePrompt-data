Based on the initial state provided:

- `cntl[0]` is the frequency of the integer 0 in the list `a`.
- `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0] - 2`.
- `j` is 2.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

The value of `j` is explicitly stated to be 2. Therefore, when the `print(j)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `j`.

Output: **2**
