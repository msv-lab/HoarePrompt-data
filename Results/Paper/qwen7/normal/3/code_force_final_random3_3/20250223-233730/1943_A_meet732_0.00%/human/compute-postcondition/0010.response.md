Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is equal to the count of occurrences of the corresponding index in the list `a`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the `cntl` list will contain the count of how many times each integer in the list `a` appears. This means that if an integer `i` appears `k` times in the list `a`, then `cntl[i]` will be `k`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, and `a`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
