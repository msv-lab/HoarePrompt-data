Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is set to `n - 2`. This implies that `n` is being assigned a value that is 2 less than its original value. However, since the original value of `n` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `n` after this assignment.
- `j` is explicitly stated to be `2`.
- `c` is decreased by 1, but the value of `c` before this operation is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `c` after this operation.

The `print(j)` statement will print the value of `j`.

Output: **2**
