Output State: **`n` is `n - 2`, `j` is `2`, `c` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The variable `c` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `n` is `n - 1`, and the value of `j` remains unchanged at 2. Therefore, after executing `c -= 1`, the value of `c` is decreased by 1, while `n` and `j` retain their original values relative to their initial state.
