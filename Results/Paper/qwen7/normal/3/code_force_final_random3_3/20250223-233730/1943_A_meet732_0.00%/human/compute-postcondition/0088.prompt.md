Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is 2 if `cntl[0]` is less than or equal to 2, otherwise `c` is 2.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if cntl[j] < 2:
        c -= 1
        if not c or j == n:
            print(j)
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `n` is decremented by 1, and the current value of `cntl[j]` is less than 2, and either `c` is False or `j` equals `n`, and in both cases, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `n` is `n - 1` and `j` is `1`. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, then `n` becomes `n - 2`. If `cntl[j]` is not less than 2, then the condition to break out of the most internal loop or if statement is checked, and if either `c` is `False` or `j` equals `n`, the loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `n` is `n - 1`, `j` is `2`, `c` is decreased by 1, and if `c` is false or `j` equals `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
