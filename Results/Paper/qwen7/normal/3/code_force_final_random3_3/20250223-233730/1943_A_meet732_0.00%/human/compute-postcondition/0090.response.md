Postcondition: `cntl[i]` is equal to the number of times the element `i` appears in the list `a`, `n` is an input integer, `t` is a new positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers, and after executing the if-else block, each element `cntl[i]` in the list `cntl` represents the count of how many times the index `i` appears in the list `a`. If `cntl[0]` is 0, the counts remain unchanged. Otherwise, `n` is decreased by 3, `j` is set to 3, and `c` is decreased by 3 (if `c` was initially at least 3); the loop breaks if `c` is reduced to 0 or less, or if `j` equals `n`.
