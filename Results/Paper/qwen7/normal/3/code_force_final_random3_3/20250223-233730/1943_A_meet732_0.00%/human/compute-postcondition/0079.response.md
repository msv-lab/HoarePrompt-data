Postcondition: `n` is `n - 1` and `j` is `1`. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, then `n` becomes `n - 2`. If `cntl[j]` is not less than 2, then the condition to break out of the most internal loop or if statement is checked, and if either `c` is `False` or `j` equals `n`, the loop or if statement is exited.
