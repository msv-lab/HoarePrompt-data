Output State: **`n` is `n - 1`, and the current value of `cntl[j]` is less than 2, and either `c` is False or `j` equals `n`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This means that the `break` statement causes the exit from the innermost loop or conditional block being executed. The values of `n`, `cntl[j]`, `c`, and `j` remain unchanged except for the fact that we are now outside the loop or conditional block.
