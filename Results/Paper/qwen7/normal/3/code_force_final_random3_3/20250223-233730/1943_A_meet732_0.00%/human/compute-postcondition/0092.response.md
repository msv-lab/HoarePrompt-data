Output State: **`cntl[i]` is equal to the number of times the element `i` appears in the list `a`, `n` is an input integer, `t` is a new positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` to the input integer, while the other variables (`cntl`, `t`, and `a`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
