Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used in the `for` loop to iterate over the range of input values.

2. **Determine the initial state needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute based on the input provided by `input()`.
   - The input is expected to be an integer representing the number of test cases, and this integer should be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).

3. **Adjust the state accordingly**:
   - Since the loop will run for each test case, the state before the loop starts should ensure that the input value `t` is valid and within the specified range.

Given the above points, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute correctly.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\)**
