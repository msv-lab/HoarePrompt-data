Output State: **`cntl[i]` is equal to the number of times the element `i` appears in the list `a`, `n` is an input integer, `t` is a new positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `a` is updated to a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and converts each integer to an int, then stores them in the list `a`. The other variables (`cntl[i]`, `n`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
