Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game's optimal strategy for both players. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that Alice and Bob play optimally, and it does not handle the game's state correctly.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
2
1 1
```

The output of the provided program is:
```
2
1
0
```

However, let's analyze the first test case more closely:
- Initially, `a = [0, 0, 1, 1]`.
- Alice starts by picking `0`, so `a = [0, 1, 1]` and `c = [0]`.
- Bob then picks `0`, so `a = [1, 1]` and `c = [0]`.
- Alice picks `1`, so `a = [1]` and `c = [0, 1]`.
- Bob picks `1`, so `a = []` and `c = [0, 1]`.

The MEX of `[0, 1]` is `2`. However, the program outputs `2` for this case, which is correct in this specific instance. But the issue arises when we consider the second test case:
- Initially, `a = [0, 1, 2, 3]`.
- Alice picks `0`, so `a = [1, 2, 3]` and `c = [0]`.
- Bob picks `1`, so `a = [2, 3]` and `c = [0]`.
- Alice picks `2`, so `a = [3]` and `c = [0, 2]`.
- Bob picks `3`, so `a = []` and `c = [0, 2]`.

The MEX of `[0, 2]` is `1`, but the program outputs `1`. This suggests that the program is not correctly simulating the optimal moves for both players.

To correctly simulate the game, the program needs to ensure that Alice maximizes the MEX and Bob minimizes it. The current implementation does not handle this complexity properly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
