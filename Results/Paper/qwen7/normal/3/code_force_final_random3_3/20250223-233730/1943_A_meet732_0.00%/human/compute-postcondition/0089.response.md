Postcondition: `cntl` is a list where each element `cntl[i]` represents the count of how many times the index `i` appears in the list `a`. Additionally, `n` is reduced by 3, `j` is set to 3, and `c` is reduced by 3 if it was initially greater than or equal to 3. If `c` is reduced to 0 or less, or if `j` equals `n`, the loop breaks out and these changes are applied.
