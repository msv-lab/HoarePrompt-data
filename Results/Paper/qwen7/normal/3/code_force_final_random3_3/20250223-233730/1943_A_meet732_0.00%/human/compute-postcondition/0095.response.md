Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in a:`. This means the loop variable `i` is taken from the list `a`.

2. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**: Since the loop depends on the list `a`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is related to `a`. The other variables (`cntl`, `n`, `t`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and can remain as they are.

3. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`. For the loop to execute, `a` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the state**: Given that `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, the only thing we need to ensure is that `a` contains at least one element. The values of the elements in `a` do not matter for the loop to execute, but the fact that `a` is non-empty is crucial.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `a` must be a non-empty list.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` is a non-empty list**
