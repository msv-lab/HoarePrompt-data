Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 24\), `a[i]` is incremented by 1.**

The code `a[i] += 1` increments the value of `a[i]` by 1. However, since `i` is not defined in the given initial state, the exact value of `a[i]` cannot be specified. Therefore, we only know that `a[i]` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
