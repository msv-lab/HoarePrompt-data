Output State: **`j` is 1 or 2; `n` must be at least 2; `xx[i][j - 1]` is either `nxF` or `'?'`; `nx` is `nxF`**.

Explanation: The variable `nx` is concatenated with the string `'F'`, changing its value from whatever it was initially (let's denote it as `nx`) to `nxF`. The other variables (`j`, `n`, and `xx[i][j - 1]`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
