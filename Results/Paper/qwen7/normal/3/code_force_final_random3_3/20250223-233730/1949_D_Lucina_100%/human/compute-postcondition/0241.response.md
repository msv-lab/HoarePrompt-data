Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
   - `i` is 2
   - `j` is 1
   - `nx` is either 'F' or 'S'
   - `n` is a positive integer
   - If `xx[2][0]` is not '?', then `nx` is either 'F' or 'S'
   - If `xx[2][0]` is '?', then `nx` is 'F' if either `i` or `j` is within the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, otherwise `nx` is 'S'

2. **Loop Head**: The loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for j in range(1, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Variables**: The only variable in the loop head is `j`.

4. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `j` is within the range `[1, n + 1)`. Since `j` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the loop will continue until `j` reaches `n + 1`.

5. **Adjusting States**: At the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will become `2`.

6. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`i`, `nx`, `n`, and `xx`) remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, these variables stay the same.

7. **Post-Condition**: The post-condition for `nx` remains the same based on the value of `xx[2][0]` and the range check involving `i` and `j`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 2, `nx` is either 'F' or 'S', `n` is a positive integer**
