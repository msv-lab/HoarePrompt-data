Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `2 * n + 1`, `j` will be `n + 1`, `n` will still be an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 24\), `xx` will be a list containing `n` strings, each being the input string `x`, `a` will be a list with counts of 'F' characters starting from index 1 up to `n`, and `b` will be a list with counts of 'S' characters starting from index 1 up to `n`.
