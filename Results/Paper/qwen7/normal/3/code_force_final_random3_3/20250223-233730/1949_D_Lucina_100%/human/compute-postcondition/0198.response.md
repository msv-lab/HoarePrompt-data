Output State: **`nx` is 'F', `i` is between 1 and n//4 - 1, `j` is between 1 and n inclusive, and the character at position `j-1` in `xx[i]` is `'?'`.**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. Since `nx` was initially an empty string, after executing this line, `nx` becomes 'F'. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged, and the condition about the character at position `j-1` in `xx[i]` also remains the same.
