Output State: **`i` is `n`, `j` is 3, `x` is an input string, `a` is a list where the element at index 3 is incremented by 1, and `b` and `xx` are unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `a[j] += 1` increments the element at index `j` (which is 3) in the list `a` by 1. The values of `i`, `x`, `b`, and `xx` remain unchanged.
