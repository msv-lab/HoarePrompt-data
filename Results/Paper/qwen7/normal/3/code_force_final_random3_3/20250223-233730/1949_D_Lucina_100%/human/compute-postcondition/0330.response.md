Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `nx` is either 'SF' or 'FS', and `xx[i][j - 1]` remains as '?'**.

Explanation: The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` concatenates the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` (which is '?') to the existing value of `nx`. Since `nx` could be either 'S' or 'F' initially, after concatenation, `nx` becomes either 'SF' or 'FS'. The values of `i`, `j`, `n`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` remain unchanged.
