Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `nx` is 'F', and neither `i` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]` nor `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`**

Explanation: The variable `nx` is concatenated with the string 'F', making its value 'F'. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
