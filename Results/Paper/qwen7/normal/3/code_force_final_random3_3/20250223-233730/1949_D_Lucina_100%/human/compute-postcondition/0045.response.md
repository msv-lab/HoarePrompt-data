Output State: **`i` is `n`, `j` is 2, `x` is an input string, `a` is a list where the element at index `n` is incremented by 1, and the current value of `x[j-1]` is 'F'**.

Explanation: The code `a[j] += 1` increments the value of `a[j]` by 1. Given that `j` is 1 initially, after the execution, `j` becomes 2 (since indexing starts from 0). The value of `a[n]` is incremented by 1, and the value of `x[j-1]` remains 'F' as no changes were made to `x`.
