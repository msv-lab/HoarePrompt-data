Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 1, `nx` is 'xx[2][0]', `n` must be a positive integer, the value of `xx[2][j - 1]` is not '?'**

Explanation: The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` appends the character `xx[i][j - 1]` to the string `nx`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2 and `j` is 1, so `xx[i][j - 1]` is equivalent to `xx[2][0]`. The value of `nx` is updated to include this character. All other variables remain unchanged.
