Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is 3, `n` must be at least 2, `nx` is either 'SSS' or 'SFF', and `xx[1][1]` remains unchanged and stays as '?'**

Explanation: The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` adds the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to `nx`. Given that `i` is 1 and `j` is 3, `xx[i][j - 1]` translates to `xx[1][2]`. Since the initial value of `nx` is either 'SS' or 'SF', adding 'S' (the assumed value of `xx[1][2]`) results in 'SSS' if `nx` was 'SS', or 'SFF' if `nx` was 'SF'. All other variables remain unchanged.
