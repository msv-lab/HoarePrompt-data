Output State: **`nx` is a string with the value 'F' appended to it, `j` is `j + 1`, `n` must be between 2 and 24, `xx[i][j]` is either not '?' or equals '?'. If `xx[i][j]` is not '?', `nx` is equal to the previous value of `nx` plus the value of `xx[i][j]`. If `xx[i][j]` is '?', then `nx` is a string. If `i` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, `nx` is a string with the value 'F' appended to it. Otherwise, `nx` is a string with the value 'S' appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. The value of `j` is incremented by 1. All other conditions and constraints remain the same as the initial state.
