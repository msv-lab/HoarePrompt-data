Output State: **`nx` is 'Fnx', `i` is 1, and `j` is `k + 2`.**

Explanation: The string `nx` is concatenated with the character 'F'. Since `nx` was initially a string, the operation `nx += 'F'` appends 'F' to the end of `nx`, making `nx` equal to 'Fnx'. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged from their initial states.
