Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is between 2 and 24, `sb` contains '3'**

Explanation: The code `sb.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `sb`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 3, `n` is still between 2 and 24, and `sb` now contains the value '3'.
