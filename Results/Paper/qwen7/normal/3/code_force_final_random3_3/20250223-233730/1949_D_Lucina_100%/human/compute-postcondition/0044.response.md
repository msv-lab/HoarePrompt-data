Output State: **`i` is `n`, `j` is 1, `x` is an input string, `a` is a list where the element at index `n` is incremented by 1, and the current value of `x[j-1]` is 'F'.**

Explanation: The code `a[i] += 1` increments the element at index `i` in the list `a` by 1. Since `i` is equal to `n`, the element at index `n` in the list `a` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
