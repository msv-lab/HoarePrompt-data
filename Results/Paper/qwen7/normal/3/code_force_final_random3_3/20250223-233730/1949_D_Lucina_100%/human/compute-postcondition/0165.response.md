Output State: **`nx` is a string with the value 'F' appended to it; `n` must be between 2 and 24; `(xx[i][j - 1])` is equal to `'?'`; `i` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`.**

Explanation: The variable `nx` is updated by appending the character 'F' to its current value. All other conditions and ranges remain unchanged from the initial state.
