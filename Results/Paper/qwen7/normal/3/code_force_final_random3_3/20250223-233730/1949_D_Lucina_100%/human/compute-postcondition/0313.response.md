Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `n + 1`
- `n` is between 2 and 24
- `nx` is a string composed of 'F', 'S', and possibly characters from `xx[i][j - 1]` where `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'

We need to determine what will be printed when `print(nx)` is executed. 

From the information given, `nx` is a string that can contain 'F', 'S', and potentially other characters from `xx[i][j - 1]`, but only if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'. Since the exact value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact additional characters in `nx`.

Therefore, the output will be a string composed of 'F', 'S', and possibly other characters from `xx[i][j - 1]` (if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?').

Output: **nx (where nx is a string composed of 'F', 'S', and possibly characters from xx[i][j - 1] if xx[i][j - 1] is not '?')**
