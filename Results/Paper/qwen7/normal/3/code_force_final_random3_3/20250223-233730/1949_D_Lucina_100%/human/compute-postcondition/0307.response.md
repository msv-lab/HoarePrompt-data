Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be between `2` and `24`, `nx` is either 'FS' followed by 'S' or 'SS' followed by 'S', and `xx[i][n]` is undefined.**

Explanation: The code `nx += 'F'` appends 'F' to the end of the string stored in `nx`. Given the initial state, `nx` could be either 'FS' or 'SS' followed by 'S'. After appending 'F', `nx` becomes either 'FSF' or 'SSF'. The values of `i`, `n`, and `xx[i][n]` remain unchanged.
