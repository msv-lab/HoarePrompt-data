Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 3, `nx` is 'SF', and `n` is a positive integer.**

Explanation: The variable `nx` is updated by appending the string `'F'` to its current value. Given that `nx` was initially either `'F'` or `'S'` followed by the character at index `xx[2][1]`, after appending `'F'`, `nx` becomes either `'SF'` (if it was originally `'F'`) or `'SFF'` (if it was originally `'S'` followed by another character). However, since the exact original value of `nx` is not specified beyond the format, we can only definitively say that `nx` now ends with `'F'`. The values of `i`, `j`, and `n` remain unchanged.
