Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length n+1 filled with zeros, `b` is a list of length n+1 filled with zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new list `b` with `n + 1` elements, all set to `0`. The length of `b` is `n + 1`, which is the same as the length of `a`. The initial state of `a` remains unchanged, and now `b` has been initialized with the required length and values.
