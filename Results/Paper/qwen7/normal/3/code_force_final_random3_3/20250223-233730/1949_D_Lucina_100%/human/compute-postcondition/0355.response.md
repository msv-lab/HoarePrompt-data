Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?'; `nx` is 'S'**.

Explanation: The variable `nx` is assigned the value `'S'`. The initial values of `j` and `n`, and the condition about the index in `xx` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `nx` holding the new value `'S'`, while the other conditions and values remain as they were initially.
