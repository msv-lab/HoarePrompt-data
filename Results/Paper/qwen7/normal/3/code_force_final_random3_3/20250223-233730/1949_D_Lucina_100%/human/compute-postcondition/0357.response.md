Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', and neither `i` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]` nor `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`; `nx` is 'F'**.

Explanation: The variable `nx` is assigned the value `'F'`. All other variables retain their initial or previously mentioned states. Specifically, `j` is incremented by 1 from 1 to 2, and the conditions regarding `i`, `n`, `xx[i][j - 1]`, and `sb` remain unchanged.
