Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be between 2 and 24, `a[i]` is 0, `b[i]` is greater than 0, `sa` is a list containing the value 1, `sb` is a list containing the value 1.**

The code appends the value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `sb`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
