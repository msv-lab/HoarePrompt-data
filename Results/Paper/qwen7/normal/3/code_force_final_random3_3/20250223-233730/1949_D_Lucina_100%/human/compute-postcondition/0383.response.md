Functionality: **The function processes a 2D list representing transition videos between scenarios. It counts the number of 'F' (funny) and 'S' (scary) videos for each scenario. Based on these counts and certain conditions, it constructs and prints a new list of transition videos. If the count of 'F' videos is greater than or equal to the count of 'S' videos, it prioritizes 'F' videos; otherwise, it prioritizes 'S' videos. The function ensures that the final output respects the initial constraints and prints the new list of transition videos.**
