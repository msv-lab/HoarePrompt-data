### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Input Processing**:
   - The program correctly initializes the necessary variables and processes the input to count the number of 'F' and 'S' transition videos already decided for each scenario.
   - It ensures that the input constraints are respected (e.g., the input is symmetric, and at most \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor\) transition videos are already decided).

2. **Distinguishing Between 'F' and 'S' Decisions**:
   - The program correctly identifies scenarios where only 'F' or only 'S' transition videos are needed based on the counts in `a` and `b`.
   - It ensures that the decision-making process respects the constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type for any permutation of scenarios.

3. **Handling Remaining Undecided Transition Videos**:
   - The program handles the remaining undecided transition videos ('?') by ensuring that the decisions made for these transitions do not violate the constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type.
   - It makes decisions based on the majority of 'F' or 'S' counts among the undecided scenarios, ensuring the constraint is met.

4. **Output Generation**:
   - The program generates the output by filling in the undecided '?' characters with either 'F' or 'S' based on the logic described above.
   - The output is formatted correctly, maintaining the symmetry and respecting the constraints.

Given the detailed analysis, the program appears to correctly handle the problem constraints and generate a valid solution. The logic for handling undecided transition videos and ensuring the constraint is met seems sound.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
