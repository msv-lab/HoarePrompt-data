Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `j`. The loop iterates over `j` from `1` to `n`.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - **Variable `j`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was in the range `[1, n]`. For the next iteration, `j` will increment by 1. Therefore, `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - **Variable `n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged within the loop.
   - **Condition for `nx`**:
     - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `'?'`, `nx` is updated based on its previous value.
     - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is `'?'`, `nx` is a string.
     - Additional conditions for `nx` based on the ranges of `i` and `j`:
       - If `i` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, `nx` is a string with `'F'` appended.
       - Otherwise, `nx` is a string with `'S'` appended.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `j` will increment by 1, the new value of `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - The conditions for `nx` remain the same as they depend on the values of `i`, `j`, `xx`, and `sa`, which do not change within the loop.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `j` will be `j + 1`.
- The conditions for `nx` will remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`n` must be between 2 and 24, `xx[i][j]` is either not '?' or equals '?'. If `xx[i][j]` is not '?', `nx` is equal to the previous value of `nx` plus the value of `xx[i][j]`. If `xx[i][j]` is '?', then `nx` is a string. If `i` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, `nx` is a string with the value 'F' appended to it. Otherwise, `nx` is a string with the value 'S' appended to it. `j` is `j + 1`**.
