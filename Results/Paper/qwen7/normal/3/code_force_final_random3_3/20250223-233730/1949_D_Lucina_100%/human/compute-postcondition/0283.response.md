Output State: **`nx` is `xx[i][j - 1]`, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be between 2 and 24, and the current value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to the string `nx`. Since `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', the updated value of `nx` is the concatenation of its previous value (which was an empty string) and the current value of `xx[i][j - 1]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial conditions, and the condition that `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?' also remains valid.
