Postcondition: `nx` is a string, `j` is incremented by 1, `n` must be between 2 and 24, `xx[i][j]` is either not '?' or equals '?'. If `xx[i][j]` is not '?', `nx` is equal to the previous value of `nx` plus the value of `xx[i][j]`. If `xx[i][j]` is '?', then `nx` remains a string. If `i` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, `nx` ends with 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` ends with 'S'.
