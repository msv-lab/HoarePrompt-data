Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `nx` is a string that depends on `xx`, `i`, `j`, and `sa`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is `n + 1`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i` in the range `1` to `n + 1`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know that the loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

4. **Current Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `j` is `n + 1`.

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `2`.
   - Since `j` is already `n + 1`, it does not change.

6. **State Adjustment:**
   - The only variable in the loop head that changes is `i`.
   - `j` remains `n + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `n + 1`**
