Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `x`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i < x`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `x` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `y` is an input integer from the split input.
   - If `x` is less than `y`, no changes are made to `x`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `x` as well.

4. **Analyze the loop execution**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, the loop will run as long as `0 < x`.
   - After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

5. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `1 < x` must hold true. Since `x` is an input integer greater than 0, this condition is always satisfied unless `x` was changed to 0 or less in some external context (which is not mentioned).

6. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `x` remains unchanged because no changes were made to it in the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `i` is 1, `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `y` is an input integer from the split input**.
