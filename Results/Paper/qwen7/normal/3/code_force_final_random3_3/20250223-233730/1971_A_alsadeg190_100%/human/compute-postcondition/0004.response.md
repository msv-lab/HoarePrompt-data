Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `i` is 0.
- `x` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `y` is an input integer from the split input.
- The current value of `x` is less than `y`.

The `print(x, y)` statement will print the values of `x` and `y`.

Output: **x, y (where x is an input integer greater than 0 and y is an input integer from the split input, with the condition that x < y)**
