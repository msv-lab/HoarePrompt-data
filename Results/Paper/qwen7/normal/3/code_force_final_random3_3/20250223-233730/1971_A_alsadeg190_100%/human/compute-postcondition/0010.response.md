Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `i` is 1, `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `y` is an integer from the split input, and `x` and `y` are assigned the values of the first and second integers from the input respectively.**

Explanation: The code snippet takes two integers as input using `input().split()` and converts them into integers using `map(int, ...)`. These two integers are then assigned to `x` and `y` respectively. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
