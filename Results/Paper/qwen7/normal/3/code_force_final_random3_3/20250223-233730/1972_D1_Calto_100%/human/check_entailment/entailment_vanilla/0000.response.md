Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **GCD Calculation Function (`func_1`)**:
   - This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `a` and `b`.
   - The logic is correct and will work as expected.

2. **Main Function (`func_2`)**:
   - The function aims to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The current implementation of `func_2` does not match the problem statement. Specifically:
     - The logic inside the loop does not correctly calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).
     - The variables `x` and `y` are not used in the context of the problem.
     - The formula `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` is not relevant to the problem.

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate through all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here is the corrected version of the main function:

```python
from math import gcd

def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt
```

### Testing with Provided Examples

Let's test the corrected function with the provided examples:

```python
# Test cases
test_cases = [
    (1, 1),
    (2, 3),
    (3, 5),
    (10, 8),
    (100, 1233),
    (1000000, 1145141)
]

# Expected results
expected_results = [1, 3, 4, 14, 153, 1643498]

# Check the function against the test cases
for n, m in test_cases:
    result = func_2(n, m)
    assert result == expected_results[test_cases.index((n, m))], f"Failed for {n} {m}"
print("All test cases passed.")
```

If the function passes all these tests, it is correct.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis and the need for a corrected approach, the initial implementation is incorrect. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
