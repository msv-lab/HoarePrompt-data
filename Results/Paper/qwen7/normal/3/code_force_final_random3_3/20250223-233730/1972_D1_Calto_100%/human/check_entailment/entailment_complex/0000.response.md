### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The function returns the GCD of `a` and `b`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function is supposed to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

However, the logic in `func_2` does not seem to correctly implement the required condition. Let's break down the problematic parts:

- The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `m`.
- Inside the loop, `x` is defined as \(n - (i^2 - i)\) and `y` is defined as \(i^2\).
- The variable `cnt` is updated using `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.

This approach does not correctly check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it seems to be performing some unrelated arithmetic operations.

To verify, let's consider a few examples:

- For \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\):
  - The expected output is 14, but the provided function outputs 8.
  - This discrepancy indicates that the logic in `func_2` is incorrect.

Given the significant mismatch between the expected results and the actual results, it is clear that `func_2` does not correctly solve the problem.

### Conclusion:

The program is incorrect because `func_2` does not correctly implement the required logic to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\).

**Correctness: **False**
