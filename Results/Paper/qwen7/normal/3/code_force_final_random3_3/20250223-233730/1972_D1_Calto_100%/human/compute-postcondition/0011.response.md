Output State: **`cnt` is 5, `i` is 4, `m` must be at least 3, `x` is `n - 12`, `y` is 9**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `x` to `n - (i * i - i)`. Given that `i` is 4, `i * i - i` equals `4 * 4 - 4` which is `16 - 4` resulting in `12`. Therefore, `x` becomes `n - 12`. The other variables (`cnt`, `i`, `m`, and `y`) remain unchanged.
