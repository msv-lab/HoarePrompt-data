State: **`cnt` is -1, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `m`.
2. The loop `for i in range(1, m + 1):` will start with `i` equal to 1 and continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `m`.
3. For the loop to execute at least once, `m` must be greater than 0 because the range function starts from 1 and goes up to `m`, inclusive.
4. The initial value of `cnt` being -1 does not affect the condition for the loop to start executing, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` set to 1 (the starting value of the range), and `m` must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop can execute.
