Output State: **`cnt` is 3, `i` is 4, `m` must be at least 3, `x` is -8, `y` is 16**

Step-by-step calculation:
1. The initial value of `cnt` is 5.
2. The value of `math.ceil(x / y)` is calculated as follows:
   - `x / y` is `-8 / 16`, which equals `-0.5`.
   - `math.ceil(-0.5)` rounds `-0.5` up to `-0`, because the ceiling function rounds towards the smaller integer.
3. The value of `x % y` is `-8 % 16`, which equals `-8` since the remainder when `-8` is divided by `16` is `-8`.
4. The expression `x % y == 0` evaluates to `True` because `-8` is exactly divisible by `16`.
5. Therefore, `x % y == 0` contributes `1` to the sum.
6. Combining these, `cnt` is updated to `5 + 0 + 1 = 6 - 3 = 3`.

All other variables (`i`, `m`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged.
