You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
    return cnt



- Annotated Code: 
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_2(n, m)
    print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\).
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `a` will be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`, and `b` will be 0.
    #
    #This is because the given loop implements the Euclidean algorithm, which is used to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers. The loop continues until `b` becomes 0, at which point `a` holds the GCD of the initial values of `a` and `b`.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`, with `b` being 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`. It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. After the calculation, it returns the GCD as the value of `a`, with `b` being 0.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6.
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        
        y = i * i
        
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
        
    #State: Output State: `cnt` is 6, `i` is 5, `m` must be at least 3, `x` is -21, `y` is 25.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues until `i` exceeds `m`. From the given information, we can see that after 3 iterations, `i` is 4 and `m` must be at least 3. For the loop to complete all its iterations, it needs to run for `m` values from 1 to the final value of `i` which is 4 in this case. Therefore, the loop will run 4 times in total. 
    #
    #- After 1st iteration: `cnt` = 2, `i` = 2, `x` = `n - 1`, `y` = 4
    #- After 2nd iteration: `cnt` = 5, `i` = 3, `x` = `n - 8`, `y` = 9
    #- After 3rd iteration: `cnt` = 8, `i` = 4, `x` = -8, `y` = 16
    #
    #For the 4th iteration:
    #- `i` = 5
    #- `x` = `n - (5 * 5 - 5)` = `n - 20`
    #- `y` = `5 * 5` = 25
    #- `cnt` = `8 + math.ceil((-20) / 25) + ((-20) % 25 == 0)` = `8 + 0 + 0` = 8
    #
    #Thus, after the loop completes all its iterations, `cnt` will be 8, `i` will be 5, `m` must be at least 3, `x` will be `-21` (since `n - 20 - 1`), and `y` will be 25.
    return cnt
    #The program returns 8, with `cnt` being 8, `i` being 5, `m` being at least 3, `x` being -21, and `y` being 25.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` (with 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6) and returns the integer `cnt`, which is calculated based on a series of operations within a loop. After the loop completes, `cnt` is set to 8, `i` is 5, `m` is at least 3, `x` is -21, and `y` is 25.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **GCD Calculation Function (`func_1`)**:
   - This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `a` and `b`.
   - The logic is correct and will work as expected.

2. **Main Function (`func_2`)**:
   - The function aims to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The current implementation of `func_2` does not match the problem statement. Specifically:
     - The logic inside the loop does not correctly calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).
     - The variables `x` and `y` are not used in the context of the problem.
     - The formula `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` is not relevant to the problem.

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate through all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here is the corrected version of the main function:

```python
from math import gcd

def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt
```

### Testing with Provided Examples

Let's test the corrected function with the provided examples:

```python
# Test cases
test_cases = [
    (1, 1),
    (2, 3),
    (3, 5),
    (10, 8),
    (100, 1233),
    (1000000, 1145141)
]

# Expected results
expected_results = [1, 3, 4, 14, 153, 1643498]

# Check the function against the test cases
for n, m in test_cases:
    result = func_2(n, m)
    assert result == expected_results[test_cases.index((n, m))], f"Failed for {n} {m}"
print("All test cases passed.")
```

If the function passes all these tests, it is correct.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis and the need for a corrected approach, the initial implementation is incorrect. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
