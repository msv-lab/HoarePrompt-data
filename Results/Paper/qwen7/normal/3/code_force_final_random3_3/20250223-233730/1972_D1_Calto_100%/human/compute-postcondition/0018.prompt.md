You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6.
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        
        y = i * i
        
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
        
    #State: Output State: `cnt` is 6, `i` is 5, `m` must be at least 3, `x` is -21, `y` is 25.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues until `i` exceeds `m`. From the given information, we can see that after 3 iterations, `i` is 4 and `m` must be at least 3. For the loop to complete all its iterations, it needs to run for `m` values from 1 to the final value of `i` which is 4 in this case. Therefore, the loop will run 4 times in total. 
    #
    #- After 1st iteration: `cnt` = 2, `i` = 2, `x` = `n - 1`, `y` = 4
    #- After 2nd iteration: `cnt` = 5, `i` = 3, `x` = `n - 8`, `y` = 9
    #- After 3rd iteration: `cnt` = 8, `i` = 4, `x` = -8, `y` = 16
    #
    #For the 4th iteration:
    #- `i` = 5
    #- `x` = `n - (5 * 5 - 5)` = `n - 20`
    #- `y` = `5 * 5` = 25
    #- `cnt` = `8 + math.ceil((-20) / 25) + ((-20) % 25 == 0)` = `8 + 0 + 0` = 8
    #
    #Thus, after the loop completes all its iterations, `cnt` will be 8, `i` will be 5, `m` must be at least 3, `x` will be `-21` (since `n - 20 - 1`), and `y` will be 25.
    return cnt
    #The program returns 8, with `cnt` being 8, `i` being 5, `m` being at least 3, `x` being -21, and `y` being 25.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters `n` and `m`, both of which are positive integers with a constraint of 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6. The function returns a tuple containing the values of `cnt`, `i`, `m`, `x`, and `y`, where `cnt` is 8, `i` is 5, `m` is at least 3, `x` is -21, and `y` is 25.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns 8, with `cnt` being 8, `i` being 5, `m` being at least 3, `x` being -21, and `y` being 25.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
