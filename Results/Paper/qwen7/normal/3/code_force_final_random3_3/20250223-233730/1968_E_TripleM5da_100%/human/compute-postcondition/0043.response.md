Functionality: **The function reads a positive integer \(t\) (where \(1 \leq t \leq 50\)) and \(t\) subsequent integers \(n\) (where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\)). For each \(n\), it prints pairs of numbers starting with 1 and incrementing the second number in each pair until it reaches \(n\). After processing all \(n\) values, the function ensures that the final value of \(i\) equals the last \(n\) and that \(n\) is at least 13. The function does not return any value.**
