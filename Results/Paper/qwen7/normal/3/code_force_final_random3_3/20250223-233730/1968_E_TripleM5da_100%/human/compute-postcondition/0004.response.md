State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. The loop condition is `range(3, n + 1)`, which means the loop will start with `i = 3` and continue as long as `i <= n`.
3. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 3 because the smallest value `i` can take is 3.
4. The variable `t` (which is between 1 and 50) does not affect the loop's execution based on the given condition.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can start executing, which means `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
