Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head includes the variable `i` and the range definition involving `n`.

2. **Determine the Current State**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
   - `i` is currently 3.
   - `n` must be at least 13.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs from `i` to `n + 1`, i.e., `for i in range(3, n + 1)`.

4. **Analyze the Previous Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 3, and `n` was at least 13.

5. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must increment by 1 from its current value (which is 3). Therefore, `i` will be 4.
   - The condition `i < n + 1` must still hold true. Since `i` is now 4, `n` must still be at least 13 to allow the loop to continue.

6. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be 4.
   - `n` must remain at least 13.

7. **Final State**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` is 4.
   - `n` must be at least 13.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `i` is 4, `n` must be at least 13**
