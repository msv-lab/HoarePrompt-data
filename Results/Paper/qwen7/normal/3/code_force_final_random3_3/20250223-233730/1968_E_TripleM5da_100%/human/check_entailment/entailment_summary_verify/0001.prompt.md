You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

For n=4 a possible arrangement is:

For n=5 a possible arrangement is:

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(0, int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        print(1, 1)
        print(1, 2)
        for i in range(3, n + 1):
            print(i, i)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a positive integer \(t\) (where \(1 \leq t \leq 50\)) and \(t\) subsequent integers \(n\) (where \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\)). For each \(n\), it prints pairs of numbers starting with 1 and incrementing the second number in each pair until it reaches \(n\). After processing all \(n\) values, the function ensures that the final value of \(i\) equals the last \(n\) and that \(n\) is at least 13. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to place \( n \) cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells is maximized.
2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program iterates over the number of test cases using `for i in range(0, int(input()))`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of \( n \).
   - It prints the coordinates `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)` as the first two cells.
   - Then, it prints a sequence of cells starting from `(3, 3)` up to `(n, n)`.

3. **Checking the Output**:
   - For \( n = 2 \): The output is:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     3 3
     ```
     This does not cover all possible Manhattan distances for \( n = 2 \). The correct output should include both `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)` to achieve the maximum set of distances.
   - For \( n = 3 \): The output is:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     3 3
     4 4
     ```
     This also does not cover all possible Manhattan distances for \( n = 3 \). The correct output should include cells like `(2, 1)`, `(2, 3)`, and `(3, 1)` as mentioned in the example.
   - For larger \( n \), the pattern continues to miss some cells that would maximize the set of Manhattan distances.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The given program does not correctly maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \( n \). It only prints a subset of cells that do not necessarily cover all possible Manhattan distances.
