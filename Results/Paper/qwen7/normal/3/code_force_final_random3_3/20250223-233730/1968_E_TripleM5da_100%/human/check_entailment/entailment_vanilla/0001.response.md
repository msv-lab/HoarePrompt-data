Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to place \( n \) cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells is maximized.
2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program iterates over the number of test cases using `for i in range(0, int(input()))`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of \( n \).
   - It prints the coordinates `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)` as the first two cells.
   - Then, it prints a sequence of cells starting from `(3, 3)` up to `(n, n)`.

3. **Checking the Output**:
   - For \( n = 2 \): The output is:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     3 3
     ```
     This does not cover all possible Manhattan distances for \( n = 2 \). The correct output should include both `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)` to achieve the maximum set of distances.
   - For \( n = 3 \): The output is:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     3 3
     4 4
     ```
     This also does not cover all possible Manhattan distances for \( n = 3 \). The correct output should include cells like `(2, 1)`, `(2, 3)`, and `(3, 1)` as mentioned in the example.
   - For larger \( n \), the pattern continues to miss some cells that would maximize the set of Manhattan distances.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The given program does not correctly maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \( n \). It only prints a subset of cells that do not necessarily cover all possible Manhattan distances.

Correctness: **False**
