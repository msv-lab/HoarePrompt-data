Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(0, int(input())):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and the input value used to define the range.

2. **Understand the Loop Execution**: The loop starts with `i` set to 0 and increments `i` until `i` is no longer less than the input value. Given that at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 6, this means the loop has already executed some number of times and `i` has been incremented to 6.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than the input value. Since `i` is currently 6, the input value must be greater than 6 for the loop to continue.

4. **Adjust the States**: The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `i`, and the input value. The state of `t` remains unchanged because it is not part of the loop head.

Given the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` must be 7 (since the loop increments `i` and it was 6 before).
- The input value must be greater than 6 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `i` is 7, the input value must be greater than 6.**
