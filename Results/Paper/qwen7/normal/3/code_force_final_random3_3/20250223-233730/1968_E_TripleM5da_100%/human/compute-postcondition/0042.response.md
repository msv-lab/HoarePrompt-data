Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but operates on two variables t and n, where t is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 50, and n is an integer within the range of 2 to 10^3. The function returns a value based on the relationship between t and n.**

However, since the function definition itself does not appear in the provided code snippet, and the output cases are not specified, the exact return value cannot be determined from the given information alone. The functionality described here focuses on the constraints and expected behavior of the input variables.
