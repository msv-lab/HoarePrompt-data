Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print(i, i)
```

However, the values of `i` are not explicitly defined in the initial state. Since no specific value for `i` is given, and there's no context suggesting how `i` might be assigned a value, we cannot determine a precise value for `i`.

Given this information, the output will depend on the value of `i` at the time of execution. Since `i` is not defined, we can only describe it in terms of its potential range or behavior if more context were provided.

Output: **i, i (where i is an unspecified value)**
