Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\)
   - `i` is 12
   - `n` must be at least 9

2. **Loop Head**:
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(0, int(input())):`

3. **Understanding the Loop**:
   - The loop starts with `i` set to 0 and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.
   - The loop will continue until `i` is equal to `int(input())`.

4. **Current State Analysis**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 12.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `int(input())`.
   - Since `i` is currently 12, `int(input())` must be greater than 12 for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and it is incremented by 1 in each iteration.
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 13.
   - Therefore, `int(input())` must be greater than 13.

6. **Final State**:
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
   - `i` is adjusted to 13.
   - `n` must still be at least 9, but since `i` is now 13, `n` must be at least 13 to allow the loop to continue.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), `i` is 13, `n` must be at least 13.**
