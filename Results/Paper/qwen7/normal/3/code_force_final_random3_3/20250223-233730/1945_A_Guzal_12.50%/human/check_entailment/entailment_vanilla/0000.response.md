Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Variable Initialization:**
   - `k` is initialized to 0. This variable is intended to store the total number of tents required.

3. **Condition Check for Impossibility:**
   - The condition `(b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0` checks if it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals:
     - `b % 3 != 0` means there is at least one extrovert who cannot share a tent with two others.
     - `c < 3` means there are fewer than 3 universals available to form a complete tent with the remaining extroverts.
     - `(b + c) % 3 != 0` means the remaining extroverts and universals cannot form complete groups of three.
   - If this condition is true, the program prints `-1` and moves to the next test case.

4. **Calculating Tents:**
   - `k += a + (b + c) // 3` adds the number of tents required for introverts (`a`) and complete groups of three people (`(b + c) // 3`).
   - If there are remaining extroverts and universals that do not form a complete group of three, `k += 1` is added to account for an additional tent.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `k` for each test case.

### Verification Against Examples

Let's verify the program against the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `1 2 3`
   - Calculation:
     - Introverts: 1 tent
     - Extroverts and Universals: 2 + 3 = 5, which forms 1 complete group of 3 and leaves 2 universals. These 2 universals need 1 more tent.
     - Total tents: 1 (introvert) + 1 (remaining) = 2
   - Output: `3` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `1 4 1`
   - Calculation:
     - Introverts: 1 tent
     - Extroverts and Universals: 4 + 1 = 5, which forms 1 complete group of 3 and leaves 2 universals. These 2 universals cannot form a complete group.
     - Output: `-1` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `1 4 2`
   - Calculation:
     - Introverts: 1 tent
     - Extroverts and Universals: 4 + 2 = 6, which forms 2 complete groups of 3.
     - Total tents: 1 (introvert) + 2 (remaining) = 3
   - Output: `3` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `1 1 1`
   - Calculation:
     - Introverts: 1 tent
     - Extroverts and Universals: 1 + 1 = 2, which cannot form a complete group.
     - Output: `-1` (Correct)

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: `1 3 2`
   - Calculation:
     - Introverts: 1 tent
     - Extroverts and Universals: 3 + 2 = 5, which forms 1 complete group of 3 and leaves 2 universals. These 2 universals need 1 more tent.
     - Total tents: 1 (introvert) + 1 (remaining) = 2
   - Output: `3` (Correct)

6. **Test Case 6:**
   - Input: `19 7 18`
   - Calculation:
     - Introverts: 19 tents
     - Extroverts and Universals: 7 + 18 = 25, which forms 8 complete groups of 3 and leaves 1 universal. This universal needs 1 more tent.
     - Total tents: 19 (introverts) + 8 (remaining) + 1 (universal) = 28
   - Output: `28` (Correct)

7. **Test Case 7:**
   - Input: `0 0 0`
   - Calculation:
     - No participants, so no tents are needed.
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

8. **Test Case 8:**
   - Input: `7 0 0`
   - Calculation:
     - No extroverts or universals, only introverts. 7 introverts need 7 tents.
   - Output: `7` (Correct)

9. **Test Case 9:**
   - Input: `0 24 0`
   - Calculation:
     - No introverts or universals, only extroverts. 24 extroverts can be grouped into 8 complete groups of 3.
   - Output: `8` (Correct)

10. **Test Case 10:**
    - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
    - Calculation:
      - Introverts: 1000000000 tents
      - Extroverts and Universals: 1000000000 + 1000000000 = 2000000000, which forms 666666666 complete groups of 3 and leaves 2 universals. These 2 universals need 1 more tent.
      - Total tents: 1000000000 (introverts) + 666666666 (remaining) + 1 (universal) = 1666666667
    - Output: `1666666667` (Correct)

### Conclusion

After verifying the program against all the provided test cases, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum number of tents required or returns `-1` when it is impossible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences.

**Correctness: True**
