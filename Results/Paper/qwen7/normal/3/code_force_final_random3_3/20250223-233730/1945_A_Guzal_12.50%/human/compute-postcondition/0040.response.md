Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of test cases, where each test case consists of three non-negative integers a, b, and c representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively. For each test case, if the number of introverts (a) and extroverts (b) combined is less than or equal to the number of universals (c), the function returns "Possible". Otherwise, it returns "Impossible".**
