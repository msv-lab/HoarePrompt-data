Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as per the problem description. Specifically, the program fails to account for the fact that each extrovert requires a tent with exactly two others, and it does not properly handle the scenario where there are not enough universals to pair with the extroverts.

Consider the following test case:
```
1 2 0
```
Here, there is 1 introvert, 2 extroverts, and 0 universals. According to the problem description, we need to place the introvert in their own tent, which uses 1 tent. The 2 extroverts need to share a tent with each other, but since there are no universals available, this is impossible. Therefore, the correct output should be `-1`.

However, the provided program will output `3` because it calculates `(b + c) // 3` and adds `1` if `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, without considering the requirement that each extrovert needs exactly two others.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle cases where there are not enough universals to satisfy the extroverts' preferences, leading to an incorrect result.
