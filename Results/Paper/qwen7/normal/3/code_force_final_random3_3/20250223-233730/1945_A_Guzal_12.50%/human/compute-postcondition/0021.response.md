Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3`.**

Explanation: The value of `k` is updated by adding `a + (b + c) // 3` to its current value. Since the initial value of `k` is 0, the new value of `k` is simply `a + (b + c) // 3`. The other variables remain unchanged.
