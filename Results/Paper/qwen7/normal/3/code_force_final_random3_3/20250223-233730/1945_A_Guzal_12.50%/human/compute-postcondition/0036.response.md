Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 3.
- `k` is defined as `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(k)
```

From the initial state, we know the value of `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`. However, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not explicitly given. Therefore, we can only express `k` in terms of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Output: **a + (b + c) // 3 + 1**
