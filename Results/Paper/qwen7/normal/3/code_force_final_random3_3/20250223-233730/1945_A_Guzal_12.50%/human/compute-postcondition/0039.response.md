Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the total number of iterations the loop executed, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces for the last iteration, `k` is the final value calculated based on the conditions in the loop body for the last iteration, and all previous `k` values are printed as per the loop's execution.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is the total number of times the loop ran.
- `i` will be `n - 1` since the loop increments `i` from 0 to `n - 1`.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are the values obtained from the last input provided to the loop.
- `k` holds the final value of `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1` if the condition `(b + c) % 3 != 0` was met during the last iteration, or just `a + (b + c) // 3` otherwise.
- All intermediate values of `k` calculated during each iteration are printed, with the final value of `k` being the last one printed.
