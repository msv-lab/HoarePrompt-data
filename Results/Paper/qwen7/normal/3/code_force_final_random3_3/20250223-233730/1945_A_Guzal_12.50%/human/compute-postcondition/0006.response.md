Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.
- `k` is 0.
- `b` is not divisible by 3.
- `c` is less than 3.
- The sum of `b` and `c` is not divisible by 3.

The print statement is:

```python
print(-1)
```

This statement directly prints the integer `-1` without any dependence on the values of other variables. Therefore, the output is simply `-1`.

Output: **-1**
