Output State: **`s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h` is the hour part of `s`, `m` is the minute part of `s`, `h1` is '02', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is an empty string, and `h` is equal to '02'**.

Explanation: The code `h1 = '02'` simply assigns the string `'02'` to the variable `h1`. This does not affect any other variables or their relationships. Therefore, the values of `s`, `t`, `h`, `m`, `m1`, `time`, and the condition of `h` being `'02'` remain unchanged.
