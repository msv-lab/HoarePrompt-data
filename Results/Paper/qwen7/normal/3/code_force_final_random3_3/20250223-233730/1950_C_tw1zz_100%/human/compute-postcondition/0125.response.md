Output State: **`s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h` is the hour part of `s` and its current value is '21', `m` is the minute part of `s` and its value remains unchanged, `h1` is '09', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is an empty string, and `h` is not equal to '20'.**

Explanation: The code `h1 = '09'` assigns the string `'09'` to the variable `h1`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
