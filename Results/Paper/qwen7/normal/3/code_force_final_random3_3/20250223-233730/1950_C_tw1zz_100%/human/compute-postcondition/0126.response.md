Output State: **`s` is a string of length 5 in the format "21:mm", `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h` is the hour part of `s` and its current value is '21', `m` is the minute part of `s` and its value remains unchanged, `h1` is '09', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is 'PM', and `h` is not equal to '20'.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the string `'PM'` to the variable `time`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
