To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Description**:
   - `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm". This means `s` looks like "10:30", "02:45", etc.
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440. This integer is not directly used in the print statement but might be related to the conversion logic.
   - `h` is the hour part of `s`. For example, if `s` is "10:30", then `h` is "10".
   - `m` is the minute part of `s`. For example, if `s` is "10:30", then `m` is "30".
   - `h1` is either "01" or one of the hours "02", "03", ..., "12", "13", "14", "16", "17". The exact value depends on the value of `h`.
     - If `h` is "10" or "11", then `time` is 'AM'.
     - Otherwise, `time` is 'PM'.
   - `m1` is equal to `m`.

2. **Print Statement Analysis**:
   - The print statement is `print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')`.
   - The `sep=''` argument means there will be no separator between the printed values, so the output will be a continuous string.

Given these details, let's consider different cases for `h`:

- If `h` is "10" or "11":
  - `time` will be 'AM'.
  - `h1` will be "10" or "11" (depending on the value of `h`).
  - The output will be in the format "10:30 AM" or "11:30 AM".

- If `h` is any other value (e.g., "02", "03", ..., "12", "13", "14", "16", "17"):
  - `time` will be 'PM'.
  - `h1` will be "02", "03", ..., "12", "13", "14", "16", "17" (depending on the value of `h`).
  - The output will be in the format "02:30 PM", "03:45 PM", etc.

Since the exact value of `h` is not specified, we need to consider both cases. However, the output format will always be consistent with the conditions described.

**Output**: **h1:m time** (where h1 is either "01" or one of the hours "02", "03", ..., "12", "13", "14", "16", "17", m is the minute part of s, and time is 'AM' if h is "10" or "11", and 'PM' otherwise).
