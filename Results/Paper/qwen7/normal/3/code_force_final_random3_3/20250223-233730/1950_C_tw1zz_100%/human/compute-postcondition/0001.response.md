Output State: **`s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h` is the hour part of `s`, `m` is the minute part of `s`.**

Explanation: The code splits the string `s` (which is in the format "hh:mm") into two parts using the colon `:` as a delimiter. The first part is assigned to `h` (hour) and the second part is assigned to `m` (minute). The original values of `s` and `t` remain unchanged.
