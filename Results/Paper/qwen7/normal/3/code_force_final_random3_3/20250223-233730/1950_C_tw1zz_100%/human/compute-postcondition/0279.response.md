Postcondition: `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h` is the hour part of the input split by ':', `m` is the minute part of the input split by ':', `h1` is either '07' or a value from '01' to '13' or '15', `m1` is equal to `m`, and `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM'. If the hour part `h` is '07', then `h1` is set to '07' and `time` is set to 'AM'. Otherwise, `h1` is set to either '08' or a value from '01' to '13' or '15', and `time` is set to either 'AM' or 'PM'.
