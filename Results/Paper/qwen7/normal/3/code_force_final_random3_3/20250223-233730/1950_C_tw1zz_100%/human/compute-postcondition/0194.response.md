Output State: **`s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h` is the hour part of the input split by ':', `m` is the minute part of the input split by ':', `h1` is either "01" or one of the hours "02", "03", ..., "12", "13", "14", "16", "17", `m1` is equal to `m`, and `time` is 'AM' if `h` is "10" or "11", and 'PM' if `h` is "17", and the input value for the next iteration is `int(input()) - 1`**.

Explanation: The code splits the input string `s` (which is in the format "hh:mm") into two parts using the `:` delimiter and assigns them to `h` and `m` respectively. The values of `t`, `h1`, `m1`, and `time` remain unchanged from their initial conditions. The input value for the next iteration is set to `int(input()) - 1`.
