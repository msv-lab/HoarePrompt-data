Output State: **`s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `h` is the hour part of the input split by ':', `m` is the minute part of the input split by ':', `h1` is '08', `m1` is equal to `m`, and `time` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The code `h1 = '08'` assigns the string `'08'` to the variable `h1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
