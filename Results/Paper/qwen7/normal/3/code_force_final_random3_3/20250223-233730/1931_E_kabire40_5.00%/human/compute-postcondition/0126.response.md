Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `x` and `operational_list`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `operational_list`. The value of `x` changes with each iteration, but the list `operational_list` remains the same.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is 0
   - `x_rev` is 0
   - Either `rev_res` is 0 or `rev_val` contains the reversed string of `x`

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `operational_list`, the next value of `x` will be the first element of `operational_list` if it hasn't been exhausted yet.
   - The value of `x_rev` will be 0 because it is reset for each new value of `x` in the loop.
   - The state of `rev_res` and `rev_val` will depend on the operation performed within the loop body, but since no specific operations are mentioned, we assume they remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration unless modified inside the loop.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `x` will be the next element in `operational_list`.
   - `x_rev` will be 0.
   - The condition for `rev_res` and `rev_val` remains the same unless modified inside the loop.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`x` is the next element in `operational_list`, `x_rev` is 0, and either `rev_res` is 0 or `rev_val` contains the reversed string of `x`.**
