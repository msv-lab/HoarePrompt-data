Postcondition: **`x` is the next element in `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reverse of `x`, `rev_res` contains `x` if the length of `x` is equal to the length of `x_rev` and is an empty list otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of `x` if the lengths of `x` and `x_rev` are not equal, otherwise `rev_val` remains an empty list.**
