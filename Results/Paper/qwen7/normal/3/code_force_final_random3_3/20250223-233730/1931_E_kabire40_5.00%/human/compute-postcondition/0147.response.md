Postcondition: `rev_val` is a non-empty list, `rev_res` is a string. If `x` is an even number, `rev_res` is the original value of `rev_res` concatenated with the string representation of the integer value of the element at index `x` in `rev_val`. If `x` is an odd number, `rev_res` is `rev_res` plus the reverse of the element at index `x` in `rev_val`.
