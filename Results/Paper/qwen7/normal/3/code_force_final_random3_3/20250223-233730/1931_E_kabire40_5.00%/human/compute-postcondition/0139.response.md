Output State: **`rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed forms of all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed form has a different length than the original element.**

Explanation: The code `rev_val.sort()` sorts the list `rev_val` in ascending order. Since the initial state does not specify the exact contents of `rev_val`, we only know that it contains the reversed forms of elements from `operational_list` whose original lengths were different. The sorting operation does not affect the content of other variables, so their states remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is that `rev_val` is now sorted.
