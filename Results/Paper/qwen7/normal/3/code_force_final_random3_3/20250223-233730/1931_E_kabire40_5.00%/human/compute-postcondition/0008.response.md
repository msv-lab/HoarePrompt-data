Output State: **`rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is `x`, `list_len` is the length of the input string, `max_power` is the maximum power of the input string, `operational_list` is a list created from the split input and must not be empty, and the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of the original string `x`.**

Explanation: The line `rev_res = rev_res + x` appends the value of `x` to `rev_res`. Initially, `rev_res` is an empty string. After executing this line, `rev_res` becomes `x`. All other variables remain unchanged.
