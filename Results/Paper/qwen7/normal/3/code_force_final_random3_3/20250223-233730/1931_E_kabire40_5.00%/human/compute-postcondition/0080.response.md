Output State: **`rev_val` is sorted. All other variables retain their previous states.**

Explanation: The line `rev_val.sort()` sorts the list `rev_val`. Since the initial state does not specify the contents of `rev_val`, we only know that after sorting, `rev_val` will be in ascending order. The other variables (`x`, `x_rev`, `rev_res`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
