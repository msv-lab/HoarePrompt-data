Output State: **`rev_val` is a non-empty list, `rev_res` is a string equal to the original `rev_res` plus the reverse of the element from `rev_val` at index `x`, `x` is incremented by 1.**

This means that the string `rev_res` has been updated by appending the reverse of the element from `rev_val` at index `x`. The variable `x` has been incremented by 1, and the other variables retain their initial conditions.
