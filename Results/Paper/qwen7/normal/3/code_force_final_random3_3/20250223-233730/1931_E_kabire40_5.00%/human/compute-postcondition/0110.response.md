Based on the initial state provided:

- `x` is an integer equal to `len(rev_val)`, meaning `x` is the length of the list `rev_val`.
- `rev_val` remains unchanged as a list.
- `rev_res` is a string constructed by appending the string representation of elements at even indices and concatenating the reverse of elements at odd indices.

The `print('Anna')` statement simply prints the string "Anna".

Output: **Anna**
