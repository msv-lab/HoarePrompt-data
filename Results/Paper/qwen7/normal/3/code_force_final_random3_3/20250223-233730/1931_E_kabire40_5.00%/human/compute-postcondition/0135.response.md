Output State: **`x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of `x`, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x`.**

Explanation: The code appends the reversed string of `x` to the list `rev_val`. The variable `x_rev` remains unchanged and still holds the integer value of the reverse of `x`. The list `rev_val` now contains one element, which is the reversed string of `x`.
