Output State: **`y` is `k + 1`, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is an input string, `max_power` is an input string**

Explanation: The code splits the input string into two parts using the `split()` function, assigning the first part to `list_len` and the second part to `max_power`. The values of `y`, `rev_val`, and `rev_res` remain unchanged from their initial state.
