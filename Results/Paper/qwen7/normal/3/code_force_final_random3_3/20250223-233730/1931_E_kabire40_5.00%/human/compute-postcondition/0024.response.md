Output State: **`rev_val` is a sorted list of the reversed strings from the original `operational_list`, `rev_res` is an empty string, `list_len` is the length of the input string, `max_power` is the maximum power of the input string, `operational_list` is an empty list after all elements have been processed, and `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x` for the current iteration.**

Explanation: The code `rev_val.sort()` sorts the list `rev_val` in ascending order. The other variables (`rev_res`, `list_len`, `max_power`, `operational_list`, and `x_rev`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the sorting operation.
