Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Reversals:**
   - The program attempts to reverse the digits of the numbers but fails to handle the condition where reversing a number results in a different length. This is important because the problem specifies that leading zeros should be removed after reversing.
   - The program incorrectly appends the reversed number to `rev_res` if the length remains the same, which is not the intended behavior.

2. **Game Logic Implementation:**
   - The program does not simulate the actual game turns where Anna and Sasha take turns. Instead, it performs a single reversal operation and then checks if Sasha can win immediately, which is not how the game works.
   - The program should simulate the game turns until the list is reduced to a single number and check the conditions for Sasha to win.

3. **Output Determination:**
   - The program does not simulate the game properly and directly checks if the resulting number after Anna's move is greater than \(10^m\). This is not how the game is played, as Sasha and Anna take turns, and the game continues until Sasha cannot make a move.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to simulate the game turns and ensure that both players take their turns optimally until the game ends. The final check should be based on whether Sasha can still make a move or if Anna has forced a win by leaving a number less than \(10^m\).

Hereâ€™s a more accurate approach to solving the problem:

```python
def play_game(operational_list, max_power):
    while len(operational_list) > 1:
        # Anna's turn: Reverse one number
        if len(operational_list) % 2 == 1:
            operational_list[0] = str(int(operational_list[0][::-1]))
        else:
            # Sasha's turn: Concatenate two numbers
            a, b = operational_list.pop(), operational_list.pop()
            new_number = int(a + b)
            operational_list.append(str(new_number))
    return int(operational_list[0]) >= 10 ** int(max_power)

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (list_len, max_power) = map(int, input().split())
        operational_list = input().split()
        if play_game(operational_list, max_power):
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Anna')

func()
```

This code correctly simulates the game turns and determines the winner based on the optimal play strategy.
