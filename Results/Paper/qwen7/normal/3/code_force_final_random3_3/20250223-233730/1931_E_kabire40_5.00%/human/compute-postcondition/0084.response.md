Output State: **`x` is 1, `rev_res` is the concatenation of `rev_res` and the string representation of `val_in`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `rev_res += str(val_in)` appends the string representation of `val_in` to `rev_res`. Since `val_in` is the integer value of the element at index `x` in `rev_val`, and `x` was initially 0, `x` is now incremented by 1 (becoming 1) after accessing the element. The value of `rev_res` is updated by adding the string representation of `val_in` to its current value.
