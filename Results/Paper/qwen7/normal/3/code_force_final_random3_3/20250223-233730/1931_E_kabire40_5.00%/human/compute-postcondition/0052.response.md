Based on the initial state provided:

- `rev_res` will be a string that concatenates the integer representations of even-indexed elements from `rev_val` and the reversed versions of odd-indexed elements from `rev_val`, in the order they appear in `rev_val`.

However, the initial state does not provide any specific values for `rev_val`. Since the `print` statement simply prints the string `'Anna'`, and there is no information about `rev_val` affecting this output, we can conclude that the `print` statement will directly output the string `'Anna'`.

Output: **Anna**
