Reasoning:
1. The program correctly defines the function `func_1` which processes each test case to find the appropriate `y` value.
2. The logic within the function is sound:
   - It initializes `max_sum` to 0 and `best_y` to 1.
   - It iterates over all possible values of `y` from `x-1` down to 1.
   - For each `y`, it calculates the GCD with `x` and the sum of the GCD and `y`.
   - If this sum is greater than the current `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and sets `best_y` to the current `y`, then breaks out of the loop.
   - This ensures that the first `y` found that maximizes the sum is selected.
3. The function then appends `best_y` to the results list and returns it after processing all test cases.
4. The main part of the program reads the input, calls `func_1`, and prints the results, which aligns with the expected behavior.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correctly implemented according to the problem description and the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
