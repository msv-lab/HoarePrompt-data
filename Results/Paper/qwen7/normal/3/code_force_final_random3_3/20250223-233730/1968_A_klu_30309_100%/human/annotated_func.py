#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and test_cases is a list of positive integers such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000 for each x in test_cases.

    #State: Output State: The `results` list will contain the `best_y` values found for each `x` in `test_cases`. For each `x` in `test_cases`, `best_y` is the largest integer less than `x` such that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `best_y` plus `best_y` is maximized. The `max_sum` variable, which keeps track of the maximum sum found for each `x`, and the `best_y` variable, which stores the corresponding `y` value, will be updated accordingly within each iteration but will not affect the final state of the `results` list. The `gcd_val` variable will hold the GCD of the last `x` and `best_y` found for each `x` in `test_cases`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, the `results` list will contain the optimal `y` values (less than each `x`) for each `x` in `test_cases`, where the sum of the GCD of `x` and `y` plus `y` is maximized.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of best_y values, where each best_y is the largest integer less than the corresponding x in test_cases such that the sum of the GCD of x and best_y plus best_y is maximized.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `t` (though `t` is not used in the function), a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `test_cases`, a list of positive integers between 2 and 1000. It returns a list of `best_y` values, where each `best_y` is the largest integer less than the corresponding `x` in `test_cases` such that the sum of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `best_y` plus `best_y` is maximized.
