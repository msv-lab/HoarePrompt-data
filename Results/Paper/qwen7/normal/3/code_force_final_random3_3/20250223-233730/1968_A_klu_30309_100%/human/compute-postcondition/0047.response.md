Output State: **`max_sum` is the maximum value between its original value (0) and `current_sum`, `best_y` is either its original value (1) or `y` if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, `results` list still contains 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `y` is `y - 1`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y**.

Explanation: The code updates `current_sum` to be the sum of `gcd_val` and `y`. The other variables (`max_sum`, `best_y`, `results`, and `gcd_val`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `y` is decremented by 1.
