Output State: **`max_sum` is the highest value of `gcd_val + y` found during any iteration of the loop, `best_y` is the corresponding `y` value that produced this maximum sum, the `results` list now contains `best_y`, and `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `best_y`.**

This means that the `results` list has been updated to include the `best_y` value, while all other conditions and values remain unchanged from their previous states.
