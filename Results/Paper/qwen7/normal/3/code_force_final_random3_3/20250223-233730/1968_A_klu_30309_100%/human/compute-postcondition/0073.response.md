Output State: **`max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`. Otherwise, `max_sum` remains unchanged; `best_y` is `x - 1`; the `results` list now contains 1; `gcd_val` is unchanged; `x` is the next value from `test_cases`; `y` is `x - 2`; `gcd_val` is updated to `math.gcd(x, y - 2)`**.

In this output state, the `gcd_val` variable is updated to the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` (which is `x - 2`). All other variables remain in their previous states as described in the initial state.
