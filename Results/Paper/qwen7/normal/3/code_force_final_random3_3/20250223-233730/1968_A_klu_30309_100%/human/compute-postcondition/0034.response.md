Output State: **`max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `results` list is appended with 1.**

Explanation: The variable `best_y` is assigned the value 1. The values of `max_sum` and the `results` list are updated according to the assignment, but no other changes are made to the initial state. Therefore, `max_sum` remains 0, `best_y` is now 1, and the `results` list contains the appended value 1.
