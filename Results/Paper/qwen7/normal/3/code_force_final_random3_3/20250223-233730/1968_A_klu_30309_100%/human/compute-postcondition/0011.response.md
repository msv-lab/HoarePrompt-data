Output State: **`max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum`, `best_y` is now equal to `x-1`, `x` must be greater than 1, `y` is `x-1`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only exits the current loop or conditional block. Therefore, all the previous conditions and values remain the same.
