Output State: `max_sum` will hold the maximum value of `gcd_val + y` found during all iterations of the loop, `best_y` will be the corresponding `y` value that produced this maximum sum, the `results` list will contain 1 (unchanged), `gcd_val` will be the greatest common divisor of the final `x` and its corresponding `y` (`best_y`), and `x` will be the last value from `test_cases` that was processed.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `max_sum` and `best_y` will reflect the highest possible sum of the greatest common divisor and `y` for any pair `(x, y)` where `y` ranges from `x-1` down to 1, and `x` iterates through all values in `test_cases`. The `results` list remains unchanged at `[1]`, and `gcd_val` is the GCD of the last `x` and `best_y` found.
