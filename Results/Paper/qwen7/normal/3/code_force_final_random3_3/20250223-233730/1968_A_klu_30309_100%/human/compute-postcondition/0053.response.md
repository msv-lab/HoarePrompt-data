Output State: **`max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `best_y` is `y - 1`, `results` list still contains 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y - 1`, `y` is `y - 2`, `current_sum` is `math.gcd(x, y - 1) + (y - 1)**

Explanation: The code updates `gcd_val` to be the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y - 1`. Since `y` was previously `y - 1 - 1` (or `y - 2`), the new value of `y` remains `y - 2`. The other variables (`max_sum`, `best_y`, `results`, and `current_sum`) remain unchanged from their previous values.
