Output State: **The final output state will have `max_sum` set to the highest value of `gcd_val + y` found during any iteration of the loop, `best_y` will be the corresponding `y` value that produced this maximum sum, the `results` list will still contain 1, and `gcd_val` will be the greatest common divisor of `x` and `best_y`.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `max_sum` will hold the largest sum obtained from adding the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` to `y` for any `y` in the range from `x-1` down to 1. The `best_y` variable will store the specific `y` value that resulted in this maximum sum. The `results` list remains unchanged as it was initialized with a single value of 1 and no further modifications were made to it within the loop. The `gcd_val` will be the greatest common divisor of `x` and `best_y` after the loop completes.
