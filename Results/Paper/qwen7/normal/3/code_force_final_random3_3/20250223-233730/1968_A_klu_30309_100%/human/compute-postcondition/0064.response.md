Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):`. The variables involved here are `y`, `x`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `x` is the next value from `test_cases`.
   - `y` will start from `x - 1` and decrement until it reaches 0.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `y` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `x - 1`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `x` is the next value from `test_cases`, its initial state is not specified directly but it should be a positive integer (since `y` starts from `x - 1`).
   - `y` will start from `x - 1` and decrement, so initially, `y` should be `x - 1`.

Given the above points, we need to ensure that `x` is a positive integer and `y` is set to `x - 1`.

**State after adjustment**:
- `max_sum` is 0.
- `best_y` is 1.
- `results` list now contains 1.
- `gcd_val` is unchanged.
- `x` is the next value from `test_cases` (which we assume to be a positive integer).
- `y` is `x - 1`.

So, the final state is:

**State: **`max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, the `results` list now contains 1, `gcd_val` is unchanged, `x` is the next value from `test_cases` (a positive integer), `y` is `x - 1**.
