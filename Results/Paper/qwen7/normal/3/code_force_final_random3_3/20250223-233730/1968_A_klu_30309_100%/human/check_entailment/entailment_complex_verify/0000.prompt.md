You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and test_cases is a list of positive integers such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000 for each x in test_cases.
def func_1(t, test_cases):

    #State: Output State: The `results` list will contain the `best_y` values found for each `x` in `test_cases`. For each `x` in `test_cases`, `best_y` is the largest integer less than `x` such that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `best_y` plus `best_y` is maximized. The `max_sum` variable, which keeps track of the maximum sum found for each `x`, and the `best_y` variable, which stores the corresponding `y` value, will be updated accordingly within each iteration but will not affect the final state of the `results` list. The `gcd_val` variable will hold the GCD of the last `x` and `best_y` found for each `x` in `test_cases`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, the `results` list will contain the optimal `y` values (less than each `x`) for each `x` in `test_cases`, where the sum of the GCD of `x` and `y` plus `y` is maximized.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of best_y values, where each best_y is the largest integer less than the corresponding x in test_cases such that the sum of the GCD of x and best_y plus best_y is maximized.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `t` (though `t` is not used in the function), a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `test_cases`, a list of positive integers between 2 and 1000. It returns a list of `best_y` values, where each `best_y` is the largest integer less than the corresponding `x` in `test_cases` such that the sum of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `best_y` plus `best_y` is maximized.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find an integer \( y \) such that \( 1 \le y < x \) and the sum \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized. Here's a breakdown of why the program works for all potential cases:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `max_sum` to 0 and `best_y` to 1. This ensures that the loop will start checking from the highest possible value of \( y \) (i.e., \( x-1 \)) and update `best_y` as soon as a higher sum is found.

2. **Loop through possible values of \( y \)**: The loop iterates from \( x-1 \) down to 1, calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( x \) and \( y \), and then adding \( y \) to get the current sum. If this sum is greater than the previously recorded `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and sets `best_y` to the current \( y \). The loop breaks early once a higher sum is found, ensuring efficiency.

3. **Appending results**: After processing all test cases, the program appends the best \( y \) found for each \( x \) to the results list and prints these results.

Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the program handles all potential cases correctly. There are no obvious edge cases or scenarios where the program would fail to meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
