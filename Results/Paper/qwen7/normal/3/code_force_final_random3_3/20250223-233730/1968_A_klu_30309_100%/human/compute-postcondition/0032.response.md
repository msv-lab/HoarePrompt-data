Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `x` from the `test_cases` list.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each element in `test_cases`. Since the loop has completed all its iterations, it means that every element in `test_cases` has been processed.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**: After the loop completes, there are no more elements in `test_cases` to process. Therefore, the variable `x` does not need to be adjusted because there are no remaining values in `test_cases`.

4. **Check other relevant states**:
   - `max_sum`: This holds the highest value of `gcd_val + y` found during any iteration. Since the loop has completed, this value remains unchanged.
   - `best_y`: This stores the value of `y` that resulted in the highest `current_sum`. This value also remains unchanged.
   - `results`: This list is appended with `best_y` after each iteration. Since the loop has completed, the list `results` contains all the `best_y` values from each iteration.

Given that the loop has completed all its iterations, there are no changes needed to the loop head variables or the conditions for the loop to execute again. Therefore, the state remains as it was after the last iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`max_sum` holds the highest value of `gcd_val + y` found during any iteration, `best_y` stores the value of `y` that resulted in the highest `current_sum`, `results` list is appended with `best_y`**.
