Output State: **`max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `results` list contains 1, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `current_sum` to be the sum of `gcd_val` and `y`. The values of `max_sum`, `best_y`, and the contents of the `results` list remain unchanged from their initial states.
