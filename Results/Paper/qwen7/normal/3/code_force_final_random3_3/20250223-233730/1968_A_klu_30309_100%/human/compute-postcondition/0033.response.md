Output State: **`max_sum` is 0, `best_y` stores the value of `y` that resulted in the highest `current_sum`, `results` list is appended with `best_y`.**

Explanation: The code sets `max_sum` to 0. This means that the highest value of `gcd_val + y` found during any iteration is now 0. The values of `best_y` and `results` remain unchanged from their previous states, meaning `best_y` still stores the value of `y` that resulted in the highest `current_sum`, and `results` is still appended with `best_y`.
