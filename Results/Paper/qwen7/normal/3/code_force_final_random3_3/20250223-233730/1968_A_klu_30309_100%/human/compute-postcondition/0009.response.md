Output State: **`max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum`, `best_y` is still 1, `x` must be greater than 1, `y` is `x-1`, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`**

Explanation: The line `max_sum = current_sum` updates the value of `max_sum` to be equal to the current value of `current_sum`. All other variables (`best_y`, `x`, `y`, `gcd_val`, and `current_sum`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
