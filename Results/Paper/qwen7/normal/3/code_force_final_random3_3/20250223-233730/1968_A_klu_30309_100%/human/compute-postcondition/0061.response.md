Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in the given code is `for x in test_cases`. The variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `test_cases`.

2. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `x` is the variable being iterated over from `test_cases`.
   - `test_cases` is the list from which `x` is taken.

3. **Analyze the current state**:
   - `max_sum` is the highest value of `gcd_val + y` found during any iteration of the loop.
   - `best_y` is the corresponding `y` value that produced this maximum sum.
   - `results` list now contains `best_y`.
   - `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `best_y`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `x` is the variable being iterated, it will take the next value from `test_cases`.
   - `test_cases` remains the same list, but `x` will be the next element in the list.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `max_sum`, `best_y`, `results`, and `gcd_val` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head and their values are determined outside the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`max_sum` is the highest value of `gcd_val + y` found during any iteration of the loop, `best_y` is the corresponding `y` value that produced this maximum sum, the `results` list now contains `best_y`, and `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `best_y`, `x` is the next value from `test_cases`**.
