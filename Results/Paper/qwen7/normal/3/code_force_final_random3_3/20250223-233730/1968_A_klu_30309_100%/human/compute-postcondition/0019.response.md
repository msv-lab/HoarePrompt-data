Output State: **`max_sum` is equal to `gcd_val + (y - 1)`, `best_y` is equal to `y - 1`, `x` retains its original value, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since no loop or conditional block is specified in the code snippet, the `break` statement does not change the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `max_sum`, `best_y`, `x`, and `gcd_val` remain unchanged, and we simply indicate that the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
