Output State: **`max_sum` is equal to `gcd_val + (y - 1)`, `best_y` retains its original value, `x` retains its original value, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y-1`, `current_sum` is no longer defined, `y` is `y - 1**.

Explanation: The line `max_sum = current_sum` updates the value of `max_sum` to be equal to the value of `current_sum`. Since `current_sum` was defined as `gcd_val + (y - 1)`, `max_sum` now holds this value. All other variables retain their original values except for `current_sum`, which is no longer defined after the assignment. Additionally, `y` is updated to `y - 1`.
