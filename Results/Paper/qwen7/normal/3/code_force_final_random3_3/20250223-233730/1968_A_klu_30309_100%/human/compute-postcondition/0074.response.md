Output State: **`max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`. Otherwise, `max_sum` remains unchanged; `best_y` is `x - 1`; the `results` list now contains 1; `gcd_val` is unchanged; `x` is the next value from `test_cases`; `y` is `x - 2`; `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`.**

Explanation: The code updates `current_sum` to `gcd_val + y`. Since `y` is defined as `x - 2`, we can express `current_sum` as `gcd_val + (x - 2)`. The other variables (`max_sum`, `best_y`, `results`, `gcd_val`, `x`, and `y`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
