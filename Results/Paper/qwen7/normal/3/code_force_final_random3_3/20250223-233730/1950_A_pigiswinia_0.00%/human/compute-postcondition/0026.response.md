Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned from the input split, and the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are specific integers based on user input.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are specific integers based on the user's input, but their exact values are not specified in the initial state.
