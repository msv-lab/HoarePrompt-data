Reasoning:
1. The function `func()` correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It then iterates over each test case, reading three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) for each case.
3. The conditions for determining whether the digits form a stair or a peak are correctly implemented:
   - For a stair: `if a < b < c`, it prints "STAIRS".
   - For a peak: `elif a < b > c`, it prints "PEAK".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NONE".
4. The logic follows the problem statement accurately and handles all possible cases as described.
5. The function does not return anything but prints the results directly, which matches the requirement since no return value is specified in the problem.

Given this analysis, the program is correct according to the problem description and the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
