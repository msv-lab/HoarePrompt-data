### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Input**: For each test case, it correctly reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.
3. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIRS' if this condition is met.
   - It checks if `a < b > c` and prints 'PEAK' if this condition is met.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints 'NONE'.
4. **Output Format**: The output format matches the problem statement, with each test case's result printed on a new line.

Given that the program follows the logic correctly as per the problem description, there are no errors in the implementation.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is correct based on the provided problem description.
