Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `a`, `b`, and `c` are all equal. According to the problem description, if `a == b == c`, the output should be "NONE". However, the current implementation will print "STAIRS" or "PEAK" in such cases, which is incorrect. For example, if the input is `0 0 0`, the program will output "STAIRS" instead of "NONE".
