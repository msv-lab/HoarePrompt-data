Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, s is a list of characters from the input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.**

Explanation: The code `s = list(input())` takes an input from the user, converts it into a list of characters, and assigns it to the variable `s`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as the code does not modify its value. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, and `s` now holds a list of characters from the input string.
