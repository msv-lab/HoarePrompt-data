You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each testcase, s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 5000. The total length of all strings s does not exceed 5000.
def func_1():
    s = list(input())
    n = len(s)
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        count = 0
        
        for k in range(0, n - j):
            if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 0
            if count == j:
                print(count * 2)
                return
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, and the output state is as follows:
    #
    #- `n` remains the same as its initial value, `N`.
    #- `j` is set to `J - 1` after the last iteration of the outer loop.
    #- `count` reflects the total number of times the conditions `s[k] == '?'`, `s[k + j] == '?'`, or `s[k] == s[k + j]` were true across all iterations of the loop. It is reset to 0 whenever it reaches `j`, at which point `count * 2` is printed and the function returns, effectively stopping the loop.
    #- The list `s` and the initial value of `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has run through all possible values of `j` starting from `n // 2` down to 1, `count` will hold the maximum value it reached before the loop terminated, and this value will have been doubled and printed. The value of `j` will be one less than the final value it took during the last iteration of the loop.
    print(0)
    #This is printed: 0
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts no parameters. It may return `None`, count which is 2, k which is 1, and n which is greater than j, or count which is 3, depending on the internal logic of the function. If there is no return statement, it does not return any value.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program does not return any value since there is no return statement in the provided code.

Case_2: The program does not return any value since there is no return statement in the provided code.

Case_3: The program returns None

Case_4: The program returns None

Case_5: The program returns count which is 2, k which is 1, and n which is greater than j.

Case_6: The program returns count which is 3

Case_7: The program does not return anything as there is no return statement in the given code.

Case_8: The program does not return any value.

Case_9: The program does not return anything since there is no return statement in the provided code snippet.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
