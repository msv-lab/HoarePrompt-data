Step-by-step reasoning:

1. From the initial state, we know:
   - `count` is equal to `j`.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than `j`.

2. The code snippet to be executed is:
   ```python
   print(count * 2)
   ```

3. Since `count` is equal to `j`, we can replace `count` with `j` in the expression `count * 2`:
   - The expression becomes `j * 2`.

4. Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `j * 2`.

Output: **j * 2**
