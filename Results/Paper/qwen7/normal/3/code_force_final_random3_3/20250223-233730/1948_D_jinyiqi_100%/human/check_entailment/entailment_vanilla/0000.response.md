Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The function `func_1()` is called for each test case.
   - Inside `func_1()`, the string `s` is converted to a list of characters.
   - The length of the string `n` is calculated.

3. **Finding Longest Tandem Repeat:**
   - The program iterates over possible lengths of tandem repeats from the largest possible (half the length of the string) down to 1.
   - For each possible length `j`, it checks all possible starting positions `k` in the string.
   - It counts how many characters match the condition for a tandem repeat (either both characters are the same or one is a question mark).
   - If a full tandem repeat of length `j` is found (`count == j`), it prints the length of this tandem repeat and returns immediately.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If no tandem repeat is found after checking all possible lengths, it prints `0`.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Handling of Question Marks:**
   - The program correctly handles question marks by considering them as potentially matching any character.
   - This ensures that the longest possible tandem repeat is considered when replacing question marks.

2. **Iterative Approach:**
   - The program iterates from the largest possible tandem repeat length down to 1, which is an efficient approach to find the longest tandem repeat.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where no tandem repeat is possible by printing `0`.

4. **Input Validation:**
   - The program does not explicitly validate the input constraints (e.g., length of the string, number of test cases), but it adheres to the problem requirements within the given constraints.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat after replacing each question mark with a lowercase Latin letter.

**Correctness: True**
