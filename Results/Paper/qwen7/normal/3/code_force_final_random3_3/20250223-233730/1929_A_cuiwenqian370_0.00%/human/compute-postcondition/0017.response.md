Output State: **`left` is 1, `right` must be greater than or equal to 1, `new_arr` contains the element `arr[right]`**

Explanation: The code appends the element `arr[right]` to the list `new_arr`. Since `left` and `right` are not directly modified, their initial conditions remain unchanged. The only new information is that `new_arr` now includes the element from `arr` at the index specified by `right`.
