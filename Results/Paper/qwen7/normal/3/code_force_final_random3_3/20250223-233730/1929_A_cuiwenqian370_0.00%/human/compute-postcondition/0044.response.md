Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `arr` of `n` integers (each integer in the range 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9). It returns `max_beauty`, which is increased by the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements from index 1 to `left + 1` in the `new_arr` list, where `i` is equal to `n` (which is `left + 1`), and the values of `left`, `right`, and `new_arr` remain unchanged.**
