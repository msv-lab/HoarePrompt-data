Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Current Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - `n` is `left + 1`.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
   - Given `i` is currently 3, for the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 3.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, the new value of `i` will be 4.
   - For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 4 (since `i` must be less than `n`).

5. **Final State:**
   - `max_beauty` is not directly affected by the loop head, so it remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
   - `i` is now 4.
   - `n` must be greater than 4.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`max_beauty` is increased by the absolute difference between `new_arr[2]` and `new_arr[1]`, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4**
