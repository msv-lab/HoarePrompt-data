Postcondition: `arr` is a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `new_arr` is a list containing either one element which is the integer at index 0 of `arr`, or two elements where the first element is `arr[left]` and the second element is `arr[right]`, depending on whether `left` is equal to `right` or not. `left` is 0, `right` is n - 1.
