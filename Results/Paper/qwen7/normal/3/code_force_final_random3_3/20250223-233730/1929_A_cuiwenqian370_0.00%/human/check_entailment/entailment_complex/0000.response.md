Reasoning:

The given program aims to find the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements starting from the second element. The program correctly sorts the array and then constructs a new array by appending elements from the ends of the sorted array towards the center, effectively reversing the order of the elements. This approach ensures that the largest and smallest elements are placed at opposite ends, maximizing the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Array Sorting and Rearrangement**:
   - The array is sorted.
   - A new array (`new_arr`) is constructed by appending elements from the ends of the sorted array towards the center.
3. **Calculating Maximum Beauty**:
   - The maximum beauty is calculated by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the newly constructed array.
4. **Output**: The result is printed for each test case.

Given the problem statement and the provided example, the program correctly implements the logic to achieve the maximum beauty of the array by rearranging its elements.

Correctness: **True**
