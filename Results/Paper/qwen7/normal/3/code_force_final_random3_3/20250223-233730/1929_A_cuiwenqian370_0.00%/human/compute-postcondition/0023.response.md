Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `left <= right`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `left` is 2
   - `right` is 0

3. **Determine if the Loop Can Execute Again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, the condition `left <= right` must be true.
   - Given that `left` is 2 and `right` is 0, the condition `left <= right` is false.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since the current values of `left` and `right` do not satisfy the loop condition, we need to adjust these values so that the condition becomes true.
   - We can either increase `right` or decrease `left` (or both) to make `left <= right` true.

5. **Possible Adjustments**:
   - Increasing `right` to at least 2 would satisfy the condition.
   - Decreasing `left` to at most 0 would also satisfy the condition.
   - However, since `left` is already 2, decreasing `left` is not a feasible option without additional information.

6. **Final Adjustment**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to set `right` to at least 2.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `right` to be at least 2.

**State**: **`left` is 2, `right` must be at least 2**
