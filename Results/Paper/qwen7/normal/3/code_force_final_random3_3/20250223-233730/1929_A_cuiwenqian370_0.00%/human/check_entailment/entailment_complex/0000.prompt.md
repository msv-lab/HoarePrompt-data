Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(n, arr)
    results.append(result)
for result in results:
    print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and arr is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, arr):
    arr.sort()
    new_arr = []
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    while left <= right:
        if left == right:
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        else:
            new_arr.append(arr[right])
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        
        left += 1
        
        right -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `left` is `n - 1`, `right` is 1, and `new_arr` is a list containing all elements from `arr` but in reverse order.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `left` will be equal to `right + 1`, which means `left` will be `n - 1` and `right` will be 1. During each iteration, the loop appends elements from the ends towards the center of the original array `arr` into `new_arr`. Therefore, `new_arr` will contain all elements of `arr` in reverse order.
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_beauty += abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])
        
    #State: Output State: `max_beauty` is increased by the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements from index 1 to `left + 1` in the `new_arr` list, `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is equal to `left + 1`, and the values of `left`, `right`, and `new_arr` remain unchanged.
    #
    #To break it down further:
    #- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n-1` (where `n` is initially `left + 1`), adding the absolute difference between `new_arr[i]` and `new_arr[i - 1]` to `max_beauty`.
    #- After all iterations, `max_beauty` will contain the total sum of these absolute differences.
    #- The values of `left`, `right`, and `new_arr` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.
    #- `i` will be equal to `n` after the last iteration, which is `left + 1`.
    #- `n` will also be equal to `left + 1` after the loop completes.
    return max_beauty
    #The program returns max_beauty which is increased by the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements from index 1 to left + 1 in the new_arr list, where i is equal to n (which is left + 1), and the values of left, right, and new_arr remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `arr` of `n` integers (each integer in the range 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9). It sorts the list `arr` and then creates a new list `new_arr` by appending elements from the ends of `arr` towards the center, resulting in `new_arr` containing all elements of `arr` in reverse order. Finally, it calculates `max_beauty` as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements from index 1 to `left + 1` in `new_arr`, where `left` is `n - 1`, and returns `max_beauty`. The values of `left`, `right`, and `new_arr` remain unchanged after the function execution.
