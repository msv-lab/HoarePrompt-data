Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array (`n`) and the array itself (`arr`).
3. The `func_1` function is responsible for rearranging the array to maximize the beauty.
4. In `func_1`, the array is sorted, and then elements are appended to `new_arr` in a reverse order pattern (from the largest to the smallest).
5. The beauty is calculated by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the newly formed array.
6. The logic in `func_1` ensures that the array is rearranged in a way that maximizes the beauty, as the largest and smallest elements are placed next to each other, leading to the highest possible absolute differences.

Given the problem statement and the provided example, the approach taken in the `func_1` function is correct. It sorts the array and then pairs the largest and smallest remaining elements to maximize the sum of absolute differences.

Correctness: **True**
