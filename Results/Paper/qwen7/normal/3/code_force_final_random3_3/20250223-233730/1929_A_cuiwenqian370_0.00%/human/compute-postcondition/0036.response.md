Output State: **`max_beauty` is increased by the absolute difference between `new_arr[i]` and `new_arr[i - 1]`, `i` is 1, `n` is `left + 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the `max_beauty` variable by adding the absolute difference between `new_arr[i]` and `new_arr[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the subtraction `new_arr[i - 1]` refers to `new_arr[0]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
