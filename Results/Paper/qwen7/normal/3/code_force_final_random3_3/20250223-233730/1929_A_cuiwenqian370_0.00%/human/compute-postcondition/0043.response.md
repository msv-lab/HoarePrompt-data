Output State: **The program returns max_beauty which is increased by the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements from index 1 to left + 1 in the new_arr list, where i is equal to n (which is left + 1), and the values of left, right, and new_arr remain unchanged.**

This means that `max_beauty` has been updated to include the sum of the absolute differences between each pair of consecutive elements in the `new_arr` list from index 1 to `left + 1`. After the loop completes, `i` and `n` both equal `left + 1`, and `max_beauty` holds the accumulated sum of those absolute differences. The values of `left`, `right`, and `new_arr` remain as they were before the loop.
