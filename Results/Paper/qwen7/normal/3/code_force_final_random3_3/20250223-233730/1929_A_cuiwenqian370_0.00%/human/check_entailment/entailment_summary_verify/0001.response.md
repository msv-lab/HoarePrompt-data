### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of (a_i - a_{i-1}) for all i from 2 to n. This means we want to maximize the differences between consecutive elements.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array elements.
   - It then calls a function `func_1` to compute the maximum beauty of the array.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function sorts the array `arr`.
   - It creates a new array `new_arr` where the smallest and largest elements are alternated to maximize the differences between consecutive elements.
   - Finally, it calculates the beauty of the new array by summing up the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest and largest values are placed at the extremes, maximizing the differences.
   - Alternating the smallest and largest values (starting with the smallest) ensures that the differences are maximized.
   - Summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the new array gives the maximum possible beauty.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of the `func_1` function. Specifically, the function does not correctly alternate the smallest and largest values. Instead, it alternates the elements from the end of the sorted array towards the center, which does not necessarily maximize the differences between consecutive elements.

To illustrate, consider the following example:
- Input: `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`
- Sorted array: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
- `new_arr` after alternating: `[43, 100, 54, 90, 80]`

The differences calculated would be:
- \(|100 - 43| + |54 - 100| + |90 - 54| + |80 - 90| = 57 + 46 + 36 + 10 = 149\)

But the optimal arrangement to maximize the beauty would be:
- `[43, 100, 54, 80, 90]`
- Differences: \(|100 - 43| + |54 - 100| + |80 - 54| + |90 - 80| = 57 + 46 + 26 + 10 = 139\)

This shows that the current implementation does not always produce the maximum possible beauty.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was inaccurate because the function `func_1` does not correctly alternate the smallest and largest values to maximize the differences. Therefore, the code may not produce the correct maximum beauty for some inputs.

**Final: False**
