Output State: `left` is `n - 1`, `right` is 1, and `new_arr` is a list containing all elements from `arr` but in reverse order.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `left` will be equal to `right + 1`, which means `left` will be `n - 1` and `right` will be 1. During each iteration, the loop appends elements from the ends towards the center of the original array `arr` into `new_arr`. Therefore, `new_arr` will contain all elements of `arr` in reverse order.
