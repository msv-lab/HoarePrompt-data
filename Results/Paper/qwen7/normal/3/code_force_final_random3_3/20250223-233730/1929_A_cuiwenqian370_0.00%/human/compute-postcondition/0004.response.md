Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `left <= right`.
2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `arr` is a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - `new_arr` is an empty list.
   - `left` is 0.
   - `right` is n - 1.

3. **Determine if the loop can execute the first time**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `left <= right` must be true.
   - Currently, `left` is 0 and `right` is n - 1.
   - Since `0 <= n - 1` is always true for any valid positive integer `n`, the loop can indeed execute the first time based on the current values of `left` and `right`.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - No adjustments are necessary because the loop condition `left <= right` is already satisfied with the given values of `left` and `right`.

Therefore, the state right before the loop remains unchanged.

**Answer**:
State: **`arr` is a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `new_arr` is an empty list, `left` is 0, `right` is n - 1**
