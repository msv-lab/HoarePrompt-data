Output State: **`left` is `n - 1`, `right` is 1, and `new_arr` is a list containing all elements from `arr` but in reverse order, and `max_beauty` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `max_beauty` to 0 but does not perform any operations that would change the values of `left`, `right`, or `new_arr`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The `new_arr` remains a reversed version of `arr`, and `max_beauty` remains 0 after the assignment.
