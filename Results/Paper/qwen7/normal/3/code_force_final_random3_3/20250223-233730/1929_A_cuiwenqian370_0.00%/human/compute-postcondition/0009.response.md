Output State: **`arr` is a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `new_arr` is a list containing one element which is arr[right], `left` is 0, `right` is n - 1, and `left` is not equal to `right`.**

Explanation: The code appends the element at index `right` of the list `arr` to the list `new_arr`. Since `right` is initially `n - 1`, `new_arr` now contains one element, which is `arr[n-1]`. The values of `left` and `right` remain unchanged, and the condition that `left` is not equal to `right` is still true.
