Output State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to at least 0 excluding the value of `v3` and `v3`, `ops` is a list containing either one tuple `(v1, v2)` or two tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]` plus an additional tuple `(v1, v2)` or three tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0), (v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`, `p1` is a list containing the first element of the updated `vx` and an empty list, `v1` is an integer equal to `len(vx) - 2`, `v2` is an integer equal to `len(vx) - 2` and is greater than 0 unless the else part is executed, in which case `v2` is less than or equal to 0, `v3` is the result of `q(0)` and has been removed from `vx` if the else part is executed, and `len(vx)` is now `len(vx) - 1`. `v3` is no longer in `vx`.**

This means that `v3` has been removed from the set `vx`, and all other variables retain their previous conditions except for `len(vx)` which is now reduced by 1.
