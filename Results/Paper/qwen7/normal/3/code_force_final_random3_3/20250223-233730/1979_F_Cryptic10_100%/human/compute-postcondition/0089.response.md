Output State: **`vx` must contain at least 3 elements, `ops` is an empty list, `p1` is an empty set, `p2` is an empty set, `v1` is the second last element of `vx`, `v2` is the last element of `vx`**.

Explanation: The code `v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)` extracts the second last (`len(vx) - 2`) and last elements from the list `vx` and assigns them to `v1` and `v2` respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.
