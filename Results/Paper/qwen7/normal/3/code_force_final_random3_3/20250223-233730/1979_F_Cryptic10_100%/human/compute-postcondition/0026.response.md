Output State: **`vx` has at least 2 elements, `v1` is removed from `vx`, `v2` is the new second last element of `vx`, and `ops` is a list containing two tuples. If `v2` is greater than 0, then `v3` is equal to `v2`, otherwise `v3` is equal to 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `v3, _ = q(0)` assigns the first element of the tuple returned by `q(0)` to `v3` and ignores the second element.
- The function `q(0)` returns a tuple where the first element depends on whether `v2` is greater than 0 or not.
- If `v2` is greater than 0, the tuple is (`v2`, `v2`), so `v3` is set to `v2`.
- If `v2` is not greater than 0 (i.e., `v2` is 0 or less), the tuple is (0, 0), so `v3` is set to 0.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
