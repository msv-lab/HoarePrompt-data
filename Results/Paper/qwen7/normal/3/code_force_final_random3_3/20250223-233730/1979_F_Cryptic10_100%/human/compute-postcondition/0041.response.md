Output State: `vx` remains a set containing exactly 2 elements, which are the last two integers from the original set from 1 to `n`; `p1` is a list containing the first element of `vx` and an empty list; `p2` is a list containing all the elements that were appended during the loop iterations.

Explanation: Since the loop runs through all elements in `ops` in reverse order, each iteration appends an element to either `p1` or `p2` based on the condition `p1[-1] == v2`. After all iterations, `p2` will contain all the elements that were appended throughout the loop, and `p1` will still contain the first element of `vx` followed by an empty list, as it was not modified by any append operations during the loop.
