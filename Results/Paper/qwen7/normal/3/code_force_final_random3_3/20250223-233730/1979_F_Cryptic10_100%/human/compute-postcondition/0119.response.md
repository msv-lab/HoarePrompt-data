Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `(v1, v2)` which are unpacked from the tuples in the `ops` list. Additionally, the loop iterates over `ops[::-1]`, meaning it starts from the last tuple in `ops` and goes backwards.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `ops`**: Since the loop iterates over `ops[::-1]`, the initial state of `ops` must contain at least one tuple. This ensures that there is at least one iteration of the loop.

3. **Initial State of `v1` and `v2`**: For the loop to start, the first tuple in `ops[::-1]` (which is actually the last tuple in `ops`) must be unpacked into `v1` and `v2`.

4. **State of `vx` and `p1`**: The problem states that `vx` has exactly 2 elements remaining, and `p1` is a list containing the elements of `vx`. These states do not directly affect the loop's execution but are part of the overall program state.

5. **State of `p2`**: `p2` is an empty list, which is fine as it doesn't impact the loop's execution.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `ops` has at least one tuple, and the first tuple in `ops[::-1]` is unpacked into `v1` and `v2`.

**Final State Adjustment**:
- `ops` must have at least one tuple.
- The first tuple in `ops[::-1]` should be unpacked into `v1` and `v2`.

So, the state adjustments needed are:

State: **`ops` must have at least one tuple, `v1` is the first element of the last tuple in `ops`, `v2` is the second element of the last tuple in `ops`**
