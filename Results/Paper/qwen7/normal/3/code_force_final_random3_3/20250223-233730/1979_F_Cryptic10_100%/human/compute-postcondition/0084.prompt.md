Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `vx` is an empty set, `ops` is a list of operations performed during the loop, `p1` is an empty set and an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for v1, v2 in ops[::-1]:
    (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `vx` is an empty set, `ops` is a list that must have at least one element, `v1` and `v2` are the first tuple in `ops`, and (p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1) is appended with v1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `vx` is an empty set, `ops` is a list that must have at least two elements, `v1` and `v2` are the second tuple in the list `ops`, and the first element of `p1` (which is the first tuple in `ops`) has its last element replaced by `v1` if the last element of `p1` equals `v2`, otherwise `p1` appends `v1` to itself.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `vx` is an empty set, `ops` is a list with at least two elements, `p2` is the first tuple in `ops` if the last element of the first tuple equals `v2`, otherwise the first tuple in `ops` appends `v1` to itself and `p1` remains unchanged, `v1` and `v2` are the first tuple in the list `ops`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
