Output State: **`vx` has at least 2 elements, `ops` contains two elements `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`, `p1` is an empty set, `p2` is an empty set, `v1` is the third last element of `vx`, `v2` is the second last element of `vx`, `v3` is the result of calling `q(0)`, `vx` does not contain the element `v3`.**

Explanation:
- `ops` is updated to include the tuple `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`.
- `vx` has its element `v3` removed.
- All other variables (`p1`, `p2`, `v1`, `v2`, `v3`) retain their original values or conditions as specified in the initial state.
