Output State: **`vx` has at least 2 elements, `ops` is a list containing either one tuple `(v1, v2)` where `v2 > 0` or two tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` where `v3` is the result of calling `q(0)`, `p1` and `p2` are both empty sets, `v1` is now the fourth last element of `vx`, `v2` is now the third last element of `vx`, `v3` is the result of calling `q(0)`.**

Explanation: The code `v3, _ = q(0)` assigns the result of `q(0)` to `v3` and ignores the second value returned by `q(0)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
