Output State: `vx` is an empty set, `ops` is an empty list, `p1` is an empty set and an empty list, and `p2` is the last tuple in `ops` if the last element of the last tuple in `ops` equals the second last element of `ops`, otherwise `p1` appends all `v1` values from `ops` to itself.

Explanation: After the loop executes all iterations, `vx` remains an empty set as it was never modified within the loop. The `ops` list becomes empty because we are iterating over `ops[::-1]` and consuming its elements. `p1` starts as an empty set and list, and `p2` starts as an empty set and list. For each iteration, `p2` is updated based on the condition `(p2 if p1[-1] == v2 else p1).append(v1)`. If the last element of `p1` equals `v2`, then `p2` is used; otherwise, `p1` appends `v1` to itself. By the end of the loop, `p2` will hold the last tuple from `ops` if the last element of that tuple equals the second last element of `ops`; otherwise, `p1` will contain all `v1` values from `ops`.
