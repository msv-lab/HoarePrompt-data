Output State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to n-2 excluding `v1`, `v1` is now `v2`, `v2` is the new second last element of `vx`, and `ops` is a list containing two tuples (`v2`, `v2`) and (`v1`, `v2`).**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(v1, v2)` to the list `ops`. Initially, `ops` contained one tuple `(v2, v2)`. After executing the code, `ops` now contains two tuples: `(v2, v2)` and `(v1, v2)`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
