Output State: **`vx` has at least 2 elements (since one element was removed), `ops` is an empty list, `p1` is an empty set, `p2` is an empty set, `v1` is the third last element of `vx`, `v2` is the second last element of `vx`.**

Explanation: The code removes the second last element of `vx` (which was stored in `v1`) from `vx`. Now, `vx` has at least 2 elements (previously it had at least 3). The values of `ops`, `p1`, `p2`, `v1`, and `v2` are updated according to the changes in `vx`. Specifically, `v1` now refers to the third last element of `vx`, and `v2` refers to the new second last element of `vx`.
