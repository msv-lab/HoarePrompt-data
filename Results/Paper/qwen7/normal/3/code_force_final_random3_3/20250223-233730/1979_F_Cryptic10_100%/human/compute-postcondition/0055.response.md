Postcondition: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to at least 2, `ops` is a list containing either one tuple `(v1, v2)` or two tuples `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`, `p1` is a list containing the first element of the updated `vx` and an empty list, `v1` is an integer equal to `len(vx) - 2`, `v2` is an integer equal to `len(vx) - 2`, and `v2` is greater than 0 unless the else part is executed, in which case `v2` is less than or equal to 0.**
