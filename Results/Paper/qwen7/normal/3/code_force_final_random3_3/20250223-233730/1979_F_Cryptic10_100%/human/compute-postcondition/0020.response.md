Output State: **`vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to n-2 excluding `v2`, `v1` is now `v2`, `v2` is the new second last element of `vx`, `v3` is 0, `ops` is a list containing two tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`**.

Explanation: The code `ops += [(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]` appends two tuples to the list `ops`. Since `v3` is 0 and `v1` is `v2`, the list `ops` now contains the tuples `(0, 0)` and `(v2, 0)`. The values of `vx`, `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` remain unchanged from their initial states.
