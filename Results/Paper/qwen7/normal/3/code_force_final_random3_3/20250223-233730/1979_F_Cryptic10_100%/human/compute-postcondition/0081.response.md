Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the tuple `(v1, v2)` which is iterated over from the reversed list `ops[::-1]`.

2. **Understand the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `vx` is an empty set.
   - `ops` is a list that must have at least two elements.
   - `v1` and `v2` are the second tuple in the list `ops`.
   - The first element of `p1` (which is the first tuple in `ops`) has its last element replaced by `v1` if the last element of `p1` equals `v2`, otherwise `p1` appends `v1` to itself.

3. **Determine the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `ops[::-1]`, the next tuple to be processed would be the first tuple in the original `ops` list (i.e., the last tuple in the reversed list).
   - Therefore, `v1` and `v2` for the next iteration will be the first tuple in `ops`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `vx` remains unchanged as it is not involved in the loop head.
   - `ops` remains the same list, but now `v1` and `v2` will refer to the first tuple in `ops`.
   - The condition for modifying `p1` (the first tuple in `ops`) will be checked based on the new values of `v1` and `v2`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`vx` is an empty set, `ops` is a list that must have at least two elements, `v1` and `v2` are the first tuple in the list `ops`, and the first element of `p1` (which is the first tuple in `ops`) has its last element replaced by `v1` if the last element of `p1` equals `v2`, otherwise `p1` appends `v1` to itself.**
