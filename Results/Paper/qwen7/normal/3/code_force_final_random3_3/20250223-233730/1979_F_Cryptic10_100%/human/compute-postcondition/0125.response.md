Output State: **`ops` is unchanged except for the last tuple which now has its first element appended with `v1`; `v1` is the first element of the tuple before the last tuple in the reversed list; `v2` is the second element of the tuple before the last tuple in the reversed list.**

Explanation: The code checks if the last element of the tuple `p1[-1]` is equal to `v2`. If it is, then `p2` (which is the same as `p1` in this case) is used, otherwise, `p1` is used. In both cases, `v1` is appended to the tuple. Since `p2` and `p1` refer to the same tuple, appending `v1` to `p1` also appends `v1` to `p2`. The values of `v1` and `v2` remain the same as they were before the operation. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
