Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `v1` and `v2`. These are the variables that are being unpacked from the tuples in the reversed `ops` list.

2. **Understand the Iteration**: The loop iterates over the reversed `ops` list, meaning it starts from the last tuple and moves towards the first tuple.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `ops` is unchanged except for the last tuple, which now has its first element appended with `v1`.
   - `v1` is the first element of the last tuple in `ops` before the operation.
   - `v2` is the second element of the last tuple in `ops` before the operation.

4. **Determine the Next Tuple**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over the reversed list, the next tuple to be processed would be the tuple that was the second-to-last tuple in the original list before the last tuple was modified.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `v1` will be the first element of this new last tuple (which was the second-to-last tuple in the original list).
   - `v2` will be the second element of this new last tuple (which was the second-to-last tuple in the original list).

6. **Formulate the New State**:
   - The `ops` list remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, except for the last tuple which has been modified.
   - The new `v1` will be the first element of the second-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list.
   - The new `v2` will be the second element of the second-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: `ops` is unchanged except for the last tuple which now has its first element appended with `v1`; `v1` is the first element of the second-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list; `v2` is the second element of the second-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list.**
