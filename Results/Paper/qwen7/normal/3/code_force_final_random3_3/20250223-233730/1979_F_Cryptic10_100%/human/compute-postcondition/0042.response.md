Output State: `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 elements, which are the last two integers from the original set from 1 to `n`; `p1` is a list containing the first element of `vx` and an empty list; `p2` is a list containing all the elements from `ops` that were appended based on the condition (`p2` if `p1[-1] == v2 else `p1`).append(`v1`).

In this final state, after all iterations of the loop have executed, `vx` remains unchanged as it was initialized and not modified within the loop. The variable `p1` retains its initial structure with the first element of `vx` and an empty list. The variable `p2` collects all the elements that were appended according to the condition specified in the loop body, effectively accumulating all `v1` values that met the condition over all iterations.
