Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Cliques**: The function `func_1` calculates the number of cliques using `ceil(n / k)`, but this does not guarantee that the graph will be partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques. The logic for determining the number of cliques and how to distribute the vertices among these cliques needs to be more precise.

2. **Incorrect Assignment of Values to Vertices**: The function `make_array` is called incorrectly in `func_1`. It should be called to fill the array `arr` and the corresponding `cliquess` array. However, the current implementation of `make_array` does not correctly handle the assignment of values to the array `arr`.

3. **Lack of Proper Logic for Edge Condition**: The condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` is not properly checked to ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques. The logic to assign values to `a_i` and `cliquess` needs to be refined to meet this condition.

4. **Incomplete Implementation**: The function `make_array` is not correctly implemented to handle the distribution of vertices into cliques based on the given constraints.

To solve this problem correctly, a more detailed approach is needed to ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques while satisfying the given edge condition. The current implementation does not address these requirements adequately.
