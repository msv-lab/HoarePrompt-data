Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: All elements from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` in the array `arr` are set to values starting from `small_element` and incrementing by 1 for each subsequent element; `cliquess` at indices from `left` to `left + mid - 1` are all set to the value `clique`. The variable `mid` remains greater than 0 after the loop completes, indicating that there were enough elements to iterate over according to the initial conditions.

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, the array `arr` will have its elements from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` filled with values starting from `small_element` up to `small_element + mid - 1`, and the corresponding indices in the `cliquess` array will all be set to the `clique` identifier.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(not_mid):
    arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
    cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `not_mid` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is set to `clique`; `arr[left + mid + i]` is set to `big_element - i`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `not_mid` must be greater than 0; `i` is 3; `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique`; `arr[left + mid + 2]` is `big_element - 2`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `not_mid` must be greater than 0; `i` is 3; `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique`; `arr[left + mid + 4]` is `big_element - 4`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
