Output State: **`not_mid` must be greater than 0; `i` is 4; `arr[left + mid + 4]` is `big_element - 4`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `big_element - i` (which is `big_element - 4`) to the element in the array `arr` at the index `left + mid + i`. Since `i` is 4, the index becomes `left + mid + 4`. The value of `not_mid` remains greater than 0, and the value of `i` is updated to 4.
