Output State: The array `arr` will have its elements from index `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1` filled with values starting from `big_element - 1` down to `big_element - not_mid + 1`, and the corresponding indices in the `cliquess` array will all be set to the `clique` identifier.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the elements in `arr` from `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1` will contain values ranging from `big_element - 1` to `big_element - not_mid + 1` in descending order. The `cliquess` array will have the same `clique` value for these indices as well.
