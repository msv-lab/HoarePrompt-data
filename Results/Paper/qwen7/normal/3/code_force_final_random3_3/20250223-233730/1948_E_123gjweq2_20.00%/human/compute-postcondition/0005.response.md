Output State: **`mid` must be greater than 0; `arr[left + i]` is equal to `small_element + i`**

Explanation: The code updates the element at the index `left + i` in the array `arr` to be the value of `small_element + i`. The precondition that `mid` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged, and the value of `arr[left + i]` is now `small_element + i`.
