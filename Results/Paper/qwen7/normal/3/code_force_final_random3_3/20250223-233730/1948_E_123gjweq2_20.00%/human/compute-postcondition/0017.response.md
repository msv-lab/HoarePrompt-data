Output State: **`not_mid` must be greater than 0; `i` is 1; `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is set to `clique`; `arr[left + mid + i]` is set to `big_element - i`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `clique` to `cliquess[left + mid + i]`. Given that `i` was initially 0, after executing `i += 1`, `i` becomes 1. The value of `arr[left + mid + i]` remains unchanged as it was set to `big_element - i` before. The conditions and values of `not_mid` and `cliquess[left + mid + i]` are updated accordingly.
