Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is supposed to handle the main logic of the problem.
   - It calculates the number of cliques needed using `ceil(n / k)` and initializes arrays `arr` and `cliquess` of size `n`.

2. **Initialization of Cliques**:
   - The function iterates over the range of `cliques`.
   - For each clique, it calls the `make_array` function to fill the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays.

3. **Function `make_array`**:
   - This function fills the array `arr` and `cliquess` for a specific range `[left, right]` and assigns all elements in this range to the same clique.
   - It calculates the middle point `mid` and divides the range into two parts.
   - Elements from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` are assigned to the current clique.
   - Elements from `big_element - not_mid` to `big_element - 1` are assigned to the current clique.

### Verification of Correctness

1. **Distinct Values in `arr`**:
   - The `arr` array should contain distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
   - The `make_array` function ensures that the elements in the range `[left, right]` are filled with consecutive integers starting from `small_element` and ending at `big_element`.
   - Since `small_element` and `big_element` are calculated correctly, and the ranges are properly divided, `arr` will contain distinct integers.

2. **Clique Assignment**:
   - The `cliquess` array assigns the same clique number to all elements within the range `[left, right]`.
   - This ensures that all elements in the same range belong to the same clique, and different ranges belong to different cliques.

3. **Graph Construction**:
   - The condition for adding an edge between vertices `(i, j)` is `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`.
   - Given the way `arr` is constructed, for any two elements in the same clique, the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` will hold true because they are consecutive or near-consecutive integers.

4. **Partition into Minimum Clique Number**:
   - The number of cliques is calculated as `ceil(n / k)`, which is the minimum possible number of cliques required to satisfy the condition for the given `n` and `k`.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to generate a valid assignment of integers to vertices and partitions the graph into the minimum number of cliques. Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
