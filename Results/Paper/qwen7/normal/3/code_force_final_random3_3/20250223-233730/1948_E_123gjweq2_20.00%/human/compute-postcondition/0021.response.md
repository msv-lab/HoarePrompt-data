Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(not_mid)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `not_mid`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `not_mid` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is currently 3.
   - `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is `clique`.
   - `arr[left + mid + 2]` is `big_element - 2`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < not_mid`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 4.
   - For the loop to continue, `not_mid` must still be greater than 0.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `i` will be 4.
   - `not_mid` must still be greater than 0.

6. **Consider the other states**:
   - The states involving `cliquess`, `left`, `mid`, `clique`, `arr`, and `big_element` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the updated state for the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`not_mid` must be greater than 0; `i` is 4**
