Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(mid):`.
   - The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `mid`.

2. **Determine the State After the Previous Iteration:**
   - `mid` must be greater than 0.
   - `cliquess[left + i]` is equal to `clique`.
   - `arr[left + i]` is equal to `small_element + i`.

3. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Since `i` starts from 0, after the first iteration, `i` becomes 1.
   - `mid` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise in the loop body, but it must still be greater than 0.

4. **Update the States:**
   - `mid` must still be greater than 0.
   - `cliquess[left + i]` will now be `cliquess[left + 1]` (since `i` is now 1).
   - `arr[left + i]` will now be `arr[left + 1]` (since `i` is now 1).

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`mid` must be greater than 0; `cliquess[left + 1]` is equal to `clique`; `arr[left + 1]` is equal to `small_element + 1`.**
