Output State: **`left` is an integer such that 0 <= left < right < n; `right` is an integer such that 0 <= left < right < n; `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier; `small_element` is left + 1; `big_element` is right + 1; `mid` is ((right + 1) - (left + 1)) // 2.**

This means that the variable `mid` is calculated as half the difference between `big_element` and `small_element`, which simplifies to `(right + 1) - (left + 1)` divided by 2. All other variables retain their initial conditions.
