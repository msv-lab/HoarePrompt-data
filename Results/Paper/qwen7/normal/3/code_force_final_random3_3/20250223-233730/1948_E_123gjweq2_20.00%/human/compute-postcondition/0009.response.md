Output State: **`mid` must be greater than 0; `cliquess[left + i]` is equal to `clique`; `arr[left + i]` is equal to `small_element + i`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `cliquess[left + i]` to `clique`. This means that the value of `cliquess[left + i]` is now `clique`. The other variables remain unchanged, so `mid` must still be greater than 0, and `arr[left + i]` remains equal to `small_element + i`.
