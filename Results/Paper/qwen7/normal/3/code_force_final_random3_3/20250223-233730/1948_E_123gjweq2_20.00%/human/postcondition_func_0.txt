The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 40 inclusive, and `k` is an integer between 1 and 2n inclusive. It calculates the number of cliques (`cliques`) based on `n` and `k`, and then fills an array `arr` using the `make_array` function. After filling the array, it prints the contents of `arr`, the number of cliques, and the updated `cliquess` list.
