Reasoning:
1. The problem requires us to assign distinct integers to vertices such that the graph formed by these assignments can be partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques.
2. The solution uses a function `func_1` to calculate the number of cliques and fill the arrays `arr` and `cliquess`.
3. The `make_array` function is used to populate these arrays according to the specified rules.
4. Let's verify if the logic in `func_1` and `make_array` aligns with the requirements:
   - `func_1` calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
   - It then calls `make_array` to fill the arrays `arr` and `cliquess`.
   - `make_array` correctly fills the array `arr` with values from `left` to `right` in a way that ensures the conditions for forming cliques are met.
   - The `cliquess` array is filled with the same `clique` identifier for all elements in the range, ensuring that vertices in the same range belong to the same clique.
5. Given the constraints and the logic, the approach seems to correctly generate a valid assignment of integers to vertices and partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques.

Correctness: **True**
