Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, `N` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings based on whitespace, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `a`. The initial values of `t` and `N` remain unchanged.
