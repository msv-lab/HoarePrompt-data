Postcondition: **`t` is 1, `N` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default value 0 where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `a`. If the count of `i` in `cnt` is 1, then `t` remains 1. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `N`, `a`, and `cnt` remain unchanged. The condition `(t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0)` is true.**
