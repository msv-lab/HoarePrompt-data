Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `N`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0.
   - `N` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the list `a`.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `N + 1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - For the loop to start, `i` must be 0 (which it already is).
   - `N` must be a positive integer, and since `N` represents the number of elements in the list `a`, it must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `N` must be a positive integer (at least 1).

**Final State**:
State: **`t` is 0, `N` must be a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default value 0 where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `a`**.
