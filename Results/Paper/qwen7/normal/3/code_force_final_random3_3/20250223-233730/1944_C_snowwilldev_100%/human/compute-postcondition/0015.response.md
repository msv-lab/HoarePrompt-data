Postcondition: `t` is 1, `N` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default value 0 where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `a`. If the count of `i` in `cnt` is 1, then `t` remains 1. If the count of `i` in `cnt` is not 1, then `t` remains 0.
