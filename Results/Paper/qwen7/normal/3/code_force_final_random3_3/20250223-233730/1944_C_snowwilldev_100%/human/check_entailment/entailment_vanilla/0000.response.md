Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N` and the array `a`.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - A dictionary `cnt` is used to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`.

3. **Finding the Minimum Excludant (MEX):**
   - The function `func_1()` iterates through numbers from `0` to `N`.
   - It checks if the count of any number `i` is exactly `1`. If so, it increments `t`.
   - If `t` reaches `2` or if the count of any number `i` becomes `0`, it returns `i`.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Objective:**
   - The goal is to find the MEX of the array `c` formed by the optimal moves of Alice and Bob.
   - Alice can choose elements freely, while Bob can only choose from remaining elements.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
   - To maximize the MEX, Alice should try to include as many unique numbers as possible in `c`.
   - Bob will remove elements to minimize the MEX.

3. **Algorithm Evaluation:**
   - The program counts the occurrences of each number in `a`.
   - It then iterates through numbers from `0` to `N` to find the smallest number that appears exactly once (`cnt[i] == 1`).
   - If such a number is found, it returns it immediately.
   - If no such number is found, it returns `N`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If every number in `a` appears more than once, the MEX would be `N` (since all numbers from `0` to `N-1` are covered).
   - If there is at least one number that appears exactly once, the MEX would be that number.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the array `c` under the optimal play of both players. It handles the counting and finding the smallest unique number efficiently.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
