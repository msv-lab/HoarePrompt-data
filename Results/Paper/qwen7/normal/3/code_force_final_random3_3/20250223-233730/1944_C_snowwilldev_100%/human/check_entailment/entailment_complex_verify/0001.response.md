### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the key aspects of the problem and the logic implemented in the program. However, let's break down the program and the logic step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N` and the array `a`.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - A dictionary `cnt` is used to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`. This part is correct and necessary to understand the distribution of numbers in the array.

3. **Finding the Minimum Excludant (MEX):**
   - The function `func_1()` iterates through numbers from `0` to `N`.
   - It checks if the count of any number `i` is exactly `1`. If so, it increments `t`.
   - If `t` reaches `2` or if the count of any number `i` becomes `0`, it returns `i`.

### Key Insights:

- **Objective:** The goal is to find the MEX of the array `c` formed by the optimal moves of Alice and Bob.
- **Alice's Strategy:** Alice can choose elements freely, while Bob can only choose from remaining elements.
- **Bob's Strategy:** Bob will remove elements to minimize the MEX.

### Algorithm Evaluation:

1. **MEX Calculation:**
   - The program correctly counts the occurrences of each number in `a`.
   - It then iterates through numbers from `0` to `N` to find the smallest number that appears exactly once (`cnt[i] == 1`).

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - If every number in `a` appears more than once, the MEX would be `N` (since all numbers from `0` to `N-1` are covered).
   - If there is at least one number that appears exactly once, the MEX would be that number.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Alice's Optimal Play:** Alice will always pick elements that are not yet chosen, ensuring that Bob cannot force the MEX to be lower than necessary.
- **Bob's Optimal Play:** Bob will remove elements to prevent Alice from increasing the MEX. However, since Alice can always pick the smallest available number, Bob cannot prevent the MEX from being the smallest possible value that is not already in `c`.

### Example Verification:

- **Test Case 1:** `a = [0, 0, 1, 1]`
  - Alice picks `1`, `a = [0, 0]`, `c = [1]`.
  - Bob picks `0`, `a = []`, `c = [1, 0]`.
  - MEX of `[1, 0]` is `2`.

- **Test Case 2:** `a = [0, 1, 2, 3]`
  - Alice picks `0`, `a = [1, 2, 3]`, `c = [0]`.
  - Bob picks `1`, `a = [2, 3]`, `c = [0, 1]`.
  - Alice picks `2`, `a = [3]`, `c = [0, 1, 2]`.
  - Bob picks `3`, `a = []`, `c = [0, 1, 2]`.
  - MEX of `[0, 1, 2]` is `3`.

- **Test Case 3:** `a = [1, 1]`
  - Alice picks `1`, `a = []`, `c = [1]`.
  - MEX of `[1]` is `0`.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX under optimal play, and the provided examples and edge cases confirm its correctness.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The given program correctly finds the MEX of the array `c` under optimal play of both players.
