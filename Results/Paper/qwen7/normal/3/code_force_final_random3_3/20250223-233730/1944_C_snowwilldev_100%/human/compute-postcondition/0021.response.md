Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is 1
   - `N` is a positive integer
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer
   - `cnt` is a `defaultdict` with default value 0 where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `a`.
   - The count of `i` in `cnt` is not 1
   - `t` is less than 2

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` in the range `range(N + 1)`.
   - This means `i` ranges from 0 to `N`.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `t` is less than 2 and `i` is within the range `0` to `N`.

4. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `t` is currently 1, it needs to be incremented to 2 for the loop to stop.
   - `i` needs to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.
   - `N` remains unchanged as it is a constant for the entire loop.

5. **Checking the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - After incrementing `t` to 2, the condition `t < 2` will no longer hold true, and the loop will terminate.
   - `i` will be incremented to the next value, but since `t` is already 2, the loop will not execute further.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `t` should be incremented to 2.
- `i` should be incremented to the next value (which would be 1 if `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration).

Since the exact initial value of `i` is not specified, we assume it was 0 at the end of the previous iteration (as it starts from 0 in the range `range(N + 1)`).

Therefore, the updated states are:

State: **`t` is 2, `N` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default value 0 where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `a`, the count of `i` in `cnt` is not 1, and `i` is 1**
