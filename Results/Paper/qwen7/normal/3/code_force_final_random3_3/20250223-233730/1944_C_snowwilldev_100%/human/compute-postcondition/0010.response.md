Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `N` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the list `a`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `cnt` is a defaultdict with default value 0 where each key is an integer from the list `a` and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `a`.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, the `cnt` dictionary will contain each unique integer from the list `a` as a key, and the value associated with each key will be the total count of occurrences of that integer in the list `a`.
