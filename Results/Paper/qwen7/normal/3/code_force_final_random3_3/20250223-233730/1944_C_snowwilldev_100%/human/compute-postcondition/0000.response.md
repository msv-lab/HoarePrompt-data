Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, `N` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `N = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `N`. The variable `t` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `N` and retains the initial state of `t`.
