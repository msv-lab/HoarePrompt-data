Postcondition: `j` is assigned the value of `count`, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is a character, and `count` is greater than 0. If `count2` is less than `count`, then `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` is equal to `count`, then `done` remains unchanged. If `count2` is greater than `count`, then `done` remains unchanged.
