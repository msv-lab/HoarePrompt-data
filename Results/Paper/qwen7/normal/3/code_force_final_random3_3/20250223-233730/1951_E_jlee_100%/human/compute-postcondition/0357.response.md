Postcondition: `j` is count, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is a character, `count` is greater than 0, and `done` remains unchanged. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` (which is initially set to `count`) is less than `count`, then `done` becomes True. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`, then `done` remains unchanged. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is set to `count` + 1.
