Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Handling Single Character Strings**: The code handles single-character strings incorrectly. It should always return "NO" for single-character strings since they are trivially palindromes and cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Partitioning**: The logic for determining whether a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings is flawed. The code does not correctly handle cases where the string can be split into multiple non-palindromic parts.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The code does not handle edge cases properly, such as strings with repeated characters or strings that are not palindromes but still cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        string = input().strip()
        n = len(string)
        
        # If the string length is 1, it's a palindrome and cannot be partitioned
        if n == 1:
            print("NO")
            continue
        
        # Check if the entire string is a palindrome
        if string == string[::-1]:
            print("NO")
            continue
        
        # If the string is not a palindrome, we can always partition it into two non-palindromic parts
        print("YES")
        print(2)
        print(string[:n//2], string[n//2:])
```

This corrected version checks if the string is a palindrome and handles the edge cases correctly. If the string is not a palindrome, it can always be partitioned into two non-palindromic parts, which simplifies the logic significantly.
