Postcondition: `j` is assigned the value of `count`, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is a character, `count` is greater than 0, the character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s`, and the character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to `x`, and either the current value of `count2` is greater than the current value of `count` and `done` is set to True, or there is no change in the conditions since there is no else part.
