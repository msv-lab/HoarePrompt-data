Postcondition: **`j` is 0, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `done` is `True`, `count` is greater than 0, and `count2` is either equal to `count` (if `count > 1`) or 0 (if `count <= 1`). If `count2` is less than `count`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, `count2` remains unchanged.**
