Given the initial state:
- `j` is 1
- `n` is 1
- `done` is True
- `count` is 1

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(string[:j], string[j:])`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `j` is 1
- `n` is 1

Since `n` is 1, the string `s` must have only one character because `n` represents the length of the string. Let's denote this single character as `c`.

So, the string `string` is `c`.

Now, let's evaluate the slicing operations:
- `string[:j]` will be `string[:1]`, which is just the first character `c`.
- `string[j:]` will be `string[1:]`, but since `string` only has one character, this slice will be an empty string `''`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **c '', where c is the single character in the string `s`**
