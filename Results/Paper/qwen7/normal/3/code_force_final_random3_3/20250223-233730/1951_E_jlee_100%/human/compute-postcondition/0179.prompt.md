Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is 1, `done` is `False`, the first character of the list `s` (`x`) is not equal to the last element of the list `s`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
        continue
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `j` is 0, `n` is 1, `done` is set to True, and `count` remains 0. Additionally, `count2` is either 1 or remains unchanged, depending on whether the character at index `j` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` of `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `j` is 1, `n` is 1, `done` is True, and `count` is 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is less than `count`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` equals `count`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop. If `count2` is greater than `count`, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then `count2` is set to 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `j` is 1, `n` is 1, `done` is True, `count` is 1, and `count2` is either 0 or 2. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `count` remains unchanged. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then `count2` is set to 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
