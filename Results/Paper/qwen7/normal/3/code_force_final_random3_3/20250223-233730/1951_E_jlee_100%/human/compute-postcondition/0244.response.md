Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is assigned the value of `count`.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `x` is a character.
- `count` is greater than 1.
- The character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s`.
- The character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to `x`.
- `count2` is equal to `count`.

The `print('YES')` statement will simply print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
