Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is 1, `done` is True, `count` is 1**

Explanation: The code `count = j` assigns the value of `j` (which is 1) to the variable `count`. The other variables (`done` and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the updated state includes `count` being set to `j`.
