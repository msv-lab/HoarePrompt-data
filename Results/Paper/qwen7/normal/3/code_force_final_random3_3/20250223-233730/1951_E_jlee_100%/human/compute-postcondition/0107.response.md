Output State: **`j` is 1; `n` is 1; `done` is True; `count` is 1; `count2` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop context provided in the initial state or the code snippet, the variables `j`, `n`, `done`, `count`, and `count2` remain unchanged after executing the `continue` statement.
