Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is 1, `done` is False, `count` is 1, `count2` is 2, `i` is 1, `t` is 1, `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`**.

The code `s = list(string)` converts the input string `string` into a list of its characters and assigns it to the variable `s`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
