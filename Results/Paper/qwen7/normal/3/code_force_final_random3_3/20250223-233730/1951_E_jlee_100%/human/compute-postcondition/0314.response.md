Postcondition: `j` is assigned the value of `count`, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is a character, and `count` is greater than 0. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is less than `count`, then `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `count2` is set to `count` + 1 and `done` remains unchanged.
