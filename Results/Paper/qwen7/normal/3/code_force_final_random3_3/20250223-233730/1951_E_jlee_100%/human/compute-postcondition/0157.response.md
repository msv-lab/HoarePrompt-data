Given the initial state:
- `j` is 1
- `n` is 1
- `done` is True
- `count` is 1

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement:
```python
print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
```

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Evaluate `string[:j - 1]`:**
   - Since `j` is 1, `j - 1` is 0.
   - Therefore, `string[:j - 1]` translates to `string[:0]`, which results in an empty string (`""`).

2. **Evaluate `string[j - 1:]`:**
   - Again, since `j` is 1, `j - 1` is 0.
   - Therefore, `string[j - 1:]` translates to `string[0:]`, which results in the entire string `string`.

Given that no specific value for `string` is provided, we can only describe the slices in terms of their indices.

Output: **'', string**
