Postcondition: `j` is 1, `n` is 1, `done` is True, `count` is 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `count` remains unchanged. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then either `count2` is set to 0 if it is less than `count`, or `count2` remains 2 if it equals `count`, or we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `count2` is greater than `count`.
