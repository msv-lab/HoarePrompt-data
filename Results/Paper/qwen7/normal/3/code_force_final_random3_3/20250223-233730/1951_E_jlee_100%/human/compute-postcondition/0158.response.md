Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is 1, `done` is True, `count` is 1**

Explanation: The line `done = True` simply reassigns the variable `done` to `True`. Since no other variables are affected, the values of `j`, `n`, and `count` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
