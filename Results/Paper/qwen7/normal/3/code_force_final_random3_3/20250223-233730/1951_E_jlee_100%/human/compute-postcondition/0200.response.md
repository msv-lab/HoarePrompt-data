Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `done` is False, `count` is 1, `count2` is 2, `i` is 1, `t` is 1.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified within the statement itself, the values of all variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes all the variables in their original states.
