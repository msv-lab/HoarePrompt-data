Postcondition: `j` is 1, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `done` is `True`, and `count` is 0. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition if the condition is not met.
