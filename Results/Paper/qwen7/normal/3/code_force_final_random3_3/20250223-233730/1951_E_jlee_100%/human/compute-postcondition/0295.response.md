Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is assigned the value of `count`.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `x` is a character.
- `count` is greater than 0.
- The variable `done` remains unchanged.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `j` is equal to `count`, and since `count` is greater than 0, `j` is also greater than 0.
- `string` is a sequence of characters (a string).

The slicing operation `string[:j - 1]` will extract the substring from the start of `string` up to but not including the `j - 1`th character. The slicing operation `string[j - 1:]` will extract the substring starting from the `j - 1`th character to the end of `string`.

Therefore, the print statement will output two parts of the string: one part up to the character just before the `j - 1`th character, and the other part starting from the `j - 1`th character to the end.

Output: **string[:count - 1], string[count - 1:]**
