Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and a string `s` (consisting of lowercase Latin characters with 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6). The function returns a result based on the processing of these test cases.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing an integer `t` and a string `s`. For each test case, the function processes the string `s` and performs some operation based on the integer `t`. The exact nature of the operation on the string `s` and the integer `t` is not specified here, but the function returns a result after processing each test case.
