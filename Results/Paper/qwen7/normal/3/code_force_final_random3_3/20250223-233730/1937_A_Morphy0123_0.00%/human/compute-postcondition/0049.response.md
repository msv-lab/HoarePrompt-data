Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is the input integer and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `power` is 2**.

Explanation: The variable `power` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The other variables (`t`, `n_cases`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
