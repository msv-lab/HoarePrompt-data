Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is the input integer, `i` is either 1 or 2, `n` must be greater than 4, `power` is 3**.

Explanation: The initial value of `power` is 2. After executing `power += 1`, the value of `power` is incremented by 1, making it 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
