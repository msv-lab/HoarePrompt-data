Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n_cases` is the input integer.
- `i` is either 1 or 2.
- `n` is the integer entered by the user.
- `power` is either 15 or 14.

The `print(1)` statement simply prints the integer 1. Since no other variables or values are involved in this print statement, the output is straightforward.

Output: **1**
