Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n_cases`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n_cases`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n_cases` is the input integer.
   - `i` is either 0 or 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `power` is either 15 or 14.

4. **Consider the loop behavior**:
   - If `n` is 1, `power` remains 15.
   - If `n` is greater than 32768, `i` becomes 1 and `power` becomes 14.

5. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n_cases`, the loop will continue as long as `i < n_cases`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is either 0 or 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n_cases`.

Given the above points, let's consider the possible scenarios:

- If `i` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will become 1 in the next iteration.
- If `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will remain 1 in the next iteration.

Since `i` can only be 0 or 1, and the loop will continue as long as `i < n_cases`, we need to ensure that `i` is incremented and still within the bounds of `n_cases`.

### Conclusion:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `n_cases` remains unchanged.
- `i` will be incremented by 1 (from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 2).
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `power` remains unchanged unless `n` is greater than 32768, but since we are only adjusting the states for the next iteration, we don't need to change `power` based on the given conditions.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is the input integer, `i` is either 1 or 2, `n` is an input integer, and `power` is either 15 or 14.**
