Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n_cases` is the input integer.
- `i` is either 1 or 2.
- `n` is greater than 15.
- `power` is 5.
- The condition `power == n` is true, but this condition is not relevant since `power` is explicitly given as 5.

Given that `power` is 5, the expression `2 ** power` evaluates to \(2^5\).

Therefore, the code `print(2 ** power)` will print the result of \(2^5\), which is 32.

Output: **32**
