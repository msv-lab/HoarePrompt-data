Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is the input integer, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, as does `n_cases`, and `i` remains 0. The value of `n_cases` is now known to be the integer input by the user.
