Output State: **`power` is 4, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is the input integer, `i` is either 1 or 2, `n` is greater than 15.**

Explanation: The code decrements the value of `power` by 1, changing its value from 5 to 4. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
