`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which means it will take an integer input from the user. The value of `t`, `n_cases`, `i`, and `power` remain unchanged. The output state is: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is the input integer and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is the integer entered by the user, and `power` is set to 5 if `n == 15` and `power == 5`, or `power` is set to 4 otherwise.
