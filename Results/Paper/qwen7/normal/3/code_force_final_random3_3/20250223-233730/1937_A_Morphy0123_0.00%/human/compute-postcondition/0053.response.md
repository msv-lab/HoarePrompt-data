Output State: **`power` is 4, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is the input integer and must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 8**.

Explanation: The `power` variable was incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The other variables (`t`, `n_cases`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the executed code.
