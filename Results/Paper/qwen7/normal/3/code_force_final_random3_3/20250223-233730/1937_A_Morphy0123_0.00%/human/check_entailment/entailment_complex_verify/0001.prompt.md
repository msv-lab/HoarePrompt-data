You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            while power < log2(n):
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and `power` is set to 5 if `n == 15`, otherwise `power` is 4 if `n != 15` and `n >= 16`, or `power` is at least 3 and does not equal `n` if `n < 16`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it calculates a power value based on `n` and prints the result. If `n` is 1, it prints 1. Otherwise, it finds the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to `n` and prints the value of that power.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n_cases`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.

2. **Handling Edge Case**:
   - If `n` is 1, the program directly prints `1`. This is correct because with only one element, the element at index 1 is the only element, and it will remain at index 1 after any swaps.

3. **Finding Largest Power of 2 Less Than or Equal to `n`**:
   - The program uses a loop to find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`.
   - It initializes `power` to 1.
   - It increments `power` until `2^power` is greater than `n`.
   - This logic correctly finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`.

4. **Determining the Position of 1**:
   - If `power` equals `n`, it prints `2^power`.
   - Otherwise, it decrements `power` by 1 and prints `2^power`.

### Detailed Reasoning

- **Edge Case Handling**: 
  - When `n` is 1, the program correctly outputs 1. This is the correct position of 1 in the array.

- **General Case**:
  - For larger values of `n`, the program aims to find the position of 1 after performing the swap operations.
  - The key insight here is understanding how the swap operations affect the positions of elements.
  - For example, when swapping `a_d` and `a_k` where `d` is the largest divisor of `k` (not equal to `k`), the element at position `d` moves to position `k`, and vice versa.
  - The position of 1 after all swaps can be deduced by observing the pattern in the sequence of swaps. Specifically, the position of 1 is determined by the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`.

### Example Walkthrough

- **Test Case 4**:
  - `n = 120240229`
  - The largest power of 2 less than or equal to 120240229 is \(2^{27} = 134217728\).
  - Therefore, the program correctly prints \(2^{27} = 134217728\).

- **Test Case 5**:
  - `n = 5`
  - The largest power of 2 less than or equal to 5 is \(2^2 = 4\).
  - Therefore, the program correctly prints \(2^2 = 4\).

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it correctly implements the logic to find the position of 1 in the array after performing the specified swap operations. The program handles both edge cases and general cases appropriately.
