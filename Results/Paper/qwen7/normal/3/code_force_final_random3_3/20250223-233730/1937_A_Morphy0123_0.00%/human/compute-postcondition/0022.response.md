Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is the input integer, `i` is either 0 or 1, `n` is an input integer, and `power` is either 15 or 14. If `n` equals 1, then `power` is 15. Otherwise, `power` is 14, and `i` is 1 if `n` is greater than 32768, otherwise `i` remains 0.
