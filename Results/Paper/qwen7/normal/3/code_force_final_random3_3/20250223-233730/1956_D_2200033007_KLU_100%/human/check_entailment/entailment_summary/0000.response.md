Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify that the overall logic of the program meets the requirements of the problem statement. Specifically, we need to ensure that:
1. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the maximum possible sum of the array elements after performing the allowed operations.
2. The `func_2` function correctly identifies the operations needed to achieve this maximum sum.
3. The `make_stairs` function correctly constructs the required operations to transform the array into the desired state.

Let's analyze each part:

### Function `func_1`
- The function recursively computes the maximum sum of the array elements by considering different ways to split the array and applying the operation to maximize the sum.
- The base case handles individual elements, ensuring they are at least 1.
- The recursive cases consider splitting the array and calculating the sum of the maximum values obtained from the subarrays plus the current element.
- The memoization using `res_dict` ensures that previously computed results are reused, making the function efficient.

### Function `func_2`
- This function uses the result from `func_1` to determine the exact operations needed to achieve the maximum sum.
- It handles different scenarios:
  - If the length of the subarray is 1 and the element is positive, it returns an empty list since no operation is needed.
  - If the maximum value equals the square of the length, it constructs a "stair" pattern.
  - It recursively finds the operations needed for the subarrays that contribute to the maximum value.
- The logic seems to correctly identify the necessary operations by backtracking from the maximum value calculated by `func_1`.

### Function `make_stairs`
- This function constructs the "stair" pattern by setting all elements in a segment to the same value, effectively maximizing the sum for that segment.
- It recursively ensures that the pattern is correctly formed by adjusting the array values and appending the operation to the result list.

### Overall Program Logic
- The main program calls `func_1` to get the maximum sum and `func_2` to get the operations needed.
- The operations are printed in the required format.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided functions seem to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The `func_1` function correctly computes the maximum sum, and `func_2` correctly identifies the operations needed to achieve this sum. The `make_stairs` function ensures that the operations are applied correctly to maximize the sum.

Correctness: **True**
