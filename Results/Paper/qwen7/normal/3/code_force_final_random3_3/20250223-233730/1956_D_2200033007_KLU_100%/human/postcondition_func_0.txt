The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `start_index` and `end_index`, and returns the maximum value among several possibilities. If the key `(start_index, end_index)` is already in the dictionary `res_dict`, it returns the stored value. Otherwise, it computes a value based on subproblems defined by splitting the array segment between `start_index` and `end_index`. The function ultimately stores and returns the maximum value found, either directly from the array or through recursive computations.
