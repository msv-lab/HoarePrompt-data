Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires maximizing the sum of an array by performing operations where we can set a subarray to the MEX (Minimum Excludant) of that subarray. The operations can be performed up to \(5 \times 10^5\) times.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function calculates the maximum sum achievable for a subarray from `start_index` to `end_index`.
   - It uses recursion to explore different ways to split the subarray and compute the maximum sum.
   - The base cases handle when the subarray is of length 1, ensuring the correct value is returned.
   - The function correctly handles the recursive splitting and merging of subarrays to find the maximum sum.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function generates the operations needed to achieve the maximum sum calculated by `func_1`.
   - It handles the case when the subarray length is 1 and directly returns the operation.
   - For longer subarrays, it recursively finds the operations needed to achieve the maximum sum.
   - The function correctly identifies the segments to modify and returns the necessary operations.

4. **Function `make_stairs` Analysis**:
   - This function ensures that a segment of the array forms a "stair" pattern, setting all elements in the segment to the same value.
   - It correctly identifies and modifies the segment to achieve the desired pattern.
   - The function ensures that the segment is modified to the required value to maximize the sum.

5. **Overall Program Flow**:
   - The main program calls `func_1` to get the maximum sum and then calls `func_2` to get the operations.
   - The operations are printed in the required format.
   - The logic in both functions appears to correctly implement the problem requirements.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The provided examples cover various edge cases, including arrays with all zeros, single-element arrays, and arrays with repeated elements.
   - The program handles these cases correctly, as demonstrated by the examples.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
