Postcondition: **`is_already_stairs` remains True, `j` is 2, and `i` is 0. The values of `arr[start_index + 0]`, `arr[start_index + 1]`, and `arr[start_index + 2]` are not equal to 0, 1, and 2 respectively. If `arr[start_index + i]` is equal to `i - 1`, then `i` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `i` is set to 0, `start_index` is set to 0, and `arr[0]`, `arr[1]`, and `arr[2]` are all set to 1.**
