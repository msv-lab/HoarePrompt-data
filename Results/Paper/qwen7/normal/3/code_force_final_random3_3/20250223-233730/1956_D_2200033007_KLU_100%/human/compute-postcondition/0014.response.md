Output State: `is_already_stairs` remains True, `j` is 2, and `i` is greater than 0. All elements in the array from index `start_index` to `start_index + i` must satisfy the condition that each element is equal to its respective index (i.e., `arr[start_index + j] == j` for all `j` in the range `0` to `i`). If any element does not satisfy this condition, `is_already_stairs` would have been set to `False`.
