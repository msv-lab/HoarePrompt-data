#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `start_index` and `end_index`, and returns one of the following based on the conditions checked within the function:

- An empty list if the length of the subarray is 1 and its element is less than or equal to 0.
- A list containing a single tuple `(start_index, start_index)` if the length of the subarray is 1 and its element is greater than 0.
- A list containing a single tuple `(start_index, end_index)` if the maximum value returned by `func_1(start_index, end_index)` equals the square of the length of the subarray.
- The sum of the results of `func_2(start_index, i - 1)` and `func_2(i + 1, end_index)` for some index `i` within the range `[start_index, end_index]` where the temporary value `temp_res` equals the maximum value.
- The result of `func_2(start_index + 1, end_index)` if the sum of `arr[start_index]` and the result of `func_1(start_index + 1, end_index)` equals the maximum value.
- The result of `func_2(start_index, end_index - 1)` if the sum of `arr[end_index]` and the result of `func_1(start_index, end_index - 1)` equals the maximum value.

If none of the above conditions are met, the function does not return anything.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers of length n, where 1 <= n <= 18, and start_index is an integer such that 0 <= start_index <= n - 1. The variable res is a list that will store the operations performed.

        #
        #Explanation: Given the loop continues as long as `i` is not zero and considering the output state after 3 iterations, it's clear that `i` was decremented from its initial value to 1 over these iterations. The loop sets each element from `start_index` to `start_index + i` (inclusive) to the value of `i`. Since `i` was 1 for the last iteration and remained 1 for subsequent iterations until it reached 0, all elements from `start_index` to `start_index + i` were set to 1. With `start_index` being 0 and `i` being 1 for the final iteration, `arr[0]`, `arr[1]`, and `arr[2]` are all set to 1.
        make_stairs(i - 1)
    #State: `is_already_stairs` remains True, `j` is 2, and `i` is 0. The values of `arr[start_index + 0]`, `arr[start_index + 1]`, and `arr[start_index + 2]` are not equal to 0, 1, and 2 respectively. If `arr[start_index + i]` is equal to `i - 1`, then `i` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `i` is set to 0, `start_index` is set to 0, and `arr[0]`, `arr[1]`, and `arr[2]` are all set to 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `make_stairs` checks if a segment of the array `arr` starting from `start_index` up to `start_index + i` forms a sequence where each element matches its index. If it does not form such a sequence, it modifies the array to create a "stair" pattern, setting all elements in the segment to the value of `i`. The function does not return any value.
