### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identified that the provided code does not correctly solve the problem. Let's break down the issues in detail:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function attempts to partition the subarray in a way that maximizes the sum, but it does not consider the MEX operation.
   - The approach is incorrect because it does not account for the MEX value, which is crucial for the problem. The MEX value determines the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, and setting all elements in the subarray to this value will maximize the sum.
   - The recursive approach and memoization do not align with the problem's requirement to use the MEX operation.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function is supposed to return the sequence of operations needed to achieve the maximum sum.
   - It incorrectly assumes that the maximum sum can be achieved by partitioning the array into segments and summing their contributions.
   - The logic for finding the operations is flawed because it does not correctly implement the MEX operation. It does not ensure that the MEX value is used to update the subarray.

3. **Function 3 (`make_stairs`)**:
   - This function is intended to create a "staircase" pattern, but it is not used correctly in the context of the problem.
   - The function does not correctly implement the MEX operation or the required logic to maximize the sum. It simply tries to fill the subarray with a specific value without ensuring that the MEX value is used.

### Conclusion

The provided code does not correctly implement the MEX operation and the logic to maximize the sum of the array. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**

The given program is incorrect.
