The function `make_stairs` accepts a parameter `i`. `i` is an integer representing the current index in the list `arr`. There is no return statement in the function, so it does not return anything. Therefore, the functionality of the function `make_stairs` is to accept an integer `i` and perform operations without returning any value.
