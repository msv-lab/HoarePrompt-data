Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(start_index, start_index + i + 1):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j`, `start_index`, and `i`.

2. **Determine the current values**:
   - `j` is currently 2.
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `start_index` is currently 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `j` is within the range defined by `start_index` and `start_index + i + 1`. This means the loop will continue as long as `start_index <= j < start_index + i + 1`.

4. **Calculate the upper bound of the loop**: Given `start_index = 0` and `i = 1`, the upper bound of the loop is `start_index + i + 1 = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2`.

5. **Check if the loop should continue**: Since `j` is currently 2, it is equal to the upper bound of the loop (2). Therefore, the loop will not execute again because `j` is no longer within the range `0 <= j < 2`.

6. **Adjust the states**: Since the loop will not execute again, we do not need to change the value of `j`. However, we need to ensure that the conditions for the next iteration are met. In this case, the loop will not run again, so we do not need to update `j`, but we should confirm that the other variables are correctly set.

Given that the loop will not execute again, the states remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`j` is 2, `i` is 1, `start_index` is 0, `arr[2]` is 1**
