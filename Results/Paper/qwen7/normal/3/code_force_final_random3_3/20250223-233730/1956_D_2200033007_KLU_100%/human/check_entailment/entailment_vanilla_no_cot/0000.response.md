Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Approach**: The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not seem to address the core requirement of maximizing the sum of the array elements using the allowed operations. The functions appear to be attempting to solve a different problem related to partitioning the array into subarrays and calculating some kind of value, but they do not directly implement the MEX-based operation required to maximize the sum.

2. **Lack of MEX Operation**: The problem requires finding and setting the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value for a subarray. However, there is no implementation of the MEX calculation or the operation to update the array based on the MEX value.

3. **Recursive Structure**: The recursive structure in `func_1` and `func_2` seems to be trying to find the optimal way to partition the array, but it does not correctly handle the MEX operation or updating the array values.

4. **Missing Key Operations**: There are no operations that actually change the array based on the MEX value of a subarray, which is a crucial part of the problem statement.

To correctly solve the problem, you would need to:
- Implement the MEX calculation for a given subarray.
- Use the MEX value to update the subarray.
- Track the operations performed to achieve the maximum sum.

Given these issues, the provided code does not meet the requirements of the problem, hence the correctness is **False**.
