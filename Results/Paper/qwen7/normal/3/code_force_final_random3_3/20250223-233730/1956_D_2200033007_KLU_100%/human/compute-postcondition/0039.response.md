Output State: `j` is 2, `i` is 1, `start_index` is 0, `arr[0]` is 1, `arr[1]` is 1, `arr[2]` is 1.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `i` is greater than 0. Given the initial conditions and the output states after the first three iterations, we can deduce that the loop will continue to set each element from `start_index` to `start_index + i` to the value of `i`. Since `i` is reduced by 1 each iteration and becomes 1 after the third iteration, it will continue to be 1 for the remaining iterations until it reaches 0. After the loop completes, `i` will be 0, and `arr[start_index]` through `arr[start_index + i]` will all be set to 1. Therefore, `arr[0]`, `arr[1]`, and `arr[2]` will all be 1.
