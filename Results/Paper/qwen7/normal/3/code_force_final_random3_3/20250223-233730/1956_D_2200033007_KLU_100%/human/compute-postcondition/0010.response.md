Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `i`.

2. **Determine the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `j` is less than `i + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `is_already_stairs` remains True.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `i` must be greater than 0.
   - The current value of `arr[start_index + 1]` is not equal to 0.
   - If `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j`, then the condition `is_already_stairs` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, `j` will be incremented to 2 in the next iteration.
   - `i` remains the same since it is not modified within the loop head.

5. **Check the condition for `is_already_stairs`**:
   - The condition `is_already_stairs` remains unchanged if `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j`.
   - Since `j` was 1 in the previous iteration, we need to check `arr[start_index + 2]` in the next iteration.
   - If `arr[start_index + 2]` is not equal to 2, `is_already_stairs` remains True.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are:

- `j` will be 2.
- `i` remains the same (greater than 0).
- `is_already_stairs` remains True unless `arr[start_index + 2]` is equal to 2.

However, since the postcondition specifies that `is_already_stairs` remains unchanged if `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j`, and `j` will be 2 in the next iteration, `is_already_stairs` will remain True if `arr[start_index + 2]` is not equal to 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`is_already_stairs` remains True, `j` is 2, `i` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `arr[start_index + 2]` is not equal to 0, and if `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to `j`, then the condition `is_already_stairs` remains unchanged.**
