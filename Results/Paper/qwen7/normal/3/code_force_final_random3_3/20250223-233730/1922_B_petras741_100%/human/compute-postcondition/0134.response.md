Output State: **`j` is `j + 1`, `n` is a positive integer, and `q[j]` is a value greater than 0; `eta` is a list with the value `j` appended.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `j` to the list `eta`. Since `j` is initially `j + 1`, `eta` now contains this value. The other variables (`n` and `q[j]`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
