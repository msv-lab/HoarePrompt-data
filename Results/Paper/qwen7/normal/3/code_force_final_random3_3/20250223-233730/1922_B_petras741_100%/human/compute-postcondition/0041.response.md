Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `eta_ln`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `j` is less than `eta_ln`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 2
   - `eta_ln` must be greater than 2
   - `res` is calculated based on the current values of `j`, `eta_ln`, `q`, `eta`, and `rho`
   - `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]]`

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will become 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `eta_ln` must still be greater than 3.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` is updated to 3.
   - `eta_ln` must remain greater than 3.
   - The value of `res` and `rho` do not need to be explicitly updated since they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`j` is 3, `eta_ln` must be greater than 3**
