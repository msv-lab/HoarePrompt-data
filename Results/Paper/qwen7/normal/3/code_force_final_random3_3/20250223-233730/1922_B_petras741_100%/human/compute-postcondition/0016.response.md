Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `n`.
2. **Determine the Initial State of `j` and `n`**: 
   - The variable `j` is initialized to 0 (since `range(n + 1)` starts from 0).
   - The variable `n` is not explicitly defined in the given state, but it must be a non-negative integer for the loop to execute.
3. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `j` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the initial value of `j` should be 0.
   - The value of `n` must be a non-negative integer to ensure the loop can execute.

Given the initial state where `eta` is an empty list and `q` is a list with elements updated according to the loop's execution, these variables are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need adjustment for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `j` should be 0.
- `n` must be a non-negative integer.

State: **`eta` is an empty list, `q` is a list with elements updated according to the loop's execution, `j` is 0, `n` must be a non-negative integer**
