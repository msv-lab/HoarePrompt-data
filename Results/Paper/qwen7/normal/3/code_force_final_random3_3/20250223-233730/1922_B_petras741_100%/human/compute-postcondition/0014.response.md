Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `j` will be equal to `n-1`, as the loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = n-1`. For each iteration, `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1. Therefore, `q` will have been updated `n` times, with each `q[w[j]]` being incremented exactly once for the corresponding index `w[j]`.

This means that the final state of `q` will have `q[w[0]]` incremented once, `q[w[1]]` incremented once, and so on, up to `q[w[n-1]]` incremented once. All other elements of `q` (except the first one which is always 0) will also be 0 if they were not incremented during the loop's execution.
