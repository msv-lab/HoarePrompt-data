Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `buffer` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `w` is updated to a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `eta` is a list of integers, `q` is a list where each element `q[j]` (for `j` from `0` to `n`) has been decremented by `1` for each iteration where `q[j]` was greater than `0`, `rho` is `q[1]`, `j` is `n + 1`, `n` is less than 3, `eta` is a list containing the integers `1`, `1`, and `3` only if `n` is not greater than or equal to 3, `eta_ln` is `1` if the condition `eta_ln == 1` is true, and `res` is calculated as specified.**
