Output State: The final state of `eta` will be a list containing all indices `j` from `0` to `n` (inclusive) where `q[j]` is greater than `0`.

In this final state, `eta` will include every index `j` that met the condition `q[j] > 0` during the entire execution of the loop. The value of `j` will go from `0` to `n`, and if `q[j]` is greater than `0` for any of these indices, they will be appended to the list `eta`.
