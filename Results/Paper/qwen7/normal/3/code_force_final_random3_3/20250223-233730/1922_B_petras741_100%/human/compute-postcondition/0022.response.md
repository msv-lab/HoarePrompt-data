Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop is defined as `for j in range(n + 1):`. The variables involved in this loop are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `eta` is a list containing the integer `j`.
   - `q` is a list with elements updated according to the loop's execution.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `n + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration, making `j` equal to 1.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is a non-negative integer and does not change within the loop body.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `eta` will now contain the new value of `j`, which is 1.
   - `q` remains unchanged as no information suggests it changes based on the loop incrementing `j`.
   - `j` is now 1.
   - `n` remains a non-negative integer.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**`eta` is a list containing the integer `1`, `q` is a list with elements updated according to the loop's execution, `j` is 1, and `n` is a non-negative integer.**

State: **`eta` is a list containing the integer `1`, `q` is a list with elements updated according to the loop's execution, `j` is 1, and `n` is a non-negative integer.**
