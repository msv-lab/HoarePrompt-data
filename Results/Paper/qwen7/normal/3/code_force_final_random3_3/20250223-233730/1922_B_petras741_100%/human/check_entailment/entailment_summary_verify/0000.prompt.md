You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    7
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    4
    
    3 2 1 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3
    
    1
    
    1

Output

    35
    2
    0
    0
    
Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    buffer = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]
        if n >= 3:
            q = [0 for j in range(n + 1)]
            for j in range(n):
                q[w[j]] += 1
            eta = []
            for j in range(n + 1):
                if q[j] > 0:
                    eta.append(j)
            eta_ln = len(eta)
            rho = q[eta[0]]
            if eta_ln == 1:
                print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
            else:
                res = q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6
                for j in range(1, eta_ln):
                    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
                    res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
                    rho += q[eta[j]]
                print(res)
        else:
            print(0)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 10^4), a positive integer \( n \) (1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 3⋅10^5), and a list \( a \) of \( n \) non-negative integers (0 ≤ \( a_i \) ≤ \( n \)). For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific result based on the distribution of values in the list \( a \). If \( n \) is less than 3, it prints 0. Otherwise, it computes a value related to the combinatorial arrangements of elements in \( a \) and prints this value. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the number of ways to form a non-degenerate triangle from the given sticks. Specifically, the program does not check if the chosen sticks can form a triangle (i.e., if the sum of the lengths of any two sticks is greater than the length of the third stick). Instead, it simply calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks without considering the triangle inequality theorem.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
3
1 1 1
3
2 2 2
1
1
```

The output of the program would be:
```
1
3
0
```

However, the correct output should be:
```
1
1
0
```

- For the first test case, there is only one way to choose 3 sticks of length 1, which forms a degenerate triangle (area = 0), but the problem requires a non-degenerate triangle (area > 0).
- For the second test case, there is only one way to choose 3 sticks of length 2, which also forms a degenerate triangle.
- For the third test case, there is no way to choose 3 sticks to form a triangle.

Therefore, the program does not handle the triangle inequality condition, leading to incorrect results.
