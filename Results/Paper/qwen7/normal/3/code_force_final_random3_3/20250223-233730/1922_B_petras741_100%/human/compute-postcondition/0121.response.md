Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `q` is a list of n+1 elements, all initialized to 0 except for the element at index `w[1]` which is now 1, `j` is 3, `q[w[j]]` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value at index `w[j]` in the list `q` by 1. Initially, `j` is 2, so `w[j]` is `w[2]`. After executing the code, `j` becomes 3 (since `j` is incremented implicitly by the operation), and the value at `q[w[2]]` is incremented by 1. Since `w[1]` was previously set to 1, and assuming no other changes to `w` or `q`, the only change is that `q[w[2]]` is now 1.
