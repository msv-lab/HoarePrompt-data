Output State: **`j` is 4, `eta_ln` must be greater than 3, `res` is `q[eta[3]] * (q[eta[3]] - 1) * (q[eta[3]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[3]] * (q[eta[3]] - 1) // 2 * rho + q[eta[4]] * (q[eta[4]] - 1) * (q[eta[4]] - 2) // 6`, `rho` is increased by `q[eta[3]] + q[eta[4]]`**.

Explanation: The value of `j` remains unchanged at 4. The value of `eta_ln` remains unchanged as it must be greater than 3. The value of `res` is updated by adding `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6`, which is `q[eta[4]] * (q[eta[4]] - 1) * (q[eta[4]] - 2) // 6`. Additionally, `rho` is increased by `q[eta[3]]` from the previous state and further increased by `q[eta[4]]` due to the code execution.
