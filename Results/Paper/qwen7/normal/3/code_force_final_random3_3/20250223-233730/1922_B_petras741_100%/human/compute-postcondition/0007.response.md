Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `j` is initialized to 0 within the loop itself (i.e., `i` is 0).
   - `n` is given as an integer greater than or equal to 3.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `j < n`. Since `j` starts at 0, the loop will execute as long as `j` remains less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `j` starts at 0, but it will increment within the loop. For the loop to execute at least once, `j` must be less than `n`.
   - `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute at all.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `j` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`j` is 0, `n` must be at least 3**
