You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of four non-negative integers p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200), representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence, respectively.
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum(3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for i, x in
    enumerate(map(int, input().split()))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))
    #This is printed: the integer part of the sum of the computed values for each test case divided by 3
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of four non-negative integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence. For each test case, it calculates the sum of specific formulas applied to these counts, divides the result by 3, and outputs the integer part of this division. The function then prints the calculated value for each test case on a new line.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve removes numbers optimally to maximize Bob's wins.

2. **Given Program:**
   ```python
   def func():
       print('\n'.join([str(sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))
   ```

3. **Breaking Down the Program:**
   - The function `func` reads an integer `t` which is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a line of input containing four integers: `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `p_4`.
   - It then processes these integers using a specific formula and prints the result.

4. **Formula Analysis:**
   - The formula inside the list comprehension is:
     ```python
     sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3
     ```
   - Here, `enumerate(map(int, input().split()))` converts the input into a list of integers and enumerates them.
   - For each integer `x` at index `i`, the expression `(3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3))` is evaluated:
     - `x // 2` gives the integer division of `x` by 2.
     - `x % 2` gives the remainder when `x` is divided by 2.
     - `i < 3` checks if the index `i` is less than 3.
     - The expression `3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3)` calculates a value based on the type of number (`1`, `2`, `3`, or `4`).

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The formula does not directly relate to the XOR operation or the conditions for Alice and Bob to win.
   - The formula seems to be calculating a different value based on the indices and values of the input integers.
   - Given the problem description, the formula should be related to the optimal removal strategy to maximize Bob's wins.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
   - The formula used in the program does not align with the conditions for determining the maximum number of Bob's wins.
