Output State: **`s` is a list of integers obtained from input, `r` is the sum of `2 * a[x] + 2` for each element `i` in `s`, `b[x]` is increased by the count of occurrences of `i` in `s`, `i` is the last element in the list `s`, and `t` is incremented by 1; `b` is a list of 26 zeros, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `s = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer, storing them in the list `s`. This operation does not affect the values of `r`, `b[x]`, `i`, `t`, `b`, or `n`. The value of `r` remains the sum of `2 * a[x] + 2` for each element `i` in the original `s`, `b[x]` remains increased by the count of occurrences of `i` in the original `s`, `i` remains the last element in the original `s`, and `t` remains incremented by 1. The list `b` and the variable `n` remain unchanged.
