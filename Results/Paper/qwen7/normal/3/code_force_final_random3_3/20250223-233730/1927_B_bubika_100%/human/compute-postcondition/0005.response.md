Output State: **`b` is a list of 26 zeros, `n` is an input integer, `s` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `r` is an empty string.**

The code `r = ''` initializes an empty string `r`. No other changes are made to the variables `b`, `n`, or `s`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
