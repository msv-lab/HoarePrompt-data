Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i < n; a is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
Code of the loop:
for t in range(int(input())):
    b = [0] * 26
    n = int(input())
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    r = ''
    for i in s:
        x = b.index(i)
        r += a[x]
        b[x] += 1
    print(r)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `r` is the concatenation of values from `a` based on the indices found in `s`, with each index in `b` incremented by the count of its occurrence in `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `r` is the sum of `2 * a[x] + 2` for each element `i` in `s`, `b[x]` is increased by the count of occurrences of `i` in `s`, and `i` is the last element in the list `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the loop executes all iterations, `r` will be a string formed by appending 'a[x]' for each iteration where `x` is the index of the current element `i` in the list `b`. The list `b` will have one of its elements incremented for each occurrence of each unique element in `s`. The variable `t` will be incremented by the total number of iterations, `i` will be the last element in the list `s` after all iterations, `n` will remain as the input integer, and `s` will be the list of integers obtained from input but modified during each iteration according to the loop's logic.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
