Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in s`. The only variable involved here is `i`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `b` is a list of 26 zeros except for the element at index `x` which is now 1.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `r` is 'a[x]' appended to the previous value.
   - `s` is a list of integers obtained from input with its elements cycled.
   - `t` is incremented by 1.
   - `x` is the index of `i` in `b`.
   - `r` is the previous value of `r` plus 'a[x]'.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are more elements in `s` to iterate over.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `s` using `i`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in `s`.
   - `n`, `r`, `s`, `t`, and `x` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is the next element in `s`.
- `n` remains the same.
- `r` remains the same.
- `s` remains the same.
- `t` remains the same.
- `x` remains the same.

Given that `i` is currently 0, the next element in `s` will be the first element of `s`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is the first element in `s`, `n` is an input integer, `r` is 'a[x]' appended to the previous value, `s` is a list of integers obtained from input with its elements cycled, `t` is incremented by 1, `x` is the index of `i` in `b`**
