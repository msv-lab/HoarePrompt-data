Output State: **`s` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, and `x` is the index of `i` in the list `b`.**

Explanation: The code `x = b.index(i)` finds the index of the element `i` in the list `b`. However, there is no mention of `b` in the initial state, only `s` is mentioned. Since `b` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its contents. Therefore, the only change is that `x` is assigned the index of `i` in the list `b`. The list `s` remains unchanged as per the initial state.
