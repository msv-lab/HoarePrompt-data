Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for t in range(int(input())):`. The objects involved here are `t` and the result of `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `t`**: According to the given information, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

3. **Determine the value of `int(input())`**: The value of `int(input())` is what determines how many times the loop will run. Since `t` is used as the variable in the loop, `int(input())` must provide a value within the same range as `t` (i.e., \(1 \leq \text{int(input())} \leq 10^4\)).

4. **Adjust the state**: For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must provide a valid value for `t`. Given that `t` is already constrained to be between 1 and \(10^4\), the input must also be within this range.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `int(input())` to ensure it is within the valid range for `t`.

**State:**
**`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and int(input()) must be a positive integer such that \(1 \leq \text{int(input())} \leq 10^4\)**
