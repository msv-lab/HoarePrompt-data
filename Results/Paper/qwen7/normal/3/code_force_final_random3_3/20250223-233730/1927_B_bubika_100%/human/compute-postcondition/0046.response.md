Output State: **`s` is a list of integers obtained from input, `r` is '', `b[x]` is increased by the count of occurrences of `i` in `s`, `i` is the last element in the list `s`, `t` is incremented by 1, `b` is a list of 26 zeros, `n` is an input integer, `x` is the index of `i` in `b`.**

Explanation: The code `x = b.index(i)` finds the index of the last element `i` in the list `b` and assigns it to `x`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
