Postcondition: `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user split by spaces. The first clue is not equal to 1, the third clue is less than or equal to the fifth clue, and either both the third and fifth clues are even numbers or both are odd numbers. Additionally, the third clue is not equal to the fifth clue, the third clue is now greater than the fifth clue, and the absolute difference between the third and fifth clues is greater than 1, and the condition `(clues[1] - clues[3] >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2) or clues[3] - clues[5] >= abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2))` is true.
