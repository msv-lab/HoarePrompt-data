Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing 'Alice', `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'Alice'` to the list `answers`. Initially, `i` is set to 1, so after the increment (which is not shown in the given code snippet but implied by the context), `i` becomes 2. The initial state of `test_cases` and `clues` remains unchanged.
