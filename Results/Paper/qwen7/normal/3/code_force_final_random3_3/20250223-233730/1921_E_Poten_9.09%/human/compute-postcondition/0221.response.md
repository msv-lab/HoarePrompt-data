Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 3, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Draw', 'Alice', `i` is 4, `clues` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `answers.append('Draw')` adds the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. Initially, `answers` contains either `'Bob'`, `'Draw'`, or `'Alice'`. After appending `'Draw'`, `answers` now contains `'Bob'`, `'Draw'`, and `'Alice'`, plus the newly added `'Draw'`, making it a list containing `'Bob'`, `'Draw'`, `'Alice'`, and `'Draw'`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1 (from 3 to 4) because the code is inside a loop or block where `i` is updated. The values of `test_cases` and `clues` remain unchanged.
