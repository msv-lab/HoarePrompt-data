Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list, `i` is 1, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user split by spaces, clues is updated to a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `clues = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and then assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `clues`. The other variables (`test_cases`, `answers`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
