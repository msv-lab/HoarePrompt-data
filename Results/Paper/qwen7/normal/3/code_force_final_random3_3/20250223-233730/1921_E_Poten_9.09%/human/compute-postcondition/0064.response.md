Postcondition: `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing either ['Draw'], ['Bob'], or ['Draw', 'Bob'], `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user split by spaces. The first clue is not equal to 1, the third clue is less than or equal to the fifth clue, and either both the third and fifth clues are even numbers or both are odd numbers. Additionally, the third clue is not equal to the fifth clue. If the absolute difference between the third and fifth clues is greater than 1, `answers` is set to either ['Draw'] or ['Bob']. Otherwise, `answers` is set to either 'Draw' or 'Bob' based on other specified conditions involving the differences between the second and fourth clues and the third and fifth clues.
