Output State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Draw', or 'Alice' for each test case, `i` is equal to `test_cases`, and `clues` is a list of integers for each test case as provided by the user.**

In this final output state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `test_cases` will still be a positive integer representing the total number of test cases. The list `answers` will contain the outcome ('Bob', 'Draw', or 'Alice') for each of the `test_cases` based on the conditions specified in the loop. The variable `i` will be equal to `test_cases` since it increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `test_cases`. The list `clues` will contain the list of integers provided as input for each test case, as it is defined and used within each iteration of the loop but does not change across iterations.
