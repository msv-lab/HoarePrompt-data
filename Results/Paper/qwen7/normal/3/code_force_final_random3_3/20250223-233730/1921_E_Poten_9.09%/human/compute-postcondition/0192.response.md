Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 3, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Draw', or 'Alice' with 'Draw' appended, `i` is 4, `clues` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. The initial state of `test_cases` being greater than 3 and `i` being 3 remain unchanged. After appending `'Draw'`, `i` is incremented by 1, making it 4. The state of `clues` remains the same as it was initially defined.
