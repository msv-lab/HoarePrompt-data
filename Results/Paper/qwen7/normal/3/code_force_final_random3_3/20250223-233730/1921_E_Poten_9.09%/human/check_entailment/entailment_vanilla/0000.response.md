### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Conditions and Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where Alice is in the last row (`x_a = h`). In this scenario, Alice cannot move further and the game ends in a draw.
   - Similarly, it correctly handles the case where Bob is in the first row (`x_b = 1`). Here, Bob cannot move further and the game also ends in a draw.

2. **Parity Check:**
   - The program checks the parity (even or odd) of the initial positions of Alice and Bob. This is a crucial part of determining the outcome because the movements are restricted to specific directions, which can affect whether a player can force a win.

3. **Position Comparison:**
   - The program compares the initial positions of Alice and Bob to determine who can force a win. Specifically, it checks if the absolute difference between their initial column positions is greater than 1, which can influence the outcome based on the parity check.

4. **Detailed Analysis of Each Case:**
   - For each test case, the program evaluates the positions and applies the rules to determine the winner or if the game is a draw.
   - The logic for determining the winner involves checking if the absolute difference between the initial column positions is more than 1, and if so, whether the player can force a win based on the parity of their starting positions.

5. **Output Validation:**
   - The program outputs the result for each test case, ensuring that the output matches the expected outcomes provided in the example.

### Conclusion:

After reviewing the code and the provided test cases, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the game outcome based on the given rules. The conditions and comparisons in the code align with the problem description and produce the correct results for the provided examples.

### Correctness:
