Postcondition: **`test_cases` must be greater than 3, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Draw', or 'Alice'. If `clues[2] > clues[4]` or `clues[0] == 1`, then 'Draw' is appended to `answers`, `i` becomes 4, and `clues` remains a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces. Otherwise, `i` remains 3, and `answers` may append 'Draw' if certain conditions involving `clues[2]`, `clues[3]`, `clues[4]`, and `clues[5]` are met.**
