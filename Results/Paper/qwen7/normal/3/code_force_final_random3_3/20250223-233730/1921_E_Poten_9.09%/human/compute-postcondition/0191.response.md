Postcondition: **`test_cases` must be greater than 3, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Draw', or 'Alice'. If `clues[3] - 1` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, or if `clues[5] - clues[3]` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, then `i` is set to 4. Otherwise, `i` remains 3.**
