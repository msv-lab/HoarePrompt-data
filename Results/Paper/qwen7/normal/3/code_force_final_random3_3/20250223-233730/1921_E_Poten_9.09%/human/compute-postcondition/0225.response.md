Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 3, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Draw', and 'Alice', `i` is 4, `clues` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `answers.append('Alice')` adds the string `'Alice'` to the list `answers`. Initially, `answers` contains `'Bob'` and `'Draw'`. After appending `'Alice'`, `answers` now contains `'Bob'`, `'Draw'`, and `'Alice'`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 (since `i` was initially 3, it becomes 4). The other variables (`test_cases` and `clues`) remain unchanged.
