Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 3, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Draw', or 'Alice' with 'Draw' appended, `i` is 4, `clues` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. The initial state of `answers` contains either `'Bob'`, `'Draw'`, or `'Alice'`, and after appending `'Draw'`, it now contains these three elements plus the newly added `'Draw'`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 (from 3 to 4) because the code snippet does not specify the exact increment but follows the pattern of incrementing by 1 when no specific increment is given. The other variables (`test_cases` and `clues`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
