Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 3, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Draw', or 'Alice', `i` is 4, `clues` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `answers.append('Bob')` adds the string `'Bob'` to the list `answers`. The length of `answers` increases by one. The initial value of `i` was 3, and after executing the line `i += 1`, `i` becomes 4. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `i` being incremented to 4, while the conditions and values of other variables are kept as per the initial state.
