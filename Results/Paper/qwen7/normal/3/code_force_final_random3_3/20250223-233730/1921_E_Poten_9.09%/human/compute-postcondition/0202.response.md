Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 3, `answers` is a list containing 'Alice', 'Draw', 'Bob', `i` is 4, `clues` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `answers.append('Bob')` adds the string `'Bob'` to the list `answers`. Initially, `answers` contains either `'Alice'`, `'Draw'`, or both. After appending `'Bob'`, `answers` now contains `'Alice'`, `'Draw'`, and `'Bob'`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 (from 3 to 4) due to the implicit increment in the next line of code (not shown here), and the state of `test_cases` and `clues` remains unchanged.
