Postcondition: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw' or 'Bob', `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces.**

This postcondition remains the same for both the if and else parts, indicating that regardless of whether the condition `clues[3] < clues[5]` is true or false, the final state of the variables `test_cases`, `answers`, `i`, and `clues` will be as described.
