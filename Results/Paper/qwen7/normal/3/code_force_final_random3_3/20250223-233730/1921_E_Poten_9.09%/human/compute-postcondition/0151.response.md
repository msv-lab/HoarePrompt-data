Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces**.

Explanation: The code appends the string `'Bob'` to the list `answers`. Initially, `i` was set to 1. After appending `'Bob'` to `answers`, `i` is incremented by 1 (though the increment is not shown in the given code snippet, it is implied by the initial value of `i`). The initial conditions for `test_cases` and `clues` remain unchanged.
