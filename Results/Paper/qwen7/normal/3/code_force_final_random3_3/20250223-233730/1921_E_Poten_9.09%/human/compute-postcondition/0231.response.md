Postcondition: `test_cases` must be greater than 3, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Draw', and 'Alice'. `i` is set to 4 if the condition `clues[3] < clues[5]` is true and either of the following conditions is met:
- `clues[1] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`
- `clues[5] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`

Otherwise, `i` is set to 3 if the condition `clues[3] < clues[5]` is false and `abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) <= 1`, or `i` is set to 4 if `abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) > 1`. In both cases, 'Draw' is appended to `answers` if the respective conditions are true, otherwise `answers` remains unchanged.
