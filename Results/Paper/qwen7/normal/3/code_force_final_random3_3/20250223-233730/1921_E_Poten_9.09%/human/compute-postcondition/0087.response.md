Postcondition: `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw' or 'Alice', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user split by spaces, `clues[2]` is not even, `clues[4]` is not even, `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]`, and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, and the outcome depends on whether the condition `clues[1] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[5] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` is met. If the condition is true, `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Alice'.
