Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is ['Alice'], `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user split by spaces, `clues[2]` is not even, or `clues[4]` is not even, and the value of `clues[3]` is equal to the value of `clues[5]`**

Explanation: The code appends 'Alice' to the `answers` list. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
