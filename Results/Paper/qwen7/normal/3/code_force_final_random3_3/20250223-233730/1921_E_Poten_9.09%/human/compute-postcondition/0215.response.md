Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 3, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', 'Draw', or 'Alice' with 'Draw' appended, `i` is 4, `clues` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. Initially, `answers` contains either 'Bob', 'Draw', or 'Alice'. After appending `'Draw'`, `answers` will contain these elements plus the newly added `'Draw'`. Additionally, the variable `i` is incremented by 1 since it was initially set to 3, making it 4 now. The conditions and values of other variables remain unchanged.
