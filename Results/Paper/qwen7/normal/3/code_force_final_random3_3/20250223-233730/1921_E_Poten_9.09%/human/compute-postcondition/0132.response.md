Postcondition: `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list, `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers entered by the user split by spaces. If `clues[2]` is greater than `clues[4]` or `clues[0]` equals 1, `answers` will contain 'Draw'. Otherwise, depending on the conditions, `answers` will contain one of the following: 'Bob', 'Draw', ['Draw', 'Bob'], 'Draw', or 'Alice'. Specifically, if `clues[3]` equals `clues[5]`, `answers` will contain 'Bob' or ['Bob']. If `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, `answers` will contain 'Draw' or 'Alice' based on the comparisons involving the differences between the clues.
