Postcondition: `test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing either 'Bob', 'Draw', or 'Alice', `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces.

This means that after the if-else block executes, `test_cases` remains greater than 0, `answers` will contain one of the strings 'Bob', 'Draw', or 'Alice', `i` is set to 2, and `clues` is a list of integers converted from the user's input split by spaces.
