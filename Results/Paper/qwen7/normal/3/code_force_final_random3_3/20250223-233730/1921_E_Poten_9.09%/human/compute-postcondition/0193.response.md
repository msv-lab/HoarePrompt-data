Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 3, `answers` is a list containing 'Alice', 'Draw', and 'Bob', `i` is 4, `clues` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code appends the string `'Bob'` to the list `answers`. Initially, `answers` contains either `'Alice'`, `'Draw'`, or both. After appending `'Bob'`, `answers` now contains `'Alice'`, `'Draw'`, and `'Bob'`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 (from 3 to 4) because the length of `answers` has increased by 1. The precondition that `test_cases` must be greater than 3 remains unchanged, and the value of `clues` remains the same as it was before the code execution.
