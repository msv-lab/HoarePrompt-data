Postcondition: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw' or 'Alice', `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces.** 

This means that regardless of whether the condition `abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) > 1` is true or false, the final state of the variables will be as described: `test_cases` remains greater than 0, `answers` remains a list containing either 'Draw' or 'Alice', `i` is set to 2, and `clues` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces.
