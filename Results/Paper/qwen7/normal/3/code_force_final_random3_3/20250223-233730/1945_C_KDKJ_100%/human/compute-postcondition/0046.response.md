Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0; `left` is `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `i`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`; `rsum` is `n - i`.**

Explanation: The code updates `rsum` to `n - i`. The values of `n`, `left`, `lsum`, `right`, and the initial calculation of `right` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value of `rsum` which is now `n - i`.
