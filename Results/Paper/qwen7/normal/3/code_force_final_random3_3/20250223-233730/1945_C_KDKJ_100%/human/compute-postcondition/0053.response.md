Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `left` is `S[i][0]`, `lsum` is `i + 1`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i+1][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (i + 1)`, `ans` is unchanged or updated based on the condition.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `left` to `S[i][0]`. The other variables (`n`, `lsum`, `right`, `rsum`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial or previous states.
