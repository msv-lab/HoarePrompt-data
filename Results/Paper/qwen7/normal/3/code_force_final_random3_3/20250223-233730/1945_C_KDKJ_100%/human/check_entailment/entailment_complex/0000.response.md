Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function correctly processes the input string `a` to count the number of '0's (left side preference) and '1's (right side preference) up to each position.
   - It then iterates through each possible position `i` to check if placing the road there satisfies the condition that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.
   - The function correctly updates the variable `ans` to store the position `i` that minimizes the absolute difference \( \left| \frac{n}{2} - i \right| \) while satisfying the condition.
   - The function handles edge cases and ensures that the output is the smallest valid position `i`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then calls `func_1()` for each test case.
   - The function correctly processes each test case by calling `func_1()` the appropriate number of times as specified by the input.
   - The function does not modify any global state outside of the loop, ensuring that each test case is processed independently.

3. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal position `i` for placing the road for each test case.
   - The program handles multiple test cases and processes them independently.
   - The program outputs the correct result for each test case as per the problem statement.

Given the analysis above, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
