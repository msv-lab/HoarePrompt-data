Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0; `left` is `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `i + 1`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i+1][1]`; `rsum` is `n - (i + 1)`**

Explanation: The code changes the value of `left` to `S[i][0]`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `left` is now `S[i][0]`, while `n`, `lsum`, `right`, and `rsum` retain their original values as per the initial state.
