Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly implements the logic to find the optimal position `i` such that the number of residents preferring to live on the left side up to position `i` is at least half of those up to `i`, and the number of residents preferring to live on the right side from position `i` to the end is also at least half of those from `i` to the end. It uses a prefix sum approach to keep track of the counts of '0's and '1's up to each position and then checks for the conditions specified in the problem statement.
2. **Function `func_2`**: This function reads the number of test cases and then calls `func_1` for each test case. However, the execution summary states that `func_2` calls `func_1` exactly three times, which contradicts the problem statement that it should read the number of test cases and call `func_1` for each test case. This discrepancy suggests that `func_2` is not correctly implemented according to the problem description.

Given these observations, while `func_1` appears to be correct, `func_2` is not correctly implemented and does not match the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
