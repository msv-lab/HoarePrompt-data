Output State: **`func_1()` has already been called.**

Explanation: The given code snippet `func_1()` simply calls the function `func_1()`. Since `func_1()` has already been called according to the initial state, calling it again does not change its state. The variables `n` and `a` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head or affected by the function call. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, which is `func_1()` has already been called.
