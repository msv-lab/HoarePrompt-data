You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and a is a string of length n consisting only of '0' and '1'.
def func_2():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()
        
    #State: Output State: `func_1()` has already been called three times.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs for a number of iterations specified by the user input. Based on the provided output states, each iteration of the loop calls `func_1()`. After the loop executes 3 times, `func_1()` has been called twice. Therefore, if the loop were to run to completion, `func_1()` would be called as many times as the loop iterates. Since no further information about the changes inside `func_1()` or any other variables outside the loop is given, we can conclude that `func_1()` will be called one more time if the loop completes all its iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns a string of length n, where n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, consisting only of '0' and '1'.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
