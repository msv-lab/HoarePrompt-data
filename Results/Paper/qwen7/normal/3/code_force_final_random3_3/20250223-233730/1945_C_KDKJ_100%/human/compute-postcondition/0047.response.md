The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since there is no loop context provided, the values of the variables `n`, `left`, `lsum`, `right`, and `rsum` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0; `left` is `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `i`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`; `rsum` is `n - i`.**
