Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of houses, and `a`, a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. It calculates and prints the optimal position `i` such that the number of residents preferring to live on the left side up to position `i` is at least half of those up to `i`, and the number of residents preferring to live on the right side from position `i` to the end is also at least half of those from `i` to the end. If no such position exists, it prints -1.**
