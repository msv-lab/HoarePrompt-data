### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires constructing a sequence of \( n \) non-negative integers such that their sum equals \( k \), and the number of `1`s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR is maximized.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case individually. This part is handled well by the outer loop.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes \( n \) and \( k \) as parameters.
   - It initializes a list `nums` with \( n \) zeros.
   - It sets each element of `nums` to \((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1\). This value is the largest number with \( k.bit_length() \) bits (i.e., \( 2^{k.bit_length()} - 1 \)).
   - It subtracts this value from \( k \) for each iteration.
   - Finally, it adjusts the last element to ensure the sum of the list equals \( k \).

4. **Binary Representation and Bitwise OR**:
   - The value \((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1\) is a number with \( k.bit_length() \) bits all set to `1`.
   - Using this value ensures that each element contributes the maximum possible number of `1`s in the binary representation.
   - However, this approach may not always maximize the number of `1`s in the bitwise OR of the entire sequence because it doesn't consider the bitwise OR across all elements.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - For small values of \( k \), the approach might work as expected.
   - For larger values of \( k \), the approach might not be optimal. For example, if \( k \) is a power of 2, setting all elements to \( k-1 \) might not maximize the bitwise OR. Instead, a more strategic distribution of values could yield better results.

6. **Optimality**:
   - The provided solution does not guarantee the optimal solution for all cases. For instance, consider \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 4 \). The optimal solution would be \([4, 0]\) because \( 4 | 0 = 4 \) (binary: `100`), which has 2 `1`s. However, the provided solution would give \([3, 1]\) because \( 3 | 1 = 3 \) (binary: `11`), which also has 2 `1`s but does not use the full potential of the bitwise OR operation.

7. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program correctly formats the output by joining the elements of `nums` with spaces and joining the results of all test cases with newlines.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not guarantee the optimal solution for all cases. While it attempts to maximize the number of `1`s in the bitwise OR by setting most elements to the largest possible value with \( k.bit_length() \) bits, it does not always achieve the maximum possible number of `1`s in the bitwise OR of the entire sequence. Therefore, the program is not fully correct according to the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
