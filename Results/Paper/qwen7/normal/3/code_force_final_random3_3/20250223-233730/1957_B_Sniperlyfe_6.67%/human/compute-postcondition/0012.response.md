Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`; `k` is equal to 0; `n` is a positive integer; `nums` is a list where every element from index 0 to `n-2` is set to `(1 << (0).bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and the last element `nums[-1]` is set to the sum of the original value of `k` and 0.**

Explanation: 
- Initially, `nums` is a list where each element from index 0 to `n-1` is set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. Since `k` is 0, each element in `nums` is `(1 << 0) - 1`, which is `0`.
- After the loop completes, `k` is reduced to 0.
- The line `nums[-1] += k` adds the current value of `k` (which is 0) to the last element of `nums`. Since `k` is 0, the last element remains unchanged.
- Therefore, the last element `nums[-1]` is still 0.
