Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for i in range(n)` statement. Therefore, the variables involved are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is currently 2.
   - `k` is a computed value based on the expression `k - ((k - (1 << (k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)) - (1 << (k.bit_length() - 1) - 1) - 1)`.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `nums` is a list with its first element set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and its second element set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop condition is based on `i < n`, `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, `i` will become 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

4. **Construct the new state**:
   - `i` becomes 3.
   - `k` remains unchanged as it is not directly modified by the loop.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `nums` remains unchanged as it is not directly modified by the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 3, `k` is `k - ((k - (1 << (k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)) - (1 << (k.bit_length() - 1) - 1) - 1)`, `n` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list with its first element set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` and its second element set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`**
