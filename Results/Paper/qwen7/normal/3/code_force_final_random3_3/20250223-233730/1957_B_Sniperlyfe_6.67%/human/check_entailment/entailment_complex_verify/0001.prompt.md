You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        k -= nums[i]
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and k are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        
        k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is equal to `n`; `k` is equal to 0; `n` is a positive integer; `nums` is a list where every element from index 0 to `n-1` is set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and `k` has been reduced to 0 after subtracting the necessary values for each iteration of the loop.
    #
    #This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the original value of `n`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times. The variable `k` will be 0 because it has been fully decremented by the operations within the loop. The list `nums` will contain `n` elements, each set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which simplifies to the highest power of 2 less than `k` when `k` was originally set, ensuring that `k` is reduced to 0 through these operations.
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list `nums` where the first `n-1` elements are all set to `0`, and the last element is `0`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. It initializes a list `nums` of size `n` with all elements set to the highest power of 2 less than `k`. After setting the initial values, it ensures the last element of `nums` is adjusted to make `k` equal to 0. Finally, it returns a list `nums` where the first `n-1` elements are `0`, and the last element is `0`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires constructing a sequence of `n` non-negative integers such that their sum equals `k`, and the number of `1`s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR is maximized.

2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is handled well by the outer loop.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes `n` and `k` as parameters.
   - It initializes a list `nums` with `n` zeros.
   - It sets each element of `nums` to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. This value is the largest number with `k.bit_length()` bits (i.e., `2^(k.bit_length()) - 1`).
   - It subtracts this value from `k` for each iteration.
   - Finally, it adjusts the last element to ensure the sum of the list equals `k`.

4. **Binary Representation and Bitwise OR**:
   - The value `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` is a number with `k.bit_length()` bits all set to `1`.
   - Using this value ensures that each element contributes the maximum possible number of `1`s in the binary representation.
   - However, this approach may not always maximize the number of `1`s in the bitwise OR of the entire sequence because it doesn't consider the bitwise OR across all elements.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - For small values of `k`, the approach might work as expected.
   - For larger values of `k`, the approach might not be optimal. For example, if `k` is a power of 2, setting all elements to `k-1` might not maximize the bitwise OR.

6. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program correctly formats the output by joining the elements of `nums` with spaces and joining the results of all test cases with newlines.

### Conclusion:
While the provided solution attempts to maximize the number of `1`s in the bitwise OR by setting most elements to the largest possible value with `k.bit_length()` bits, it does not guarantee the optimal solution for all cases. Therefore, the program is not fully correct according to the problem statement.
