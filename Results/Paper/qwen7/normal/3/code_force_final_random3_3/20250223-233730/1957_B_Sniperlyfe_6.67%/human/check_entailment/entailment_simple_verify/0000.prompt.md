You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        k -= nums[i]
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and k are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        
        k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is equal to `n`; `k` is equal to 0; `n` is a positive integer; `nums` is a list where every element from index 0 to `n-1` is set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and `k` has been reduced to 0 after subtracting the necessary values for each iteration of the loop.
    #
    #This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the original value of `n`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times. The variable `k` will be 0 because it has been fully decremented by the operations within the loop. The list `nums` will contain `n` elements, each set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which simplifies to the highest power of 2 less than `k` when `k` was originally set, ensuring that `k` is reduced to 0 through these operations.
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list `nums` where the first `n-1` elements are all set to `0`, and the last element is `0`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle cases where the value of `k` is less than `n`. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` assumes that each element in the resulting list can be set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is the largest possible value with the number of bits equal to `k.bit_length()`. However, this approach does not guarantee that the sum of the elements will be exactly `k`.

For example, consider the input `n = 3` and `k = 1`. According to the problem description, the output should be a sequence of three non-negative integers that sum to 1 and maximize the number of 1s in their bitwise OR. A valid solution would be `[1, 0, 0]` or `[0, 1, 0]` or `[0, 0, 1]`, but the current implementation will generate `[1, 1, 1]`, which sums to 3, not 1.

To fix this, the program needs to adjust the values dynamically based on the remaining value of `k` after setting as many elements as possible to the maximum value. Here is a corrected version:

```python
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
    return nums
```

This corrected version ensures that the sum of the elements equals `k` and attempts to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence.
