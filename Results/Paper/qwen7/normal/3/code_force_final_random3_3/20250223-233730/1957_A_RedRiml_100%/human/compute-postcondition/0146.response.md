Output State: **`shapes` is increased by `d[j] // 3` + the previous value of `shapes`.**

Explanation: The code `shapes += d[j] // 3` increments the value of `shapes` by `d[j] // 3`. Since `d[j]` is specified to be greater than or equal to 3, `d[j] // 3` is a specific integer value. The initial state also mentions that `shapes` is increased by `d[j] // 3`, which means the new value of `shapes` is the previous value of `shapes` plus `d[j] // 3`. The other conditions and preconditions remain unchanged.
