Output State: **`palka` is a list of integers with at least one element, `i` is the first element in the list `palka`, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is either `1` (if `i` was already in `d`) or `1` incremented by `1` (if `i` was not in `d`), and `i` is now in `pl`.**

Explanation: The code `pl.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the list `pl`. Since `i` was initially the first element in the list `palka`, and no other changes were made to `palka` or `i`, `palka` remains unchanged. The dictionary `d` also remains unchanged because appending `i` to `pl` does not affect the dictionary's contents. Therefore, `i` is now added to `pl`.
