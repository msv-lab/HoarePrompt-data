Based on the initial state provided:

- `shapes` is increased by the sum of `d[j] // 3` for every `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.

This means that `shapes` has been modified by adding up the integer division of `d[j]` by 3 for all indices `j` in the list `pl` where `d[j]` is 3 or more.

However, since the actual values of `shapes`, `d`, and `pl` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `shapes` after the modification.

Therefore, the output will be the updated value of `shapes` after performing the described operation.

Output: **shapes (where shapes is the value obtained by increasing the original value of shapes by the sum of d[j] // 3 for every j in pl where d[j] >= 3)**
