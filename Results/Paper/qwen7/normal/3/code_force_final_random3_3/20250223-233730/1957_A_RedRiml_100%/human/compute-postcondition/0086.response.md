Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the list `pl`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `shapes` is 0 (this is not relevant to the loop execution).
   - `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the list `palka` and its value is the count of occurrences of that element in `palka`.
   - `pl` is a list that contains all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in `pl`. For the loop to execute, `pl` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `pl` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `pl` is not empty.
   - The initial state of `pl` is determined by the list `palka` and how the unique elements are extracted and ordered.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the list `pl` to ensure it contains at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`shapes` is 0, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the list `palka` and its value is the count of occurrences of that element in `palka`, `pl` is a list that must contain at least one unique element from `palka` in the order they first appeared**.
