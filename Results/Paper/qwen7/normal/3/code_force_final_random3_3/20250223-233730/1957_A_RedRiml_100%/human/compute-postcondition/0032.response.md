Output State: **Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` is an input integer, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a non-empty list of integers, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements of `palka`, and `d` is a dictionary where each key `i` from `palka` is associated with the count of how many times `i` appears in `palka`.**

In this final state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t`, `w`, and `ln` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop. The list `palka` remains as it was initially provided. The list `pl` will contain all the unique elements from `palka`, meaning any duplicate elements in `palka` will appear only once in `pl`. The dictionary `d` will have each unique element from `palka` as a key, with the corresponding value being the count of how many times that element appeared in `palka`.
