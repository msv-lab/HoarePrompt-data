Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in palka:`. The variables involved here are `i` and `palka`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i`: This variable will take on each value from the list `palka` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `palka`: This is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `palka` must contain at least one element. If `palka` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - We need to ensure that `palka` is not empty. Since `palka` is a list of integers, it must have at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The value of `i` will change during each iteration, but we don't need to specify its exact value initially because the loop will handle that.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `palka` must be a non-empty list of integers.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` is an input integer, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a non-empty list of integers, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary**
