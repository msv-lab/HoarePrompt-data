Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `shapes` is 0, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the list `palka` and its value is the count of occurrences of that element in `palka`, the list `pl` will contain all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared.
Code of the loop:
for j in pl:
    if d[j] >= 3:
        shapes += d[j] // 3


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `shapes` is `d[j] // 3`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the list `palka` and its value is the count of occurrences of that element in `palka`, `pl` is a list that must contain at least one unique element from `palka` in the order they first appeared.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `shapes` is `2 * (d[j] // 3)`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the list `palka` and its value is the count of occurrences of that element in `palka`, `pl` is a list that must contain at least two unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `shapes` is adjusted to either `3 * (d[j] // 3)` if `d[j] >= 3`, or remains as `2 * (d[j] // 3)`. `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the list `palka` and its value is the count of occurrences of that element in `palka`, `pl` is a list that must contain at least two unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared, and `j` is the next element in `pl`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
