Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` is an input integer, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a non-empty list of integers, `pl` is a list with at least one more element (since it was initially empty and now includes `i`), `d` is a dictionary where for each key `i` not in `pl`, `d[i]` is incremented by 1, and for keys already in `pl`, `d[i]` remains 1.**

The code `pl.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the list `pl`. Since `pl` was initially empty, after appending `i`, `pl` now contains at least one element (`i`). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
