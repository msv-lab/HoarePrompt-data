Output State: **`d` is a dictionary, `i` is a key in `d`, and the value of `d[i]` is now `d[i] + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `d[i] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `i` in the dictionary `d` by 1. Since the initial value of `d[i]` was not `None`, it is now `d[i] + 1`. The other conditions remain unchanged.
