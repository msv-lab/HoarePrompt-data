Output State: **`d` is a dictionary, `d[i]` is 1, `i` is an index in the dictionary.**

Explanation: The code `d[i] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. The initial state tells us that `d.get(i)` was `None`, which means that `i` was not a key in the dictionary before this assignment. After the assignment, `d[i]` is now `1`. The variable `i` remains an index in the dictionary.
