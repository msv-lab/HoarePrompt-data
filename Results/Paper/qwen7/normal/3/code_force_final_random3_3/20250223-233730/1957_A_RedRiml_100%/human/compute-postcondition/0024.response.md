Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` is an input integer, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a non-empty list of integers with `i` being the second element, `pl` is a list containing at least one element `i` with `i` appended, `d` is a dictionary where for each key `i` not in `pl` before the if statement, `d[i]` is incremented by 1, and for keys already in `pl`, `d[i]` remains 1.** 

This means that regardless of whether the condition `i not in pl` is true or false (since there is no else part provided), the final state of the variables `t`, `w`, `ln`, `palka`, `pl`, and `d` will be as described above. Specifically, `d[i]` will be incremented by 1 for keys not in `pl` and will remain 1 for keys already in `pl`.
