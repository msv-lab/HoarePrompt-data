Output State: **`shapes` is 0, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the list `palka` and its value is the count of occurrences of that element in `palka`, the list `pl` will contain all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared.**

Explanation: The code `shapes = 0` initializes the variable `shapes` to 0. It does not affect the dictionary `d` or the list `pl`. Therefore, the dictionary `d` retains its original state, where each key is an element from the list `palka` and its value is the count of occurrences of that element in `palka`. Similarly, the list `pl` remains unchanged, containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared.
