Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `ans` is the total number of times `a[i] - a[i - 1]` equals 2 or is even, `tmp` contains elements which are half the difference between consecutive elements of `a` when that difference is even, `tmp.sort()` is called, and if `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` equals 2, `ans` is incremented by 1. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is even, `tmp` includes an additional element `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`.
Code of the loop:
for i in tmp:
    if y >= i - 1:
        ans += i
        y -= i - 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `tmp` must not be empty, `y` is decreased by `i-1`, and `ans` is increased by `i` if `y` is greater than or equal to `i-1`. If `y` is less than `i-1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `tmp` must not be empty, `i` is either removed from `tmp` and `ans` is updated by adding the first element from `tmp` before removal and decreasing `y` by `i - 1`, or `i` remains as the first element from `tmp` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `tmp` now has one fewer element, `i` is either the first element of the original `tmp` or has been removed, `ans` is the sum of its previous value and `i`, `y` is decreased by `i - 1` if `y >= i - 1`. Otherwise, `i` is either the first element of the new `tmp` or has been removed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
