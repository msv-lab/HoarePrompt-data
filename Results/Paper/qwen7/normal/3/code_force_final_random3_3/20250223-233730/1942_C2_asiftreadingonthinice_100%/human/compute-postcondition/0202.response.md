Output State: **`ans` is the sum of its initial value plus the sum of all elements in `tmp`, and `y` is reduced by the sum of all elements in `tmp`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += y` adds the current value of `y` to `ans`. Since `y` is reduced by the sum of all elements in `tmp` during each iteration (as per the initial state), `y` is already updated. Therefore, `ans` now includes the sum of all elements in `tmp` added to its initial value. The state of `y` is also updated to reflect the reduction by the sum of all elements in `tmp`.
