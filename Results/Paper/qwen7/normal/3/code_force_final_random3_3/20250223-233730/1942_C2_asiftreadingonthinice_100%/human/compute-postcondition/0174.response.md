Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(a)`, `ans` is the total number of times `a[i] - a[i - 1]` equals 2 or is even, `tmp` contains elements which are half the difference between consecutive elements of `a` when that difference is even, and `tmp` now includes an additional element `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2` to the list `tmp`. Since `i` is already equal to `len(a)`, `ans` remains unchanged, and `tmp` now includes the new element.
