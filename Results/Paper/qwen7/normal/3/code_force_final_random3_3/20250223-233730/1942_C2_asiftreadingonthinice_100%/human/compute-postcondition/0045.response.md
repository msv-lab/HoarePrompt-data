Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in tmp:`. Therefore, the only objects involved are `i` and `tmp`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `tmp`**:
   - `i` is iterating over the elements in `tmp`.
   - `tmp` contains all the values added to `tmp` whenever `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even and equals to 2 modulo 2.

3. **Understand the loop body**: Since the loop body is omitted, we cannot infer any specific actions inside the loop. However, the loop will continue as long as there are elements in `tmp`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `tmp` is not empty. Therefore, we need to ensure that `tmp` is non-empty.
   - The value of `i` will change with each iteration, but its initial value is not specified. We only need to ensure that `tmp` is non-empty for the loop to start.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `tmp` must be a non-empty list.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is the sum of all increments made to it during the loop, `tmp` must be a non-empty list containing all the values added to it whenever `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even and equals to 2 modulo 2.**
