Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is the sum of all increments made to it during the loop, and `tmp` contains all the values added to it whenever `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even and equals to 2 modulo 2. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is equal to 2, then `ans` is incremented by 1. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is even, then `tmp` will have an additional element which is `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`. The list `tmp` is sorted.**

Explanation: The code `tmp.sort()` sorts the list `tmp` in ascending order. However, sorting does not affect the values of `i`, `ans`, or the condition checks involving `a[0]`, `n`, and `a[len(a) - 1]`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged. The only change is that `tmp` is now sorted.
