Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `len(a)`, `ans` will be the total number of times `a[i] - a[i - 1]` equals 2 or is even, and `tmp` will contain elements which are half the difference between consecutive elements of `a` when that difference is even.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations:
- The variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `a`.
- The variable `ans` will hold the count of how many times the difference between two consecutive elements in `a` is either 2 or an even number.
- The list `tmp` will contain the results of dividing the even differences between consecutive elements by 2. If there were no even differences, `tmp` will remain empty.
