Output State: **`i` is 2; `a` is a list of integers; `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code appends to `tmp` a tuple which is the result of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`. Given that `i` is 2, the expression becomes `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`. Since `a` is a list of integers, `a[1]` and `a[2]` are integers, and the result of the subtraction and division is also an integer. The variable `tmp` is assumed to be a list that gets updated with this new value.
