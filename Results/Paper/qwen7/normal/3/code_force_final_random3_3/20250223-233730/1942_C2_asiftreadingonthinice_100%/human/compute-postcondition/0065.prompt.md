Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is the sum of all increments made to it during the loop, and `tmp` contains all the values added to it whenever `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even and equals to 2 modulo 2. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is equal to 2, then `ans` is incremented by 1. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is even, then `tmp` will have an additional element which is `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`. The list `tmp` is sorted.
Code of the loop:
for i in tmp:
    if y >= i - 1:
        ans += i
        y -= i - 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is the sum of all increments made to it during the loop, and `tmp` is a non-empty list containing all the values added to it whenever `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even and equals to 2 modulo 2. Additionally, `y` is either 1 if `i` is equal to `len(a) - 1` and `y` is equal to `i - (i - 1)`, or `y` is less than `i - 1` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `ans` is increased by `i` if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `ans` is increased by `i` if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`. If the condition `y >= i - 1` is met, `y` is updated to `y - (i - 1)`. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `i` becomes the next element in `tmp`, and `tmp` is the list without the current element `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
