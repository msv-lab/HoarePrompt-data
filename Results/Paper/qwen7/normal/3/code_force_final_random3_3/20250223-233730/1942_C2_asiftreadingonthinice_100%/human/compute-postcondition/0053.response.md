Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in tmp:`. The only variable involved here is `i`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `tmp`. Since `tmp` is a non-empty list, the loop will execute for each element in `tmp`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is the current element from the list `tmp`.
   - `ans` is the sum of all increments made to it during the loop.
   - `tmp` is a non-empty list containing all the values added to it whenever `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even and equals to 2 modulo 2.
   - `y` is either 1 if `i` is equal to `len(a) - 1` and `y` is equal to `i - (i - 1)`, or `y` is less than `i - 1` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is taken from `tmp`, the value of `i` will change to the next element in `tmp` for the next iteration.
   - The value of `ans` remains unchanged because the increment operation happens inside the loop body, not outside.
   - The list `tmp` remains the same unless the loop body modifies it, but since no modification is mentioned, it stays the same.
   - The value of `y` remains unchanged because it is determined based on the condition at the end of the loop, not during the loop itself.

Given the above points, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` takes the next value from `tmp`.

**State:**
- `i` is the next element from the list `tmp`.
- `ans` is the same as before.
- `tmp` is the same as before.
- `y` is the same as before.

Since `tmp` is a non-empty list, let's assume the next value of `i` is the first element of `tmp` (if we are considering the first iteration of the new loop).

**State:**
**`i` is the first element from the list `tmp`, `ans` is the sum of all increments made to it during the loop, `tmp` is a non-empty list containing all the values added to it whenever `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even and equals to 2 modulo 2, and `y` is the same as before.**

However, without knowing the exact initial value of `tmp`, we can generalize it as follows:

**State:**
**`i` is the next element from the list `tmp`, `ans` is the sum of all increments made to it during the loop, `tmp` is a non-empty list containing all the values added to it whenever `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even and equals to 2 modulo 2, and `y` is the same as before.**
