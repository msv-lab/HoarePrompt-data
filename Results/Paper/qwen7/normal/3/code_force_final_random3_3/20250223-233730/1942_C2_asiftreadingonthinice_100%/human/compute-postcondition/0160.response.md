Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, len(a)):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `len(a)`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `len(a)` must be at least 1.
   - `ans` is 2 (this variable is not part of the loop head and does not need to be adjusted).
   - `tmp` contains an element which is `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2` (this variable is not part of the loop head and does not need to be adjusted).

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(a)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 3, and `len(a)` must still be at least 1.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - `len(a)` must remain at least 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `len(a)` must be at least 1**.
