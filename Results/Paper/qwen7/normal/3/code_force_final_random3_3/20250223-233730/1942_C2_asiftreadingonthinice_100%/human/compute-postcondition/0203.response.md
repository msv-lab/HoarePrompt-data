To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `ans` is the sum of its initial value plus the sum of all elements in `tmp`.
   - `y` is reduced by the sum of all elements in `tmp`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement `print(min(ans, n - 2))` will print the minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2`.

Given the initial state, we need to express the value of `ans`:
- Let's denote the initial value of `ans` as `initial_ans`.
- Let the sum of all elements in `tmp` be `sum_tmp`.

Therefore, `ans = initial_ans + sum_tmp`.

Now, we need to compare `ans` with `n - 2` to find the minimum value.

Since the exact values of `initial_ans`, `sum_tmp`, and `n` are not provided, we can only describe the expression that will be evaluated.

Output: **min(initial_ans + sum_tmp, n - 2)**
