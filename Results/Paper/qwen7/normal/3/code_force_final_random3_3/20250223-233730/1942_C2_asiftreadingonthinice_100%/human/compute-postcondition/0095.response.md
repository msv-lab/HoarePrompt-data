Output State: **`i` is 3; `a` is a list of integers; `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`**

Explanation: The code appends to `tmp` the value of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`. Given that `i` is 3, this translates to `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`. Since `a` is a list of integers, `a[3]` and `a[2]` are specific integers from the list. The value of `tmp` is updated with this calculation, while `i` and `a` retain their original values.
