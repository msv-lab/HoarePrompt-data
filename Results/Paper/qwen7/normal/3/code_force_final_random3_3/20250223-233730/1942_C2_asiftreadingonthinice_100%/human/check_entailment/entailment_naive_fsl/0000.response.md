Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the chosen vertices are consecutive. For example, consider the following input:

```
4 2 2
1 3
```

In this case, the chosen vertices are 1 and 3. According to the problem description, we can choose up to 2 additional vertices. However, the program does not account for the fact that choosing vertex 2 would allow us to form 2 triangles (1-2-3 and 1-3-2), whereas the current implementation only considers the minimum of `x + y - 2` and `n - 2`, which in this case would be 2. 

To fix this, the program needs to check if there are any gaps of length 2 between the chosen vertices and account for these gaps properly. The current implementation does not handle this scenario correctly.
