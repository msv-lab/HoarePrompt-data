Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is the total sum of all elements in `tmp` where `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even and equals 2 modulo 2, plus any additional increment of 1 if `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` equals 2, and `y` is the remaining value after subtracting `i - 1` from it as many times as possible within each iteration of the loop, or it remains unchanged if the loop breaks early; `ans` is incremented by `x + y - 2`, `ii` is `k + 1`, `tt` is the same as before; `tmp` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(a)):
    if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1
    elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0:
        tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers. If the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]` is 2, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, if the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]` is not 2 but is even, then `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2 and `a` is a list of integers. If the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is 2, then `ans` is increased by 1. If the difference is even but not 2, a list `tmp` is created containing the value `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`. If the difference is not even, no new list `tmp` is created.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `a` is a list of integers. If `a[3] - a[2] == 2`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, if `(a[3] - a[2]) % 2 == 0`, then `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`. If `(a[3] - a[2]) % 2 != 0`, then `tmp` is not defined.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
