Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution attempts to solve the problem but contains several logical errors and does not correctly maximize the number of triangular pieces of cake. Hereâ€™s why the solution is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Triangles:**
   - The logic to calculate the number of triangles formed by choosing additional vertices is flawed. Specifically, the code does not properly account for the gaps between the chosen vertices and how these gaps can be filled to form triangles.

2. **Handling Gaps Between Chosen Vertices:**
   - The code checks if the gap between consecutive chosen vertices is exactly 2 or even, but it does not handle the general case where the gap can be larger. It also does not correctly manage the wrap-around condition (i.e., the gap between the first and last chosen vertex).

3. **Incorrect Use of `y`:**
   - The variable `y` is used to represent the number of additional vertices that can be chosen. However, the logic to update `y` and use it to form triangles is not correct. The code tries to add `i` to `ans` when `y >= i - 1`, but this does not guarantee the formation of the maximum number of triangles.

4. **Final Answer Calculation:**
   - The final answer is calculated as `min(ans, n - 2)`, which is not always correct. The number of triangles should be maximized based on the available vertices, not just capped at `n - 2`.

To correctly solve this problem, one needs to use a more sophisticated approach, such as dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm that properly handles the gaps between chosen vertices and forms the maximum number of triangles. The current solution does not achieve this and hence is incorrect.
