Postcondition: `ans` is increased by `i` if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`. If the condition `y >= i - 1` is met, `y` is updated to `y - (i - 1)`. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `i` becomes the next element in `tmp`, and `tmp` is the list without the current element `i`.
