Output State: **We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or switch statement. Since there are no loops or conditions in the initial state, the only effect of the `break` statement is to indicate that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. No variables are affected by this statement.
