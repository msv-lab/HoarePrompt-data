Output State: **`tmp` contains the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, `i` is 1, `len(a)` is at least 1, and `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is not equal to 2. The current value of `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to the list `tmp`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is 1, `len(a)` is at least 1, and `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is not equal to 2, and the difference is even, the updated state includes `tmp` containing the computed value, while the other conditions remain unchanged.
