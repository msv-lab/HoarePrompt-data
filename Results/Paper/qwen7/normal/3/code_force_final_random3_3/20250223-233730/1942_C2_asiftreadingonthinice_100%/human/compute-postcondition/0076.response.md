Output State: **`i` is 1; `a` is a list of integers where the difference between the first two elements is 2; `ans` is 1.**

The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Since `ans` was initially not specified in the initial state, we assume it was 0 (as it is a common default value for such operations). After the increment, `ans` becomes 1. The values of `i` and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
