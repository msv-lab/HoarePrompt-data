Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in tmp`. This means the only variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `tmp`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `tmp` to iterate over.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is increased by `i` if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`.
   - Otherwise, the loop breaks out.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues based on the presence of elements in `tmp`, the only variable that needs adjustment is `i` (the current element being processed in the loop).
   - `tmp` should be adjusted to remove the current element `i` that was just processed.
   - `ans` and `y` remain unchanged unless they were modified within the loop body, but since the problem does not specify any changes to these variables within the loop body, we assume they remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Given the above points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `i` is the next element in `tmp` (which was previously removed from `tmp`).
- `tmp` is the list without the current element `i`.

Since the exact value of `i` and the updated `tmp` cannot be determined without the loop body, we can only state the general form of the adjustments.

**State: **`ans` is increased by `i` if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `i` is the next element in `tmp`, `tmp` is the list without the current element `i`**.
