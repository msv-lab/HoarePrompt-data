Output State: **`minn` is the minimum of `minn` and 1; `same` is 1; `num` remains unchanged; `i` is increased by 1 and is now less than `len(ar)`**

Explanation: The variable `same` is assigned the value `1`. The other variables (`minn`, `num`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `minn` is updated to be the minimum of its original value and `1`, and `same` is explicitly set to `1`. The condition that `i` is increased by 1 and is still less than `len(ar)` is preserved.
