Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the function `func` is flawed and does not accurately determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

Here's why the current implementation is incorrect:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Minimum Length of Consecutive Same Elements**: The code attempts to find the minimum length of consecutive same elements but does not handle the removal of these elements correctly.
2. **Misunderstanding the Operation**: The problem requires removing elements to break the beauty condition, not just finding the minimum length of consecutive same elements.
3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The code does not properly handle edge cases where the array might already be in a state where it cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.

To correctly solve this problem, one needs to identify segments of the array where the beauty condition can be broken by removing the minimum number of elements. Here is a corrected approach:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Find the longest segment where the beauty condition holds
        max_beauty_segment = 0
        current_segment = 1
        
        for i in range(1, n-1):
            if ar[i-1] == ar[i+1]:
                current_segment += 1
            else:
                max_beauty_segment = max(max_beauty_segment, current_segment)
                current_segment = 1
        
        max_beauty_segment = max(max_beauty_segment, current_segment)
        
        # If the entire array is beautiful, it cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements
        if max_beauty_segment == n-1:
            print(-1)
        else:
            # The minimum number of elements to remove is the total length minus the maximum beauty segment
            print(n - max_beauty_segment - 1)

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected version identifies the longest segment where the beauty condition holds and calculates the minimum number of elements to remove accordingly.
