Output State: `i` is equal to the length of the list `ar`, `same` is the maximum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list `ar`, `num` is the last number in the list `ar` that had the highest count of consecutive occurrences, and `minn` is the minimum value between `infinity` and the maximum `same` value found during the loop execution.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of the list `ar` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches the end of the list. The variable `same` will hold the highest count of consecutive occurrences of any single number in the list. The variable `num` will be set to the number that has the highest count of consecutive occurrences. Finally, `minn` will be the smallest value between `infinity` (if no updates occurred) and the highest `same` value found during the loop.
