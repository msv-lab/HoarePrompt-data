The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Given the initial conditions, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`, and `i` starts from an index such that the conditions for `minn` and `same` are met. After incrementing `i`, the new value of `i` will be one more than its previous value, but the conditions for `minn` and `same` remain the same unless the current element `ar[i]` is checked against `num`.

Output State: **`minn` is either 1 or the minimum value found in the list `ar` starting from index 1, `same` is 4 if the current element matches the first element, otherwise it is 2, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, and `i` is incremented by 1.**
