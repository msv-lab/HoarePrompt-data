Output State: **`i` is 2, `same` is 2, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is infinity, and `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The variable `same` is incremented by 1, so `same` becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged, including `i` which is updated to 2 since `same` was incremented from 1 to 2.
