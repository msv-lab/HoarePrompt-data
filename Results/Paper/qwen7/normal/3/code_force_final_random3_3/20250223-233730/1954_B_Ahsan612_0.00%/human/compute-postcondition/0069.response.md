Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is 3
- `same` is either incremented by 1 if `ar[2]` is equal to `num`, or remains 1 if it is not
- `num` is either the first element of `ar` or the second element of `ar` depending on the condition

### Loop Condition:
```python
while i < len(ar):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop continues as long as `i` is less than the length of `ar`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 4 (since `i` starts from 3 and increments by 1 each time through the loop).
- The values of `same` and `num` do not affect the loop condition directly; they are part of the loop body logic.

### Conclusion:
- We need to increment `i` to 4 for the loop to continue.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 4, `same` is either incremented by 1 if `ar[2]` is equal to `num`, or remains 1 if it is not, and `num` is either the first element of `ar` or the second element of `ar` depending on the condition**
