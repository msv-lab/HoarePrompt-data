Output State: **`minn` is either 1 or the minimum value found in the list `ar` starting from index 1, `same` is 1 or 2 depending on whether the current element matches the first element, `num` is now the value of `ar[i]`, `i` is increased by 1 and is now less than `len(ar)`**.

This means that the value of `num` has been updated to the value of the current element in the list `ar` at index `i`. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
