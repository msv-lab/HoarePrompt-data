Output State: **`i` is either 6 or 7, `same` is at least 1, `minn` is the minimum between `minn` and `same`, `num` is equal to `ar[i]`, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 6.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `ar[i]` to the variable `num`. Since `i` is either 6 or 7, `num` will take the value of `ar[6]` or `ar[7]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
