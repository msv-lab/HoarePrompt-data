Output State: **`i` is 4; `same` is incremented by 1.**

Given the initial state where `i` is 4, `same` is either incremented by 1 if `ar[2]` is equal to `num`, or remains 1 if it is not, and `num` is either the first element of `ar` or the second element of `ar` depending on the condition, the code `same += 1` increments the value of `same` by 1. Since the exact values of `ar` and `num` are not specified, we know that `same` will be its original value (either 1 or 2) plus 1, making it 2 in both cases. Therefore, the updated value of `same` is incremented by 1, while `i` remains unchanged.
