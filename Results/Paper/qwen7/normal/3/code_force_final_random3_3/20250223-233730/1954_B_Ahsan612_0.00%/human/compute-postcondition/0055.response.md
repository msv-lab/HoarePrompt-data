Output State: **`minn` is set to infinity, `ar` is a list of integers created from input, `i` is 1, `same` is 1, `num` is now the first element of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum value between infinity and the maximum `same` value found during the loop execution, and `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The line `i = 1` simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `i`. This does not affect any other variables or their values. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the updated value of `i`.
