Output State: **`i` is 5, `same` is either incremented by 1 if `ar[2]` is equal to `num`, or remains 1 if it is not, and `num` is either the first element of `ar` or the second element of `ar` depending on the condition**.

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 4 to 5. The conditions for `same` and `num` remain unchanged as the code only modifies `i`. Therefore, `same` is either incremented by 1 if `ar[2]` is equal to `num`, or remains 1 if it is not, and `num` is either the first element of `ar` or the second element of `ar` depending on the condition.
