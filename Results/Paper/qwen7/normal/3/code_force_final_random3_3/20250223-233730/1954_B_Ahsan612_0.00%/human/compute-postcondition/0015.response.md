Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[2]`, `minn` is 1**.

Explanation: The code updates `minn` to be the minimum of its current value (`infinity`) and `same` (which is 1). Since 1 is less than infinity, `minn` is updated to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
