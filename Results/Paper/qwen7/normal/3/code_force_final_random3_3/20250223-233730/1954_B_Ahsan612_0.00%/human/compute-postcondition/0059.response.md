Output State: **`same` is incremented by 1, `minn` is the minimum value between infinity and the maximum `same` value found during the loop execution, `ar` is a list of integers created from input, `i` is 2, `num` is now the first element of `ar`, and the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The line `same += 1` increments the value of `same` by 1. All other variables remain in their previous states. The value of `minn` remains as the minimum value between infinity and the maximum `same` value found during the loop execution, `ar` is still a list of integers created from input, `i` is still 2, `num` is still the first element of `ar`, and the current value of `ar[i]` (which is `ar[2]`) is still equal to `num`.
