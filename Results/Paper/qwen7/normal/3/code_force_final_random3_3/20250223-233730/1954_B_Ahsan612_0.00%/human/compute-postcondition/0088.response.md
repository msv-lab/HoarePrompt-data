Output State: **`minn` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `same`; `num` is set to the last `min(minn, same)` value found; `same` is 1 if no further elements were matched after setting `num` to the last `min(minn, same)` value.**

Explanation: The line `minn = min(minn, same)` updates `minn` to be the minimum value between its current value (`minn`) and the value of `same`. The variable `num` is set to the last value of `min(minn, same)`. After setting `num`, `same` is updated to 1 if no further elements were matched. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
