Output State: **`ar` is a list of integers created from input, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `same` is 1, `num` is the last number in `ar` that had the highest count of consecutive occurrences, `minn` is the minimum value between `infinity` and the maximum `same` value found during the loop execution, and `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The line `same = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `same`. This does not affect the values of `ar`, `i`, `num`, `minn`, or `n`. The value of `same` is now explicitly set to 1. All other variables retain their previous values.
