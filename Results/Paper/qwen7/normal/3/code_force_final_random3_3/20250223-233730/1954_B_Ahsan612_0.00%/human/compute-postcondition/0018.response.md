Postcondition: `i` is 2, `same` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `ar[i]` equals `num` or not, `num` is either the first element of the list `ar` or the third element of the list `ar`, `minn` is either infinity or 1, and `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
