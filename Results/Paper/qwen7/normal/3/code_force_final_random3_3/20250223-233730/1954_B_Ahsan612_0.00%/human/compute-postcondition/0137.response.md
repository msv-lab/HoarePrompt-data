Based on the initial state provided:

- `minn` is the minimum value between the initial value of `minn` (either 1 or the minimum value found in the list `ar` starting from index 1) and `same`.
- `same` is the total number of consecutive occurrences of the first element in the list `ar`.
- `num` is the last element of the list `ar` that was checked (which will be different from the first element if there was a change).
- `i` is equal to `len(ar)`.
- The current value of `minn` is infinity.

The print statement is simply `print(-1)`. This statement does not depend on any of the variables `minn`, `same`, `num`, or `i`. It directly prints the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
