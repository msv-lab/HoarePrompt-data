Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `same` is 1, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is infinity.**

The code initializes `minn` to infinity (represented as `inf` in Python). This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `ar`, `same`, or `num`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
