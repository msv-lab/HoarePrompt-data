t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000. a_1, a_2, ..., a_n and b_1, b_2, ..., b_n are lists of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9 for all i. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
