Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the new input string, `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`. If `s` contains exactly one instance of '11' and `count_1` equals 2, no changes are made. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `n`, `s`, and `count_1` remain unchanged.
