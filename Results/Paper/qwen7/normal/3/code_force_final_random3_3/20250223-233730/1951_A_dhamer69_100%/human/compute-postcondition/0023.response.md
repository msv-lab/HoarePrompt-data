Based on the initial state provided:

- `start` and `end` are integers (their specific values are not needed for this particular print statement).
- `t` is greater than 0 (its value is not needed).
- `n` is an input integer (its value is not needed).
- `s` is a string input by the user (its value is not needed, but it is described in the conditions).
- `n` is not equal to 2 (its value is not needed).
- `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in the string `s` and is even (the value of `count_1` is 2 based on the conditions).
- The string `s` contains exactly one instance of '11' and the count of '1' in `s` is 2.

The print statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement will simply print the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
