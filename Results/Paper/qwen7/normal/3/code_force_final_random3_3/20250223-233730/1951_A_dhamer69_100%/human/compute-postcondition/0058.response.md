Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s` is a new input string.
- `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement will print the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `s`, and `count_1`.

Output: **NO**
