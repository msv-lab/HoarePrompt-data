t is a positive integer, and for each test case, n, m, and k are positive integers with the constraints 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ m, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. The list a contains n strictly increasing integers within the range [1, 2 ⋅ 10^9], the list d contains m integers within the range [1, 10^9], and the list f contains k integers within the range [1, 10^9]. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^5, the sum of m across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of k across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
