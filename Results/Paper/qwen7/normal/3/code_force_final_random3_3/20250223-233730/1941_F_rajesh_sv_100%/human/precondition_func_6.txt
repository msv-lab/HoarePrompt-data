(n, m, k) are positive integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= m, k <= 2 * 10^5; A is a list of n strictly increasing integers where 1 <= A[i] <= 2 * 10^9; D is a list of unique integers obtained by sorting the list of m integers d_i (1 <= d_i <= 10^9); F is a list of k integers representing the complexities of the functions (1 <= f_i <= 10^9).
