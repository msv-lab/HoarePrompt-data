Output State: **The loop terminates when `l` is no longer less than `h`. At this point, `l` will be the smallest index such that `D[l] + f >= left` and `h` will be the largest index such that `D[h-1] + f < right`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `l` will be the smallest index in the list `D` where the element plus `f` is greater than or equal to `left`. The variable `h` will be the largest index in the list `D` minus one, where the element plus `f` is strictly less than `right`. This means that `l` points to the first element that satisfies the condition, and `h` points just before the last element that does not satisfy the condition.
