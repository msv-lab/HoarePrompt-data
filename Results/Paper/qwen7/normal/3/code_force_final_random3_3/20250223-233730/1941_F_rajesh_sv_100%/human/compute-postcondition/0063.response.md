Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information
- The loop condition is `while l < h`.
- At the end of the previous iteration:
  - `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`
  - `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`
  - `mid` is `l` + (`h` - `l`) // 2
  - If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1`.
  - Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid`, and `l` remains the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F[0]` and must be less than `h`.

### Analysis
- The loop will continue as long as `l < h`.
- To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to guarantee that `l < h` at the start of the next iteration.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment
1. **Initial Values**: 
   - `mid` is calculated as `l` + (`h` - `l`) // 2.
   - `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are computed based on the current values of `mid` and `mid + 1`.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid`.

3. **Ensuring `l < h`**:
   - For the loop to continue, `l` must be less than `h`.
   - If `l` is updated to `mid + 1`, then `l` becomes `mid + 1`.
   - If `h` is updated to `mid`, then `h` becomes `mid`.

### Conclusion
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `l < h` at the start of the next iteration. This means either `l` should not be equal to `h` (which it won't be because the loop condition is `l < h`), or both `l` and `h` should be such that `l < h`.

Given the conditions provided, we need to ensure that `l` and `h` are set up correctly to maintain `l < h`.

### Final Answer
State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is `l` + (`h` - `l`) // 2, `l` must be less than `h`**
