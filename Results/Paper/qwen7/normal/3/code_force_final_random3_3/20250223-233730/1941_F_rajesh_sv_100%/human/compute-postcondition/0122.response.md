Output State: **`mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` is equal to `mid + 1`, `h` is strictly greater than `l`, `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`**

Explanation: 
- The line `l = mid + 1` updates the value of `l` to be `mid + 1`.
- The values of `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `h`, and the expression for updating `mid` remain unchanged from the initial state.
