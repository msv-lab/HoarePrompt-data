The function does not accept any direct parameters. Instead, it relies on predefined variables and lists (t, n, m, k, a, d, f) with specific constraints. After executing, it returns an integer value calculated by calling another function `func_2()`. This returned integer will fall within the range defined by the initial state constraints.
