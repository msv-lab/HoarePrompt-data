Postcondition: `max_diff` is the maximum difference found so far, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference found so far (or -inf if no such difference exists), `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurred (or None if not applicable), `i` is 7. If `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is updated to `diff`. Otherwise, `next_max_diff` remains unchanged.
