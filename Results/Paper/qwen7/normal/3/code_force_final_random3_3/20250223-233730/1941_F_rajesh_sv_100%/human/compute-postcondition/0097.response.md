Output State: **`mid_sum` is updated to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is updated to `D[mid + 1] + f`, `ans` remains unchanged, `l` and `h` remain unchanged, `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `left` remains unchanged, `right` remains unchanged, `f` remains unchanged, `D` remains unchanged, and `l < h` must still hold true.**

This means that the values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` have been updated according to the given expressions, while all other variables (`ans`, `l`, `h`, `mid`, `left`, `right`, `f`, and `D`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition `l < h` is still true.
