Output State: **`mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` is equal to `mid + 1`, `mid` is equal to `l + (h - l) // 2`, and the difference between `mid_sum` and `left` is less than the difference between `right` and `mid_next_sum`.**

Explanation: The code `l = mid + 1` updates the value of `l` to be `mid + 1`. All other variables (`mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `mid`, and the condition involving `left` and `right`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
