Output State: **`h` is the index of the element in `D` that is strictly less than `right - f`, and `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F[0]`.**

Explanation: The code `h = bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1` calculates the index `h` of the element in list `D` that is strictly less than `right - f`. The variable `l` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F[0]`.
