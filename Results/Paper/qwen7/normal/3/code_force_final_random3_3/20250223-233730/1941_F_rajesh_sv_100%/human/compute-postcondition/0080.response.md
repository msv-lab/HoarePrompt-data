Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and the maximum of (D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f) with the next value of `f`, `l` must be less than `bisect_left(D, right - f)`, and `h` is set to `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`; `mid` is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`; `mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` as `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f` respectively, where `mid` is the middle index between `l` and `h`. The values of `ans`, `f`, `l`, `h`, `D`, `left`, `right`, and `mid` remain unchanged from their previous state.
