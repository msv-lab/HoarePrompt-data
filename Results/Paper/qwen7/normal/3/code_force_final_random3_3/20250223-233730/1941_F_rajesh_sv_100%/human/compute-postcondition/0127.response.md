Output State: **`mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` is either equal to `mid + 1` or `mid`, `h` must be strictly greater than `l`, `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `mid` to `l + (h - l) // 2`. The other variables (`mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `l`, `h`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `mid` is now calculated based on the current values of `l` and `h`.
