Output State: **`max_diff` is the maximum difference found so far, `next_max_diff` is A[6] - A[5], `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurred (or None if not applicable), `i` is 7**.

Explanation: The code sets `next_max_diff` to the value of `diff`, which is `A[6] - A[5]`. The other variables (`max_diff`, `index`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
