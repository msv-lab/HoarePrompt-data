You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, x, and y are integers such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and y = 0. The input also includes a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, and the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.

        #State: Output State: `t` is equal to 0; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the input split, `x` is the integer value of the second element of the input split, `y` is the integer value of the third element of the input split, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from converting the first `x` elements of the input split into integers.
        #
        #This output state occurs because the loop continues to execute as long as `t > 0`. After each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1. Therefore, if the loop executes all its iterations, `t` will eventually reach 0. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their last state within the loop, as these values are determined by the input during each iteration and not modified within the loop itself.
    #State: `t` is equal to 0, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the input split, `x` is the integer value of the second element of the input split, `y` is the integer value of the third element of the input split, and `arr` is a list of integers obtained from converting the first `x` elements of the input split into integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads integers t, n, x, and y (where t is a positive integer up to 10^4, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and the minimum of n or 2⋅10^5, and y is always 0), along with a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n. It then prints x - 2 for each test case. After processing all test cases, it ensures that the variable t is set to 0.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. According to the problem, the goal is to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by choosing no more than `y` additional vertices. However, the program simply prints `x - 2`, which is incorrect.

To understand why this is incorrect, consider the following:

1. **Number of Triangles**: For a polygon with `n` sides, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is `n - 2`. This is because each triangle uses up 3 sides, and after forming `n - 2` triangles, all sides are used up.

2. **Given Vertices**: Bessie has already chosen `x` vertices. The program should calculate how many more vertices can be added to form the maximum number of triangles. Since `y = 0` in this version, no additional vertices can be chosen, so the maximum number of triangles is simply the number of triangles that can be formed using the `x` chosen vertices.

However, the program incorrectly calculates the result as `x - 2` regardless of the values of `n` and `x`. This is clearly wrong because it does not take into account the total number of sides (`n`) and the fact that the maximum number of triangles is `n - 2`.

A correct solution would involve checking if the chosen vertices can form triangles and then calculating the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using these vertices and no additional vertices since `y = 0`.

For example, in the first test case:
- `n = 8`, `x = 4`, `y = 0`
- Chosen vertices: `[1, 6, 2, 5]`
- The program outputs `4 - 2 = 2`, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be `2` because the chosen vertices can form 2 triangles without needing any additional vertices.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem and is therefore incorrect.
