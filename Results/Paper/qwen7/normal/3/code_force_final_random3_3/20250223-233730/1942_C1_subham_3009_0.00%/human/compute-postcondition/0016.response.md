Output State: **`t` is now greater than 0 - 1, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the input split, `x` is the integer value of the second element of the input split, `y` is the integer value of the third element of the input split, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from converting the first `x` elements of the input split into integers, `[n, x, y]` is a list containing the integer values of the first, second, and third elements of the input split respectively.**

Explanation: The code `map(int, input().split())` takes the input, splits it into elements, and converts each element to an integer. The resulting three integers are assigned to `n`, `x`, and `y` respectively. The list `arr` is created by converting the first `x` elements of the input split into integers. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
