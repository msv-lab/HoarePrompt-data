Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 9999, inclusive; `n` is the first integer entered, `x` is the second integer entered, `y` is the third integer entered; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from converting the first `x` elements of the original list of strings.**

Explanation: The code converts the first `x` elements of the list `arr` (which was originally a list of strings) into integers and assigns them back to `arr`. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
