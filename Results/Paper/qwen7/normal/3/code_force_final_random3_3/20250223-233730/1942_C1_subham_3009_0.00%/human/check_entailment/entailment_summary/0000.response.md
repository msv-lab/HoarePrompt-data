Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.
2. Given that \( y = 0 \), we cannot add any additional vertices.
3. To maximize the number of triangular pieces, we need to use the chosen vertices to form as many triangles as possible.
4. The key insight is that with \( x \) chosen vertices, the maximum number of triangles that can be formed is \( x - 2 \). This is because a triangulation of a polygon with \( k \) vertices results in \( k - 2 \) triangles.
5. The provided program correctly calculates \( x - 2 \) for each test case, which matches the expected output based on the problem statement.

Given the above points, the program logic is correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
