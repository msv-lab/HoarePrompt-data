Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic**: The program simply prints `x - 2` for every test case. This logic is incorrect because the number of triangular pieces that can be formed depends on the number of vertices chosen (`x`) and the number of additional vertices that can be chosen (`y`). 

2. **No Consideration of `y`**: The variable `y` is defined but not used in the program. The problem states that you can choose up to `y` additional vertices, but the program does not account for this.

3. **Max Triangles Calculation**: The maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces that can be formed from `x` chosen vertices is given by `x - 2`. However, the program should consider whether adding any of the `y` additional vertices can increase the number of triangles. If `x < n - 2`, then the maximum number of triangles is `x - 2`. If `x >= n - 2`, then the maximum number of triangles is `(n - 2)`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        t = int(input())
        while t > 0:
            t -= 1
            [n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())
            # Calculate the maximum number of triangles
            max_triangles = min(x - 2, n - 2)
            print(max_triangles)

func()
```

This corrected program properly calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces that can be formed based on the given constraints.
