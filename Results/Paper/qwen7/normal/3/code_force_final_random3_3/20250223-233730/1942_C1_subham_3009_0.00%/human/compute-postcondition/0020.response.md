Output State: `t` is equal to 0; `n` is the integer value of the first element of the input split, `x` is the integer value of the second element of the input split, `y` is the integer value of the third element of the input split, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from converting the first `x` elements of the input split into integers.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will be reduced to 0 since it starts as an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` will remain as they were set on the last iteration, and `arr` will also retain the last list of integers obtained from the input.
