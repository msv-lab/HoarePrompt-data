Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the input split, `x` is the integer value of the second element of the input split, `y` is the integer value of the third element of the input split, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from converting the first `x` elements of the input split.**

Explanation: The code `arr = input().split()` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, and assigns it to `arr`. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. `arr` is updated to be a list of the first `x` elements from the split input, converted to integers.
