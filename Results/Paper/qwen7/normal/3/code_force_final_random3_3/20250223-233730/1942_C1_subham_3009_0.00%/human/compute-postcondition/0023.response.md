Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes integers t, n, x, and y (where t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and y is always 0), along with a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. It then returns a result based on the given conditions for each test case.**

Note: The actual logic of processing the test cases and determining the return value is not described here as per the instructions.
