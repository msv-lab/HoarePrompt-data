Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `p` is a list of `n` integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ `n` and `p_i` ≠ `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct; `v` is a list of length `n+1` where the first element is 0 and the next `n` elements are integers inputted from the user. If `n` equals 2, then `n` is 2 and `v` is a list of length 3 with the first element as 0 and the next two elements as integers inputted from the user. If `n` is between 3 and 50, `i` is 4, and the condition `v[v[v[4]]]` is not equal to 4.
