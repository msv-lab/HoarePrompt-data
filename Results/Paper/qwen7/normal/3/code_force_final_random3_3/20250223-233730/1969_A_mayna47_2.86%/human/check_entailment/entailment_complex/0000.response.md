Reasoning:
1. The program should handle multiple test cases, but the annotated program only shows the `func_1` function without showing how it processes multiple test cases. This suggests that the program might be missing the outer loop to process each test case.
2. The logic inside `func_1` seems to be flawed. Specifically:
   - For `n == 2`, the output should indeed be `2`, but the program does not correctly handle this case.
   - For `n > 2`, the program attempts to find a pair of friends `(i, v[v[i]])` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. However, this logic is incomplete and does not guarantee finding the minimum number of invitations needed.
   - The program incorrectly prints `3` in some cases where the correct answer could be `2`.

Given the above points, the program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of invitations required to have at least 2 friends come to the party. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
