Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is within the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be between 3 and 50 inclusive.
   - `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i`.

4. **Determine the Next Value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be 2.

5. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must still be within the range from 1 to `n`.
   - Given that `i` is now 2, `n` must still be between 3 and 50 inclusive.
   - The condition `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i` remains unchanged since `i` is only incremented and does not affect this condition directly.

6. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be updated to 2.
   - `n` must still be between 3 and 50 inclusive.
   - The condition `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be between 3 and 50 inclusive, and `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i`**.
