### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Friend List Initialization**: In `func_1()`, the program initializes a list `v` with zeros and then updates it with the input values. This is done correctly.
3. **Special Case Handling**: For `n == 2`, the program prints `2` which is correct because both friends need to be invited to ensure at least 2 friends come.
4. **Main Logic**:
   - The program checks if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends and are also best friends with each other indirectly (i.e., `v[v[v[i]]] == i`). If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and returns, which is correct.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`. However, this logic needs to be checked more carefully.
5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where multiple pairs might satisfy the condition but only checks for one specific pair.
   - The program does not ensure that the minimum number of invitations is always printed. For example, in the third test case, the program should check if inviting just one friend is enough, but it directly prints `2`.

### Analysis:
- The program fails to correctly handle cases where inviting just one friend is sufficient. For example, in the third test case (`2 1`), inviting just friend 1 would suffice, but the program incorrectly prints `2`.
- The logic for checking the condition `v[v[v[i]]] == i` is incomplete and does not cover all scenarios where inviting just one friend might be enough.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not always find the minimum number of invitations needed.

### Correctness:
**False**
