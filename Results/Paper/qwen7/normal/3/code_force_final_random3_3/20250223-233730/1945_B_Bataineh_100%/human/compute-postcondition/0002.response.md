Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The initial values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still an integer between 1 and 10^4, and `i` is still 0. The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are the integers input by the user.
