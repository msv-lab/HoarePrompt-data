Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `i` is equal to `t - 1`, `t` remains an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), and `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers assigned the values from the last iteration of the loop.**

In this final state, the variable `i` will have incremented to `t - 1` because the loop runs from `0` to `t-1`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was initially set and does not change within the loop. The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` will be those provided by the input for the last iteration of the loop.
