Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time. The logic in the `if-elif-else` block is flawed and does not account for all possible scenarios where the maximum number of fireworks can be seen simultaneously.

To solve this problem accurately, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`, which represents the interval at which both installations launch fireworks at the same time. We then need to consider how many fireworks can be visible within this interval, taking into account the visibility duration `m`.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        lcm = a * b // math.gcd(a, b)
        max_visible = 0
        
        # Calculate the number of fireworks from the first installation
        max_visible += (lcm + a - 1) // a
        
        # Calculate the number of fireworks from the second installation
        max_visible += (lcm + b - 1) // b
        
        # Subtract 2 because the fireworks launched at lcm are counted twice
        max_visible -= 2
        
        # Add the number of fireworks visible during the overlap period
        max_visible += (m + 1) // lcm
        
        print(max_visible)

func()
```

This solution correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time by considering the LCM of `a` and `b`, and adjusting for the overlap and individual counts.
