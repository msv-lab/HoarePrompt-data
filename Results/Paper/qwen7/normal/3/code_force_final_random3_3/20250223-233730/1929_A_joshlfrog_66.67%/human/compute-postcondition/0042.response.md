Output State: **`l` is a positive integer and at least 1, `nums[i]` is equal to `x`, and `x` holds the value of `nums[i]`.**

The code assigns the value of `nums[i]` to `x`. Since `nums[i]` was previously greater than `x`, after the assignment, `x` now holds the value of `nums[i]`. The values of `l` and the condition about `nums[i]` being greater than `x` are no longer applicable since `x` now equals `nums[i]`.
