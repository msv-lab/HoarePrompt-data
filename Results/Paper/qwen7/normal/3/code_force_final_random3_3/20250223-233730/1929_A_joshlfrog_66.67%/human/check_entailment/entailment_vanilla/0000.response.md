Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `l` and the array elements `nums`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Two variables `x` and `y` are initialized. `x` is set to `0`, and `y` is set to `100000000` (a large number).

3. **Finding Maximum and Minimum Values:**
   - The program iterates through the array `nums` and updates `x` to be the maximum value encountered so far.
   - Simultaneously, it updates `y` to be the minimum value encountered so far.

4. **Calculating Beauty:**
   - After the loop, the program calculates the difference `x - y` and prints it.

### Reasoning:

- The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`.
- To maximize this sum, we should arrange the array such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.
- The maximum possible difference between two numbers in the array is simply the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.
- Therefore, setting `x` to the maximum value and `y` to the minimum value in the array and calculating `x - y` gives us the maximum possible beauty.

### Example Walkthrough:

- **Test Case 1:** `[2, 1, 3]`
  - Maximum value (`x`) = 3
  - Minimum value (`y`) = 1
  - Beauty = `3 - 1 = 2`
  - The program correctly outputs `2`.

- **Test Case 2:** `[69, 69, 69]`
  - Maximum value (`x`) = 69
  - Minimum value (`y`) = 69
  - Beauty = `69 - 69 = 0`
  - The program correctly outputs `0`.

- **Test Case 3:** `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`
  - Maximum value (`x`) = 100
  - Minimum value (`y`) = 43
  - Beauty = `100 - 43 = 57`
  - The program correctly outputs `57`.

- **Test Case 4:** `[3, 4, 3, 3]`
  - Maximum value (`x`) = 4
  - Minimum value (`y`) = 3
  - Beauty = `4 - 3 = 1`
  - The program correctly outputs `1`.

- **Test Case 5:** `[2, 1]`
  - Maximum value (`x`) = 2
  - Minimum value (`y`) = 1
  - Beauty = `2 - 1 = 1`
  - The program correctly outputs `1`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
