You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        x = 0
        
        y = 100000000
        
        for i in range(l):
            if nums[i] > x:
                x = nums[i]
            if nums[i] < y:
                y = nums[i]
        
        print(x - y)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `e` will be equal to `t-1` (since the loop runs from `e` in range `t`), `l` is the length of the list `nums`, `x` is the maximum value in the list `nums`, and `y` is the minimum value in the list `nums`.
    #
    #Explanation:
    #- The variable `t` remains within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 500\) as it was initially set.
    #- The variable `e` will be equal to `t-1` because the loop runs from `e` in the range `t`.
    #- The variable `l` is set to the length of the list `nums` when the loop starts.
    #- The variable `x` is updated during each iteration to hold the maximum value encountered in the list `nums`.
    #- The variable `y` is updated during each iteration to hold the minimum value encountered in the list `nums`.
    #
    #After all iterations of the loop, `x` will contain the highest value in the list `nums`, and `y` will contain the lowest value in the list `nums`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data where t is a positive integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and for each test case, n is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n each between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The function returns different outputs based on the input data.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
