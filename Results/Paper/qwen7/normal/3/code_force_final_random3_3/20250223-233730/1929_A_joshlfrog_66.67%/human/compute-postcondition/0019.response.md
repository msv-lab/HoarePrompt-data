Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `e` is 0, `l` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `x` is the value of `nums[i]`, and `y` is the minimum value between the original `y` and `nums[i]`. If `nums[i] > x`, then `x` is updated to `nums[i]`.
