Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i`, `l`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is not initialized in the loop head; it will be set to 0 initially.
   - `l` is given as an input integer.
3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < l`.

Given this information, we need to ensure that the loop can start executing. This means that `l` must be a positive integer (since `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, we can use `l` directly).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `l` (it must be a positive integer) and `i` (it will be set to 0 initially).

Here is the final state:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `e` is 0, `l` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `x` is 0, `y` is 100000000, `i` is 0**
