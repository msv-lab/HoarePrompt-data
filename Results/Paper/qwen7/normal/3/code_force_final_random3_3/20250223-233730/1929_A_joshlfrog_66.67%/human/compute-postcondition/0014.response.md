Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `e` is 0, `l` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `x` is the value of `nums[i]`, `y` is the value of `nums[i]`, `i` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `y = nums[i]` assigns the value of `nums[i]` to `y`. Since the current value of `nums[i]` is less than `y`, and `y` was previously set to 100000000, the value of `y` is updated to the current value of `nums[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
