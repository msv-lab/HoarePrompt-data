Output State: **The variable `i` is equal to `l-1`, `l` is greater than 0, `x` is the maximum value in the list `nums`, and `y` is the minimum value in the list `nums`.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have the value `l-1` (since it increments with each iteration), `l` will still be greater than 0 (as long as there were elements in the list to iterate over), `x` will hold the highest number found in the list `nums`, and `y` will hold the lowest number found in the list `nums`.
