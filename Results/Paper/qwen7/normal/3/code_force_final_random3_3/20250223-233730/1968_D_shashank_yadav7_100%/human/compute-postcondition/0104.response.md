Based on the initial state provided:

- `k` is `-n`
- `b` is `p[b] - n`
- `s` is `p[s] - n`
- `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp` after the last iteration
- `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`
- `sp` is `a[s] + sp + n * a[s]`
- `bp` is `a[b] + bp + n * a[b]`
- `i` is `n`

The `print('Bodya')` statement simply prints the string `'Bodya'`.

Output: **'Bodya'**
