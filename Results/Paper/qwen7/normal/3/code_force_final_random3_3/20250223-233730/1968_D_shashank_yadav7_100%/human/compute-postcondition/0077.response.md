Output State: **`k` is 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is max(`sm`, `a[s] * k + sp`), `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp`**.

Explanation: The variable `bp` is incremented by `a[b]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
