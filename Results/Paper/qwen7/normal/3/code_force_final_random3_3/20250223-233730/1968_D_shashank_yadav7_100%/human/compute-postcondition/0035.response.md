Output State: **`i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block (like an `if` statement) that the `break` is associated with, it simply indicates that we would exit the most internal loop or conditional block if one existed. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged.
