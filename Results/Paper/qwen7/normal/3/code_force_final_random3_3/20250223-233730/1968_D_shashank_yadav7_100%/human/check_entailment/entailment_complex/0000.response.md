Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, and adjusts `P_B` and `P_S` to be zero-indexed.
3. It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
4. The program initializes `bm` and `sm` with the initial scores of Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
5. It then enters a loop that simulates up to `k` turns, updating the positions of Bodya and Sasha according to the rules of the game.
6. During each iteration, it updates `bm` and `sm` to reflect the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha, considering their potential moves.
7. After the loop, it compares `bm` and `sm` and prints the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program seems to follow the rules of the game correctly and should produce the expected results for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
