Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` is a positive integer, `p[b]` is decremented by 1, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp + a[s]`, `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `bp` is increased by `a[b]`**.

Explanation: The code `bp += a[b]` increments the value of `bp` by the value of `a[b]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
