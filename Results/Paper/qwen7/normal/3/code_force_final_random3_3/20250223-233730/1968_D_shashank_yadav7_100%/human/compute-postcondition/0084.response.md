Output State: **`k` is -1, `b` is `p[b] - 1 - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1 - 1`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is max(`sm`, `a[s] * k + sp`), `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp`, `i` is `i_prev + 2`, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.**

Explanation: The code `s = p[s] - 1` updates the value of `s` to `p[s] - 1`. Since the initial state of `s` was `p[s] - 1`, the new value of `s` becomes `p[s] - 1 - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The most internal loop or if statement is also broken out.
