Output State: **`i` is -1, `n` is a positive integer, `p[b]` is decreased by 1, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp + a[s]`, `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `bp` is `bp + a[b]`, `sp` is increased by `a[s]`.**

Explanation: The code `sp += a[s]` increases the value of `sp` by `a[s]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
