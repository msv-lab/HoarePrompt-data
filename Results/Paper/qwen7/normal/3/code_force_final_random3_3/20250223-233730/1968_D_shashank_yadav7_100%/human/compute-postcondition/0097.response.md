Output State: **`k` is -2, `b` is `p[b] - 2`, `s` is `p[s] - 2`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is max(`sm`, `a[s] * k + sp`), `sp` is `a[s] + sp + 2 * a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp + a[b]`, `sm` is updated to max(`sm`, `a[s] * k + sp`)**

Explanation: The code updates `sm` to the maximum value between its current value and `a[s] * k + sp`. Given the initial conditions, `sm` is updated based on the new expression, but the other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
