Output State: **`k` is -1, `b` is `p[b] - 1 - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1 - 1`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is max(`sm`, `a[s] * k + sp`), `sp` is `a[s] + sp + 2 * a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp + a[b]`, `i` is `i_prev + 2`.**

Explanation: The line `bp += a[b]` adds the value of `a[b]` to `bp`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `bp` is updated to `a[b] + bp + a[b]`, and `sp` is updated to `a[s] + sp + 2 * a[s]` since `2 * a[s]` is added to `sp`.
