Output State: **`k` is -2, `b` is `p[b] - 2`, `s` is `p[s] - 2`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is max(`sm`, `a[s] * k + sp`), `sp` is `a[s] + sp + 2 * a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp + a[b]`, `sm` is updated to max(`sm`, `a[s] * k + sp`).**

Explanation: The code `sp += a[s]` increments the value of `sp` by `a[s]`. Therefore, the new value of `sp` is `a[s] + sp + 2 * a[s] + a[s]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
