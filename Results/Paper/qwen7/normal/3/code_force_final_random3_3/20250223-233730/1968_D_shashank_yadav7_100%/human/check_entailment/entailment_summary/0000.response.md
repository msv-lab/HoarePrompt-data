Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the necessary parameters and initializes the starting positions for Bodya (`b`) and Sasha (`s`).
3. The program calculates the initial scores for Bodya (`sp`) and Sasha (`bp`).
4. It then enters a loop where it simulates the game for `k` turns, updating the positions and scores for both players.
5. During each turn, it checks if the remaining turns `k` are zero, and if so, breaks out of the loop early.
6. After the loop, it compares the final scores (`bm` and `sm`) and prints the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').

The logic in the program seems to correctly simulate the game according to the rules provided. The calculations for the maximum possible scores (`bm` and `sm`) and the comparisons at the end are also consistent with the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
