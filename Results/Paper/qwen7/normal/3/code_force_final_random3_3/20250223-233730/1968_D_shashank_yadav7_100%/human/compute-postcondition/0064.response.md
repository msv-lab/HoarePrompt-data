Output State: **`i` is `n`, `k` is 0, `b` is `input integer - 1`, `s` is `input integer - 1`, `bm` is the maximum value of `bm` and `a[s] * k + bp` after `n` iterations, `sm` is the maximum value of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp` after `n` iterations, `sp` is now equal to `a[s]`, `bp` is now equal to `a[b]`, `t` must be greater than `n`, `n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `bp` to be equal to `a[b]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
