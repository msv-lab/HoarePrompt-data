Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is -1
   - `n` is a positive integer
   - `p[b]` is decreased by 1
   - `s` is `p[s] - 1`
   - `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp + a[s]`
   - `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`
   - `bp` is `bp + a[b]`
   - `sp` is increased by `a[s]`
   - `bp` is increased by `a[b]`

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting the State:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`.
   - Since `i` starts from -1 and the loop runs from `range(n)`, the loop will execute if `i < n`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - After the previous iteration, `i` is -1.
   - For the next iteration, `i` needs to be 0 (since it increments by 1 each time the loop runs).

5. **Other Variables:**
   - The other variables (`n`, `p[b]`, `s`, `sm`, `bm`, `bp`, `sp`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `p[b]` is decreased by 1, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp + a[s]`, `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `bp` is `bp + a[b]`, `sp` is increased by `a[s]`**
