Output State: `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[b] - 2 * (n - 1)`, `s` is `p[s] - 2 * (n - 1)`, `bm` is the maximum of all values `a[b] * k + bp` from each iteration, `sm` is the maximum of all values `a[s] * k + sp` from each iteration, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` added `n - 1` times, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` added `n - 1` times.

In this final state, the variable `i` will be `n - 1` because the loop increments `i` at the start of each iteration. The variable `k` will be 0 as it is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The variables `b` and `s` will be adjusted by subtracting `2 * (n - 1)` because `b` and `s` are each decremented by 1 in every iteration of the loop. The `bm` and `sm` variables will hold the maximum values accumulated over all iterations, and `sp` and `bp` will be the cumulative sums of `a[s]` and `a[b]` respectively, each added `n - 1` times.
