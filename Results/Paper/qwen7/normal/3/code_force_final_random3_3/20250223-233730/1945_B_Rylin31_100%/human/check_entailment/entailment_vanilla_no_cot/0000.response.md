Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program is flawed. Specifically, the formula `m // a + m // b + 2` does not accurately calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.

To understand why, let's break down the correct approach:

1. **Finding Common Launch Times**: We need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine when both installations will launch fireworks at the same time.
2. **Counting Overlapping Fireworks**: We need to count how many fireworks are visible at any given time within the visibility period `m`.

The given solution tries to use integer division to estimate the number of fireworks but does not account for the overlapping periods correctly.

A correct approach would involve:
- Finding the LCM of `a` and `b`.
- Calculating the number of intervals of length `m` within the LCM period.
- Adjusting for the exact overlaps using the inclusion-exclusion principle.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = lcm(a, b)
        # Calculate the number of intervals of length m within the LCM period
        num_intervals = lcm_ab // (m + 1)
        # Each interval can have up to 2 fireworks (one from each installation)
        max_visible = num_intervals * 2
        # Add the fireworks launched exactly at the start of the period
        max_visible += min(a, b) <= m + 1
        print(max_visible)

func()
```

This corrected program should provide the right answer for the given problem.
