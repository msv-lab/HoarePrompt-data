Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The formula used in the program is \(m // a + m // b + 2\). Let's break down the logic:

1. **Calculation of Fireworks from Each Installation**: 
   - \(m // a\) gives the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the visibility period of \(m\) minutes.
   - \(m // b\) gives the number of fireworks launched by the second installation within the same period.
   
2. **Overlap Consideration**:
   - The term \(+2\) accounts for the fact that the first and last fireworks launched by each installation will overlap with the next and previous ones respectively, ensuring that there are always at least two fireworks visible at any point in time.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the formula \(m // a + m // b + 2\) is a correct approach to calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time. This formula correctly handles the periodicity and overlap of the fireworks from both installations.

The program correctly processes each test case by reading the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(m\) and applying the formula. It iterates over all test cases as required and prints the result for each case.

Therefore, the program logic matches the problem requirements and the provided example outputs confirm its correctness.

Correctness: **True**
