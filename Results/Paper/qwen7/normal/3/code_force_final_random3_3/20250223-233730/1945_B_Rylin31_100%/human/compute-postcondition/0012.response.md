Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes three integers t, a, and m for each test case, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^{18}. It returns a result based on the value of t, performing some unspecified operation involving a, b, and m for each test case.**

Note: The specific operations involving `a`, `b`, and `m` are not detailed here as they are not provided in the problem statement.
