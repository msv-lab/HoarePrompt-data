Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq x\), `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and 3, and `i` is 3, `ans` is updated to the maximum of `ans` and `x // 3`.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` to the maximum of its current value and `x // i`. Given that `i` is 3, `ans` is updated to the maximum of `ans` and `x // 3`. The other variables (`t`, `x`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
