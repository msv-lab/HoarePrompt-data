Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq x\), `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and \(x // 2\) (since `n <= x // 2`), and `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and `x // i`. Given that `i` is 2, `x // i` is equivalent to `x // 2`. Since the condition `n <= x // 2` is true, `ans` is updated to `max(ans, x // 2)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
