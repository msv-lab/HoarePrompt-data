Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\), `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq x\), `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and `x // 2` where `x` is divisible by 2, and `i` is 2; if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, `ans` is updated to be the maximum of `ans` and 2.
