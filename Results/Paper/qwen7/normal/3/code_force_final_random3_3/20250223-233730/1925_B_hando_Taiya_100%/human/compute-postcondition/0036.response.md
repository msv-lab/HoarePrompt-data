Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases through its constraints. For each test case, it takes three values: t (a positive integer between 1 and 10^3), x (a positive integer between 1 and 10^8), and n (a positive integer between 1 and x). The function returns a result based on the relationship between x, n, and t for each test case.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases where it accepts values for `t`, `x`, and `n` within specified ranges and returns a result for each case based on their relationships.
