Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer, and if `n` is odd, `n` remains odd. If `n` is even, `n` remains even, `s` is a string consisting of '110' repeated `n//2` times**.

Explanation: The code `s = '110' * (n // 2)` updates the value of `s` to be a string consisting of '110' repeated `n // 2` times. The conditions for `t`, `n`, and the property of `n` being odd or even remain unchanged. The length of `s` is now determined by `n // 2` repetitions of '110', which means the length of `s` is `3 * (n // 2)`. This length is either less than 200 or 200 or more, depending on the value of `n`.
