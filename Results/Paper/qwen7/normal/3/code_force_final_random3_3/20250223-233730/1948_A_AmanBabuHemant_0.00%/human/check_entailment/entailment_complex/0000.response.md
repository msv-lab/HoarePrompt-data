Reasoning:
- The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
- For each test case, it checks if `n` is odd or even.
- If `n` is odd, the function correctly prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have exactly `n` special characters when `n` is odd.
- If `n` is even, the function constructs a string `s` consisting of '110' repeated `n//2` times. This string will always have a length of `3 * (n // 2)`, which is at most 75 for `n <= 50`. Since 75 is much less than 200, the condition `if len(s) < 200:` will always be true for valid `n`.
- The function then prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string `s`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the function, the program correctly handles all cases as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
