Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.
3. The program checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to have exactly `n` special characters when `n` is odd (since a special character requires having exactly one neighbor of a different character, which cannot be achieved with an odd count).
4. If `n` is even, it constructs a string `s` using the pattern "110" repeated `n // 2` times. This pattern ensures that every character (except the first and last) is a special character because each middle character has exactly one different neighbor.
5. The constructed string `s` is checked to ensure its length is at most 200. If it is, the program prints "YES" followed by the string `s`. If the length exceeds 200, it prints "NO".
6. The provided logic and construction of the string `s` ensure that the constraints and requirements of the problem are met.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct according to the problem statement and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
