Reasoning:
- The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking if `n` is odd or even.
- If `n` is odd, it correctly prints 'NO' because an odd number of special characters cannot be formed as per the problem constraints.
- If `n` is even, it constructs a string `s` using the pattern '110' repeated `n//2` times. This string is intended to have exactly `n` special characters.
- However, the program does not properly check if the constructed string `s` meets the requirement of having exactly `n` special characters. Instead, it only checks the length of `s` against 200, which is not relevant to the problem constraints.
- The pattern '110' used to construct `s` will indeed create a string with `n` special characters when `n` is even, but the program fails to verify this.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as specified.

Correctness: **False**
