Output State: **`rank` is the rank part of `card`; `suit` is the suit part of `card`.**

This code unpacks the tuple `card` into two variables, `rank` and `suit`. After executing this line, `rank` will hold the rank part of `card`, and `suit` will hold the suit part of `card`. All other information from the initial state remains unchanged.
