The loop condition is `trumps != []`, which means the loop will continue as long as the list `trumps` is not empty. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is that `trumps` is sorted and must not be empty.

For the loop to execute one more time, `trumps` must still be non-empty. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary because the condition is already satisfied.

State: **`trumps` is sorted and must not be empty**
