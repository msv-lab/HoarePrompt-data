Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 16), and a trump suit ("CDHS"). Additionally, it processes a list of 2n unique cards, each represented by a two-character string. The function may return None in some cases but does not consistently return a value across all cases.**
