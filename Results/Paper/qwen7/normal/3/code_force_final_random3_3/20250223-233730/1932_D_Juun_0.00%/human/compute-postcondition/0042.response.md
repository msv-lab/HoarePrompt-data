Output State: **`trumps` is a list of ranks, `suits` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is a suit and the value is either `None` or a rank, `answers` is a list of valid card pairs, and we continue the loop or statement we were inside.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables and the loop or statement continues, the values of `trumps`, `suits`, and `answers` remain unchanged.
