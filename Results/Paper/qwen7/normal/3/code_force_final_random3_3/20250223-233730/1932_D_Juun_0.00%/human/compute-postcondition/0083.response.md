Output State: **`trumps` is an empty list.**

Natural Language Explanation: Since the loop continues to pop elements from `trumps` until it is empty, and given that the loop condition `trumps != []` ensures that the loop runs as long as `trumps` contains elements, once all elements are popped, the condition fails, and the loop terminates. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `trumps` will be an empty list.
