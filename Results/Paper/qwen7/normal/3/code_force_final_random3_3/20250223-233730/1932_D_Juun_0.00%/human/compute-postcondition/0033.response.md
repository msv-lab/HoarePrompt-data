Output State: **`rank` is the rank part of the new card, `suit` is the suit part of the new card, `trump` remains the suit part of the next card, `trumps` is the list with the new `rank` appended to it, `suits[suit]` is now equal to the new `rank`, `answers` is a list containing one string which is the sorted concatenation of `rank` and `rank` joined by a space.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `suits[suit]` to be equal to `rank`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
