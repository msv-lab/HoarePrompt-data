The function `func_1` accepts no parameters directly. However, it seems to process input data through its body, which includes:
- An integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- For each test case, an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16.
- A trump suit which is one of "CDHS".
- A list of 2n unique cards, where each card is represented by a two-character string with the first character being the rank ("23456789") and the second character being the suit ("CDHS").

The function has three possible outcomes:
- It returns None.
- It does not return any value.
- It returns None.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to process input data consisting of `t`, `n`, a trump suit, and a list of cards, and either return None or not return any value.
