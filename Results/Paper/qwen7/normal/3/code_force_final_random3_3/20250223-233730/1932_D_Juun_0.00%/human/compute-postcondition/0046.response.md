Output State: **`trumps` is a list with one less element than before, `suits` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair where the key is a suit and the value is either `None` or a rank, `answers` is a list of valid card pairs with one additional element, which is a string formatted as '{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}'.**

Explanation:
- `trumps.pop()` removes and returns the last element from the `trumps` list. This means `trumps` now has one less element.
- A new element is added to the `answers` list, which is a string formatted as `{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}`. Here, `{rank}` and `{suit}` are elements from the `suits` dictionary, and `{trumps.pop()}` and `{trump}` are the last elements from the `trumps` list before it was popped.
