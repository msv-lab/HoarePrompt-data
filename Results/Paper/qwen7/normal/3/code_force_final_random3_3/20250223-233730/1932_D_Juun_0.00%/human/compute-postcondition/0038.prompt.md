Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is a string input by the user, trumps is an empty list, `answers` is an empty list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values all set to None.
Code of the loop:
for card in input().split():
    rank, suit = card
    if suit == trump:
        trumps.append(rank)
    elif suits[suit] is not None:
        answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit],
            rank])]))
        suits[suit] = None
    else:
        suits[suit] = rank


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `rank` is the rank part of `card`; `suit` is the suit part of `card`; `trump` is the suit part of `card`. If `suit` is equal to `trump`, then `trumps` is a list with the value of `rank` appended to it. Otherwise, `suits[suit]` is updated such that if `suits[suit]` is `None`, it becomes a list containing a string formed by joining the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with `suit` in between. If `suits[suit]` is not `None`, it remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `rank` is the rank part of the next card; `suit` is the suit part of the next card; `trump` remains the suit part of the next card; `trumps` is the list with the `rank` appended to it; either `suits[suit]` is set to `None` or `suits[suit]` is now equal to `rank`; `answers` is a list containing one string which is the sorted concatenation of `suits[suit]` and `rank` joined by a space.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `rank` is the rank part of the new card, `suit` is the suit part of the new card, `trump` remains the suit part of the next card, `trumps` is the list with the new `rank` appended to it, `suits[suit]` is either the new `rank` or `None`, and `answers` is a list containing either one or two strings which are the sorted concatenations of `rank` and `rank` joined by a space and/or `suit` and `suit` joined by a space.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
