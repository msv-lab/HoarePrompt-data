Output State: **`rank` is the rank part of the next `card`; `suit` is the suit part of the next `card`; `trump` remains the suit part of the next `card`; `trumps` is the list with the values appended as per the previous iterations; `suits[suit]` is now equal to `rank`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `suits[suit]` to be equal to `rank`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
