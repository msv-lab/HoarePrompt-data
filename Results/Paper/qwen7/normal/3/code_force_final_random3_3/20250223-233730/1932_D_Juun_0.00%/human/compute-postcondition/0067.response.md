Output State: **All ranks of cards that matched the trump suit are stored in the `trumps` list. The `suits` dictionary maps each suit ('C', 'D', 'H', 'S') to either `None` (if no further cards of that suit were encountered) or the highest rank of the cards that had that suit but did not match the trump suit. The `answers` list contains all valid pairs of cards that were found to have the same suit, sorted and joined by a space, with each pair consisting of the higher rank followed by the lower rank for each non-trump suit.**

In this final state:
- `trumps` holds all the ranks of cards that had the same suit as the trump suit.
- `suits` maps each suit to either `None` (if no further cards of that suit were encountered) or the highest rank of the cards that had that suit but did not match the trump suit.
- `answers` contains all valid pairs of cards from the same non-trump suit, sorted and joined by a space, with each pair consisting of the higher rank followed by the lower rank.
