Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is a string input by the user, and we read an input which is stored but not assigned to any variable.**

The code `trump = input()` assigns the input value to the variable `trump`. Since the input is stored but not assigned to any variable, the input itself is not directly accessible or updated in the state. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the trump suit is updated to the string input by the user.
