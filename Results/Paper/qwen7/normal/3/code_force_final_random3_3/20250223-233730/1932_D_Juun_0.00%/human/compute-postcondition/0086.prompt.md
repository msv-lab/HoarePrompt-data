You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, and the trump suit is one of "CDHS". The third line of each test case contains a list of 2n unique cards, where each card is represented by a two-character string with the first character being the rank ("23456789") and the second character being the suit ("CDHS").
def func_1():
    input()
    trump = input()
    trumps = []
    answers = []
    suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}
    for card in input().split():
        rank, suit = card
        
        if suit == trump:
            trumps.append(rank)
        elif suits[suit] is not None:
            answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))
            suits[suit] = None
        else:
            suits[suit] = rank
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning all cards have been processed. Here's what the final state will look like:
    #
    #- `trumps`: This list contains all the ranks of cards that had the same suit as the trump suit.
    #- `suits`: This dictionary will have each suit ('C', 'D', 'H', 'S') mapped to either `None` (if no further cards of that suit were encountered) or the highest rank of the cards that had that suit but did not match the trump suit.
    #- `answers`: This list contains all the valid pairs of cards that were found to have the same suit, sorted and joined by a space. Each pair consists of the higher rank followed by the lower rank for each suit that was not the trump suit.
    #
    #In summary, `trumps` will hold all ranks of cards that matched the trump suit, `suits` will indicate the highest rank for each non-trump suit, and `answers` will contain all valid pairs of cards from the same non-trump suit.
    for (suit, rank) in suits.items():
        if rank is None:
            continue
        
        if trumps != []:
            answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        else:
            print('IMPOSSIBLE')
            return
        
    #State: All ranks of cards that matched the trump suit are stored in the `trumps` list. The `suits` dictionary maps each suit ('C', 'D', 'H', 'S') to either `None` (if no further cards of that suit were encountered) or the highest rank of the cards that had that suit but did not match the trump suit. The `answers` list contains all valid pairs of cards that were found to have the same suit, sorted and joined by a space, with each pair consisting of the higher rank followed by the lower rank for each non-trump suit.
    trumps = sorted(trumps)
    while trumps != []:
        print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        
    #State: Output State: `trumps` is an empty list.
    #
    #Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `trumps` will be an empty list because the loop continues to remove (pop) elements from `trumps` until it is empty. Given that the loop condition `trumps != []` ensures that the loop runs as long as `trumps` is not empty, once all elements are popped, the condition fails, and the loop terminates with `trumps` being empty.
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)
        
    #State: `trumps` is an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 16), and a trump suit ("CDHS"). Additionally, it processes a list of 2n unique cards, each represented by a two-character string. The function may return None in some cases but does not consistently return a value across all cases.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns None

Case_2: The program does not return any value

Case_3: The program returns None


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
