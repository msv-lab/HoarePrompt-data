Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it correctly identifies the trump suit and splits the input into trumps and non-trump cards.
3. It forms valid pairs of cards from the same non-trump suit, ensuring that the second card in each pair beats the first according to the rules.
4. It handles the trump cards appropriately, allowing a trump card to beat any non-trump card and being able to form valid pairs if needed.
5. The program correctly handles the case where no valid pairs can be formed and prints "IMPOSSIBLE".
6. The overall logic and flow of the program align with the problem statement and the provided examples.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
