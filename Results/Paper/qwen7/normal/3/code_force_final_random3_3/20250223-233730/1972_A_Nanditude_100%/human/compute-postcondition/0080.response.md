Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is a value within the range [0, n].
- `j` is a value within the range [0, n - 1].
- `cnt` is equal to the number of times `b[j]` was found to be less than `a[i]` during the loop's execution.
- `b` is a list of integers obtained from input.

The `print(cnt)` statement will print the value of `cnt`, which is the total count of elements in the list `b` that are less than the current value of `a[i]`.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the number of times b[j] was found to be less than a[i] during the loop's execution)**
