Output State: **`j` is equal to `n + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `cnt` is the count of elements in list `b` that are less than the element `a[i]`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a list of integers input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input and converts them into a list of integers. This list is assigned to the variable `b`. The other variables (`j`, `n`, `cnt`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
