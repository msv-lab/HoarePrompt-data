Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is between 1 and `n-1`, `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a list of integers input by the user**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` changes from 1 to 2. The values of `j`, `cnt`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
