Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `b`. The initial state of `t` and `n` remains unchanged. The value of `a` is updated to the new list `b`.
