Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not ensure that after each insertion of a new problem difficulty `w`, the array `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order before removing the last element. This means that the array `a` might not always be in the correct order after the insertion and removal operations, which could lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:

```
2
6
1000 1400 2000 2000 2200 2700
800 1200 1500 1800 2200 3000
```

The program will output `2`, but according to the problem description, the correct output should be `2`. However, the program does not guarantee that the array `a` will be sorted after each insertion and removal operation, which could lead to incorrect results in other cases as well.
