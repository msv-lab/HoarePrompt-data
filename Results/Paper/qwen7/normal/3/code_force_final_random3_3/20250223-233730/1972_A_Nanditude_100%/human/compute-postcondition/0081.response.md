Output State: **`i` is a value within the range [0, n], `j` is a value within the range [0, n - 1], `cnt` is equal to the total count of elements in the list `b` that are less than the current value of `a[i]` after all iterations, and `b` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be a value between 0 and `n` inclusive, `j` will be a value between 0 and `n-1` inclusive, and `cnt` will hold the total count of elements in the list `b` that are less than the current value of `a[i]` after processing all elements in list `b`. The list `b` itself remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
