Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the condition `4, n + 1`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be at least 5.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for values of `j` from 4 to `n` inclusive.

4. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 4 and increments by 1 each iteration, the loop will continue as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` would have been `n` (since the loop stops when `j` equals `n`).
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be `n + 1`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `n` remains the same since it is not modified within the loop.
   - `j` needs to be `n + 1` for the loop to execute one more time.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`n` must be at least 5, `j` is `n + 1`**
