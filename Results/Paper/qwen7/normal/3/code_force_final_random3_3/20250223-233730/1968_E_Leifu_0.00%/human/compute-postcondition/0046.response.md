Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop is defined as `for j in range(4, n + 1):`. The only variable in the loop head is `j`.

2. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: `n` must be greater than 3.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 4 and increments by 1 each iteration, let's assume `j` was incremented in the previous iteration (if it was not, `j` would still be 4).
   - Therefore, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 5 (assuming it was incremented once) and `n` must still be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `j` will be incremented to 6 for the next iteration.
   - `n` must still be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

So, the updated state for the next iteration is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `j` is 6**
