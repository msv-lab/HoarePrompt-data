### Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Handling**: The function `func()` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.
2. **First Two Points**: For each test case, the function prints the coordinates `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`, which are always part of the solution. This is correct.
3. **Special Case for n=3**: When `n` is 3, the function correctly adds the point `(2, 3)`. This is a valid configuration that maximizes the Manhattan distances. This is correct.
4. **General Case for n > 3**: For `n > 3`, the function prints additional points. Specifically, it prints `(2, 4)` followed by points `(j, j)` for `j` from 4 to `n`. However, this approach does not always maximize the Manhattan distances for all values of `n`.

Let's re-evaluate the general case for `n > 3`:

- **n = 4**: The given solution prints `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, and `(4, 4)`. The Manhattan distances include:
  - Between `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`: \( |1-1| + |1-2| = 1 \)
  - Between `(1, 1)` and `(2, 4)`: \( |1-2| + |1-4| = 4 \)
  - Between `(1, 1)` and `(4, 4)`: \( |1-4| + |1-4| = 6 \)
  - Between `(1, 2)` and `(2, 4)`: \( |1-2| + |2-4| = 3 \)
  - Between `(1, 2)` and `(4, 4)`: \( |1-4| + |2-4| = 5 \)
  - Between `(2, 4)` and `(4, 4)`: \( |2-4| + |4-4| = 2 \)
  The set of distances is \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\), which has a size of 6. This is the maximum possible size for \(n = 4\).

- **n = 5**: The given solution prints `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, and `(5, 5)`. The Manhattan distances include:
  - Between `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`: \( |1-1| + |1-2| = 1 \)
  - Between `(1, 1)` and `(2, 4)`: \( |1-2| + |1-4| = 4 \)
  - Between `(1, 1)` and `(5, 5)`: \( |1-5| + |1-5| = 8 \)
  - Between `(1, 2)` and `(2, 4)`: \( |1-2| + |2-4| = 3 \)
  - Between `(1, 2)` and `(5, 5)`: \( |1-5| + |2-5| = 7 \)
  - Between `(2, 4)` and `(5, 5)`: \( |2-5| + |4-5| = 4 \)
  The set of distances is \(\{1, 3, 4, 7, 8\}\), which has a size of 5. This is not the maximum possible size for \(n = 5\).

However, the original assessment is incorrect in stating that the function does not always produce the maximum possible set of Manhattan distances for all values of \(n\). Let's consider another configuration for \(n = 5\):

- **Alternative Configuration for n = 5**: Consider the points `(1, 1)`, `(1, 3)`, `(3, 1)`, `(3, 5)`, and `(5, 3)`. The Manhattan distances are:
  - Between `(1, 1)` and `(1, 3)`: \( |1-1| + |1-3| = 2 \)
  - Between `(1, 1)` and `(3, 1)`: \( |1-3| + |1-1| = 2 \)
  - Between `(1, 1)` and `(3, 5)`: \( |1-3| + |1-5| = 4 \)
  - Between `(1, 1)` and `(5, 3)`: \( |1-5| + |1-3| = 6 \)
  - Between `(1, 3)` and `(3, 1)`: \( |1-3| + |3-1| = 4 \)
  - Between `(1, 3)` and `(3, 5)`: \( |1-3| + |3-5| = 2 \)
  - Between `(1, 3)` and `(5, 3)`: \( |1-5| + |3-3| = 4 \)
  - Between `(3, 1)` and `(3, 5)`: \( |3-3| + |1-5| = 4 \)
  - Between `(3, 1)` and `(5, 3)`: \( |3-5| + |1-3| = 4 \)
  - Between `(3, 5)` and `(5, 3)`: \( |3-5| + |5-3| = 4 \)
  The set of distances is \(\{2, 4, 6\}\), which has a size of 3. This is not the maximum possible size for \(n = 5\).

Upon further review, the original assessment is correct in stating that the function does not always produce the maximum possible set of Manhattan distances for all values of \(n\). The provided configurations do not always achieve the maximum possible size of the set of distances.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
