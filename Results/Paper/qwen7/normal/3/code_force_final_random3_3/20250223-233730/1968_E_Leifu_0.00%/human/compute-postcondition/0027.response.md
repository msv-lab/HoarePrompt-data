Based on the initial state provided, `n` must be at least 4. However, the code snippet does not define or initialize any variable named `j`. Since `j` is not defined, it cannot be determined what value `j` holds. Therefore, the print statement will include two instances of `j` without any specific value assigned to it.

Output: **j j**
