Output State: `n` must be greater than or equal to 10, `j` is 11.

In natural language: After all the iterations of the loop, `n` must be at least 10 because the loop starts from 4 and increments `j` by 1 each time it runs. The loop will continue until `j` exceeds `n`, so if it has run three more times after the third iteration (making it a total of six iterations), `j` would be 11. Therefore, `n` must be at least 10 for the loop to complete all its iterations.
