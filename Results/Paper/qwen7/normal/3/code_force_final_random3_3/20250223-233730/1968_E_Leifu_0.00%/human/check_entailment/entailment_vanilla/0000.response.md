Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Handling**: The function `func()` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **First Two Points**: For each test case, the function prints the coordinates `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`, which are always part of the solution.
3. **Special Case for n=3**: When `n` is 3, the function correctly adds the point `(2, 3)`. This is a valid configuration that maximizes the Manhattan distances.
4. **General Case for n > 3**: For `n > 3`, the function prints additional points. Specifically, it prints `(2, 4)` followed by points `(j, j)` for `j` from 4 to `n`. However, this approach does not always maximize the Manhattan distances for all values of `n`.

To verify correctness, let's consider some specific test cases:

- **n = 3**: The given solution prints `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, and `(2, 3)`. The Manhattan distances are:
  - Between `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`: \( |1-1| + |1-2| = 1 \)
  - Between `(1, 1)` and `(2, 3)`: \( |1-2| + |1-3| = 3 \)
  - Between `(1, 2)` and `(2, 3)`: \( |1-2| + |2-3| = 2 \)
  Thus, the set of distances is \(\{1, 2, 3\}\), which has a size of 3. This is indeed the maximum possible size for \(n = 3\).

- **n = 4**: The given solution prints `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, and `(4, 4)`. The Manhattan distances include:
  - Between `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`: \( |1-1| + |1-2| = 1 \)
  - Between `(1, 1)` and `(2, 4)`: \( |1-2| + |1-4| = 4 \)
  - Between `(1, 1)` and `(4, 4)`: \( |1-4| + |1-4| = 6 \)
  - Between `(1, 2)` and `(2, 4)`: \( |1-2| + |2-4| = 3 \)
  - Between `(1, 2)` and `(4, 4)`: \( |1-4| + |2-4| = 5 \)
  - Between `(2, 4)` and `(4, 4)`: \( |2-4| + |4-4| = 2 \)
  The set of distances is \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\), which has a size of 6. This is the maximum possible size for \(n = 4\).

- **n = 5**: The given solution prints `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, and `(5, 5)`. The Manhattan distances include:
  - Between `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`: \( |1-1| + |1-2| = 1 \)
  - Between `(1, 1)` and `(2, 4)`: \( |1-2| + |1-4| = 4 \)
  - Between `(1, 1)` and `(5, 5)`: \( |1-5| + |1-5| = 8 \)
  - Between `(1, 2)` and `(2, 4)`: \( |1-2| + |2-4| = 3 \)
  - Between `(1, 2)` and `(5, 5)`: \( |1-5| + |2-5| = 7 \)
  - Between `(2, 4)` and `(5, 5)`: \( |2-5| + |4-5| = 4 \)
  The set of distances is \(\{1, 3, 4, 7, 8\}\), which has a size of 5. This is not the maximum possible size for \(n = 5\).

Given the above analysis, the function does not always produce the maximum possible set of Manhattan distances for all values of \(n\). Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
