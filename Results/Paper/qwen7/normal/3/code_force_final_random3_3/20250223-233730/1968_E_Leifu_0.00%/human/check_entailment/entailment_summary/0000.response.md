Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze how it handles different values of \( n \) and compare the results with the examples provided in the problem statement.

1. **For \( n = 2 \):**
   - The program prints:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     ```
   - The Manhattan distances are:
     - Distance between (1,1) and (1,2) is \( |1-1| + |1-2| = 1 \).
   - The set of distances is \(\{1\}\), so the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 1.
   - This matches the example given, but we need to check if a larger set of distances can be achieved.

2. **For \( n = 3 \):**
   - The program prints:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     2 3
     ```
   - The Manhattan distances are:
     - Distance between (1,1) and (1,2) is \( |1-1| + |1-2| = 1 \).
     - Distance between (1,1) and (2,3) is \( |1-2| + |1-3| = 2 \).
     - Distance between (1,2) and (2,3) is \( |1-2| + |2-3| = 2 \).
   - The set of distances is \(\{1, 2\}\), so the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 2.
   - This matches the example given, but we need to check if a larger set of distances can be achieved.

3. **For \( n > 3 \):**
   - The program prints:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     2 4
     4 4
     5 5
     ...
     ```
   - For \( n = 4 \):
     - The program prints:
       ```
       1 1
       1 2
       2 4
       4 4
       ```
     - The Manhattan distances are:
       - Distance between (1,1) and (1,2) is \( |1-1| + |1-2| = 1 \).
       - Distance between (1,1) and (2,4) is \( |1-2| + |1-4| = 3 \).
       - Distance between (1,2) and (2,4) is \( |1-2| + |2-4| = 3 \).
       - Distance between (2,4) and (4,4) is \( |2-4| + |4-4| = 2 \).
     - The set of distances is \(\{1, 2, 3\}\), so the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 3.
   - For \( n = 5 \):
     - The program prints:
       ```
       1 1
       1 2
       2 4
       4 4
       5 5
       ```
     - The Manhattan distances are:
       - Distance between (1,1) and (1,2) is \( |1-1| + |1-2| = 1 \).
       - Distance between (1,1) and (2,4) is \( |1-2| + |1-4| = 3 \).
       - Distance between (1,1) and (5,5) is \( |1-5| + |1-5| = 8 \).
       - Distance between (1,2) and (2,4) is \( |1-2| + |2-4| = 3 \).
       - Distance between (1,2) and (5,5) is \( |1-5| + |2-5| = 7 \).
       - Distance between (2,4) and (5,5) is \( |2-5| + |4-5| = 4 \).
     - The set of distances is \(\{1, 3, 4, 7, 8\}\), so the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 5.
   - For \( n = 6 \):
     - The program prints:
       ```
       1 1
       1 2
       2 4
       4 4
       5 5
       6 6
       ```
     - The Manhattan distances are:
       - Distance between (1,1) and (1,2) is \( |1-1| + |1-2| = 1 \).
       - Distance between (1,1) and (2,4) is \( |1-2| + |1-4| = 3 \).
       - Distance between (1,1) and (6,6) is \( |1-6| + |1-6| = 10 \).
       - Distance between (1,2) and (2,4) is \( |1-2| + |2-4| = 3 \).
       - Distance between (1,2) and (6,6) is \( |1-6| + |2-6| = 9 \).
       - Distance between (2,4) and (6,6) is \( |2-6| + |4-6| = 4 \).
     - The set of distances is \(\{1, 3, 4, 9, 10\}\), so the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 5.

Given these observations, the program correctly maximizes the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for the provided examples. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
