Output State: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4 and not equal to 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 10.

Explanation: The loop runs from `j = 4` to `j = n`. After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `j` will be `n + 1`, because the loop increments `j` from 4 up to but not including `n + 1`. Given that the loop executes all iterations, `j` will reach `n + 1 - 1 = n`, which is 10 if we consider the initial state where `n` is at least 4 and the maximum value `n` can take based on the initial conditions provided (since `t` is bounded by 50 and `n` must be such that `j` does not exceed 50). However, since the exact value of `n` is not specified beyond it being at least 4 and not 3, the most precise statement is that `j` is `n`, which is 10 in the context of the given iterations.
