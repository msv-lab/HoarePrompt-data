Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, inclusive; `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3, inclusive**.

The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the input to `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 50`, the value of `t` remains within this range after the assignment. Similarly, the initial state for `n` is not affected by this code snippet, so `n` is still an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3`.
