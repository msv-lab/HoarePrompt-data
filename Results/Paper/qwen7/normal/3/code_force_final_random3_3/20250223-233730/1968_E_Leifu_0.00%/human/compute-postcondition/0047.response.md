Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than 3 (though the value of `n` itself is not relevant to the print statement).
- `j` is explicitly stated to be 6.

The print statement is:
```python
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

This statement concatenates the string representation of `j` with a space and then again with the string representation of `j`. Since `j` is 6, the output will be "6 6".

Output: **6 6**
