Reasoning:
1. The program is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case involves placing \( n \) cells in an \( n \times n \) grid to maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances.
2. The program iterates over each test case using a loop controlled by the variable `t`.
3. For each test case, the program initializes two cells at positions `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`.
4. If `n` is exactly 3, it adds one more cell at position `(2, 3)`. Otherwise, it adds cells at positions `(2, 4)` and then continues adding cells along the diagonal starting from `(4, 4)` up to `(n, n)`.

However, the program does not correctly handle the general case for \( n > 3 \). Specifically, it only adds cells along the first row and the first column plus the diagonal starting from `(4, 4)`, which does not necessarily maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances for larger values of \( n \).

For example, for \( n = 4 \), the program outputs:
```
1 1
1 2
2 4
4 4
4 5
```
This does not cover all possible distinct Manhattan distances for \( n = 4 \). A better approach would be to place cells in a way that maximizes the variety of distances, such as placing cells in a checkerboard pattern or other strategic placements.

Given the problem constraints and the need to maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances, the provided solution is incomplete and does not guarantee the maximum number of distinct distances for all \( n \geq 3 \).

Correctness: **False**
