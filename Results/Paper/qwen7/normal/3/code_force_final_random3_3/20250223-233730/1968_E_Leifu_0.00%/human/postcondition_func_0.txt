The function processes a series of test cases defined by the integer `t`. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`. It then prints a sequence of pairs of integers. Specifically, it always prints '1 1' and '1 2'. If `n` is 3, it prints '2 3'; otherwise, it prints '2 4' followed by pairs of integers from 4 to `n`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.
