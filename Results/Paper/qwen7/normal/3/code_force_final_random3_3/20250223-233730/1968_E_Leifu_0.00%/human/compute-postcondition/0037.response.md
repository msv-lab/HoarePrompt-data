Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < t`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` remains 1, and `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50.

3. **Update the state**:
   - Since `i` remains 1, it does not change.
   - For the loop to continue, `t` must be greater than 1 (since `i` is currently 1).

Given these points, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 1 and still within the range of 0 to 50 (inclusive).

Therefore, the updated state should reflect that `t` is now greater than 1, while `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

**Final State:**
State: **`t` must be greater than 1 and less than or equal to 50, `n` must be at least 9, `i` remains 1, and `j` is equal to `n`**
