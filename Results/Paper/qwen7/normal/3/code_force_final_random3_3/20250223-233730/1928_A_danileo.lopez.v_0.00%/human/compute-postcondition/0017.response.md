Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t)`. The only variable directly involved in the loop condition is `t`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `a` and `b` are integers from input.
   - If either `a` or `b` is even, no changes are made to `t`.

4. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `t` is greater than 0, we need to ensure that `t` remains greater than 0 for the next iteration.
   - The values of `a` and `b` do not affect the loop continuation condition directly, but they might change within the loop body. However, since the problem specifies that if either `a` or `b` is even, no changes are made to `t`, we don't need to adjust `t` based on these conditions.

5. **Conclusion**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0. The values of `a` and `b` do not need to be adjusted because their evenness does not affect the loop continuation condition.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input**
