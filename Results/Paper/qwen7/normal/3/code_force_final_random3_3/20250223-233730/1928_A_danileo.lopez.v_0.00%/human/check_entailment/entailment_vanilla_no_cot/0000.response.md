Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly determines whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Test Cases Analysis**:
   - For each test case, the program checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even.
   - If either dimension is even, it prints "Yes" indicating that Bob can obtain another rectangle.
   - If both dimensions are odd, it prints "No" indicating that Bob cannot obtain another rectangle.

2. **Logic Verification**:
   - If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with at least one even side, allowing him to rearrange them into a new rectangle.
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, the only possible cuts result in smaller odd-sided rectangles, which cannot be rearranged into a different rectangle without a change in the total area.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles all edge cases correctly, including when \(a\) and \(b\) are equal and both are odd (like in the 2x2 case).

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the function, the program is correct and will produce the expected results for all valid inputs.
