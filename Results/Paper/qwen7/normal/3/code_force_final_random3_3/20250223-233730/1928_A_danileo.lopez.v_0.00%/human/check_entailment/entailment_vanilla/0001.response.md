### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - Bob starts with a rectangle of dimensions \(a \times b\).
   - He cuts this rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides.
   - He then checks if he can rearrange these two smaller rectangles to form a new rectangle that is different from the original.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle.
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, no matter how Bob cuts the rectangle, the resulting smaller rectangles will still have odd dimensions, and thus cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\).
   - It checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even using the condition `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints 'Yes'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in the program correctly identifies whether Bob can form a new rectangle:
     - If either dimension is even, the program correctly prints 'Yes' because Bob can always cut and rearrange the pieces.
     - If both dimensions are odd, the program correctly prints 'No' because no rearrangement can produce a new rectangle.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
