Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the dimensions `a` and `b` of the rectangle.
3. The program checks if either `a` or `b` is even. If at least one of them is even, it prints 'Yes', indicating that another rectangle can be formed.
4. If both `a` and `b` are odd, it prints 'No', indicating that no other rectangle can be formed.
5. The logic is sound because:
   - If either dimension is even, cutting the rectangle along that dimension will result in two smaller rectangles with at least one even dimension, allowing for the formation of another rectangle.
   - If both dimensions are odd, cutting along either dimension will result in two smaller rectangles with both odd dimensions, and further cutting will not produce a new unique rectangle (since any resulting rectangle will still have both dimensions odd).

Given the problem statement and the provided examples, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can form another rectangle.

Correctness: **True**
