### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Bob starts with a rectangle of dimensions \(a \times b\).
   - He cuts this rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides.
   - He then checks if he can rearrange these two smaller rectangles to form a new rectangle that is different from the original.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle.
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, no matter how Bob cuts the rectangle, the resulting smaller rectangles will still have odd dimensions, and thus cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\).
   - It checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even using the condition `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints 'Yes'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in the program correctly identifies whether Bob can form a new rectangle:
     - If either dimension is even, the program correctly prints 'Yes' because Bob can always cut and rearrange the pieces.
     - If both dimensions are odd, the program correctly prints 'No' because no rearrangement can produce a new rectangle.

However, there is a subtle issue with the program's logic. The program checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, but it does not account for the fact that the resulting rectangles after cutting must also be able to form a new rectangle. Specifically, if both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, the program correctly prints 'No', but it does not consider the possibility of forming a new rectangle when one dimension is even and the other is odd.

For example, consider the test case where \(a = 3\) and \(b = 4\):
- The program would print 'Yes' because \(b\) is even.
- However, the resulting rectangles would be \(3 \times 2\) and \(3 \times 2\), which cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle.

Therefore, the program's logic is incomplete and does not fully capture the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the program does not correctly handle the case where one dimension is even and the other is odd. The program should check if the product of the dimensions is even, as this ensures that at least one of the resulting rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
