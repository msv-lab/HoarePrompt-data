Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `a` is an integer from input.
- `b` is an integer from input.
- `a` and `b` are updated to integers from input (though their specific values after updating are not relevant to the print statement).

The print statement simply outputs the string `'Yes'`.

Output: **Yes**
