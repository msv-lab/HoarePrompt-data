Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input, `a` and `b` are assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated inputs from the user, converts them to integers, and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged, and the values of `a` and `b` are updated to the integers provided by the user.
