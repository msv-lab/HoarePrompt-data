Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t)`. The variables involved here are `t`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `a` is an integer from input.
   - `b` is an integer from input.
   - If either `a` or `b` is even, then `a` remains unchanged and `b` remains unchanged.
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd, then `a` remains unchanged and `b` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is controlled by `t`, and `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, we need to decrement `t` by 1 for the next iteration.
   - The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged based on the given conditions.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `t` is decremented by 1 (so if it was `t` before, now it is `t - 1`).
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `b` remains unchanged.

Given that `t` must be greater than 0 initially, after decrementing by 1, `t` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

**Final State**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from input, and `b` is an integer from input. If either `a` or `b` is even, then `a` remains unchanged and `b` remains unchanged. If both `a` and `b` are odd, then `a` remains unchanged and `b` remains unchanged.**
