Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input**.

Explanation: The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated inputs from the user and converts them into integers. These integers are then assigned to the variables `a` and `b`. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
