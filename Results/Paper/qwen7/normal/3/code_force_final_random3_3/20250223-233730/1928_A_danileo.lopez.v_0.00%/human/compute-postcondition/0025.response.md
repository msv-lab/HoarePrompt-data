Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers: t, a, and b. It checks if t is within the range 1 to 10^4 and both a and b are within the range 1 to 10^9. If a or b is even, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. After processing all test cases, t will be 0, and the final values of a and b will be the last integers entered during the final iteration of the loop.**
