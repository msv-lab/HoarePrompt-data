Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates `t` times, reading pairs of integers `(a, b)` for each test case.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - For each pair `(a, b)`, the program checks if either `a` or `b` is even using the condition `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints 'Yes'.
   - If the condition is false, it prints 'No'.

3. **Problem Description Understanding:**
   - According to the problem, Bob can form another rectangle by cutting the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then rearranging them.
   - A key observation is that if either dimension of the original rectangle is even, Bob can always achieve this by cutting the rectangle along the even dimension and then rearranging the pieces to form a new rectangle.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - When both dimensions are odd (`a` and `b` are both odd), Bob cannot form another distinct rectangle because:
     - Cutting an odd-sized rectangle results in two smaller odd-sized rectangles.
     - Rearranging these smaller odd-sized rectangles cannot form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

5. **Verification:**
   - The logic in the program correctly identifies whether at least one dimension is even.
   - If at least one dimension is even, the program correctly outputs 'Yes'.
   - If both dimensions are odd, the program correctly outputs 'No'.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to determine if Bob can form another rectangle from the given dimensions. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
