Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though the value of `t` is not relevant to the print statement).
- `a` is an integer from input.
- `b` is an integer from input.
- `a` and `b` are assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers.

The print statement is:
```python
print('Yes')
```

This print statement will simply output the string 'Yes', regardless of the values of `a` and `b`.

Output: **Yes**
