Output State: **`t` is 1, `u` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u ≤ n, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory list, `i` is 0, `nodes[u]` includes `v`.**

Explanation: The line `nodes[u].append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list associated with the key `u` in the `defaultdict` named `nodes`. The values of `t`, `u`, `v`, `n`, `empty`, and `i` remain unchanged. The `nodes` dictionary now contains an entry for `u` with a list that includes `v`.
