Output State: **`tree` list includes the node `e`; `prev` holds the last node that was visited before `e`; `curr` is equal to `e`; `start` is an input integer; `idx` is the index of `start` in the `tree` list.**

Explanation: The code `idx = tree.index(start)` finds the index of the `start` element within the `tree` list and assigns it to the variable `idx`. The values of the other variables (`tree`, `prev`, `curr`, and `start`) remain unchanged.
