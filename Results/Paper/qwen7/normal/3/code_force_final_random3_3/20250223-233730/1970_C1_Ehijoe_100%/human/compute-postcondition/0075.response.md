Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies a context where variables n, t, u, v, and a list of starting nodes (u_1) are defined with specific constraints. It returns a value based on these inputs.**

Given the constraints:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `t` is an integer such that \(t = 1\).
- `u` and `v` are integers such that \(1 \leq u, v \leq n\).
- The list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer such that \(1 \leq u_1 \leq n\).

The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, it operates within a context where these variables are predefined. The function's output is based on these predefined variables and their relationships.
