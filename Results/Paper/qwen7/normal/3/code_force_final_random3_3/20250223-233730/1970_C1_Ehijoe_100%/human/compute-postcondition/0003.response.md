Output State: **`t` is 1, `u` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u ≤ n, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `empty` is True, and nodes is a defaultdict with default factory list.**

The code initializes a `defaultdict` named `nodes` with a default factory of `list`. This means that `nodes` can be treated like a dictionary where each key maps to a list. However, no specific keys or values are added to `nodes` in this snippet, so it remains an empty defaultdict of lists. All other variables retain their initial states.
