Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n - 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` is 1
   - `u` is an input integer
   - `v` is an input integer
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\)
   - `empty` is True
   - `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory list
   - `i` is 3
   - `nodes[v]` includes `u`

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 4.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop body.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `t` remains 1.
   - `u` remains an input integer.
   - `v` remains an input integer.
   - `n` remains an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
   - `empty` remains True.
   - `nodes` remains a defaultdict with default factory list.
   - `i` is updated to 4.
   - `nodes[v]` still includes `u`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is 1, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `empty` is True, `nodes` is a defaultdict with default factory list, `i` is 4, `nodes[v]` includes `u`**
