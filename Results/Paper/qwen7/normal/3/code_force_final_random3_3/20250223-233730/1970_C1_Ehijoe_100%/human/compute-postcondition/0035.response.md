Output State: **`ends` list is now empty, `s` is the first element from the `ends` list before it was emptied, `e` is the second element from the `ends` list before it was emptied, `tree` is a list containing the element `s`, and `prev` is equal to `s`.**

Explanation: The line `prev = s` assigns the value of `s` to the variable `prev`. The values of `ends`, `s`, `e`, and `tree` remain unchanged from their initial states.
