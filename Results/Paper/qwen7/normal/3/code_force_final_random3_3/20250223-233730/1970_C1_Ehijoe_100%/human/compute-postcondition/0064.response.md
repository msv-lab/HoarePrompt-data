Output State: The `tree` list will contain a path from `s` to `e` in the graph represented by `nodes`. Specifically, starting from `s`, the `tree` list will include each node visited until it reaches `e`. The `prev` variable will hold the last node that was visited before `e`, and `curr` will be equal to `e` after the loop finishes. The `tree` list will trace the path from `s` to `e` based on the structure defined by `nodes`.

In simpler terms, the `tree` list will show the sequence of nodes traversed from the start node `s` to the end node `e` following the rules specified in the `nodes` dictionary, with `prev` holding the last node before `e` and `curr` being set to `e` at the end.
