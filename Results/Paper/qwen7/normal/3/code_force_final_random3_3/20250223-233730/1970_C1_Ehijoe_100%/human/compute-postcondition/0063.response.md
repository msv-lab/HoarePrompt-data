Output State: The `tree` list will contain a path from `s` to `e` in the graph represented by `nodes`. Specifically, starting from `s`, the `tree` will be constructed by following the edges defined in `nodes` until it reaches `e`. Each iteration of the loop adds the current node (`curr`) to the `tree` list and updates `prev` and `curr` based on the conditions provided. The final state of `tree` will be a sequence of nodes representing the shortest path (in terms of the given edge structure) from `s` to `e`.

The `prev` variable will hold the previous node in the path, and `curr` will hold the current node being processed. After the loop completes, `curr` will be equal to `e`, and `prev` will be the last node before `e` in the path. The `tree` list will include all nodes visited along this path, starting from `s` and ending at `e`.
