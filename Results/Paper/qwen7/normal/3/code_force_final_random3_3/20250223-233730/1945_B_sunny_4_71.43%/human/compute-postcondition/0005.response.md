Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers.
- `A` is equal to `int(m / a) + 1`.
- `B` is equal to `int(m / b) + 1`.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(A + B)`.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Value of `A`:**
   - `A = int(m / a) + 1`
   - This means `A` is the result of integer division of `m` by `a`, followed by adding 1 to the result.

2. **Value of `B`:**
   - `B = int(m / b) + 1`
   - This means `B` is the result of integer division of `m` by `b`, followed by adding 1 to the result.

3. **Expression to be printed:**
   - The expression to be printed is `A + B`.
   - Substituting the values of `A` and `B`, we get `int(m / a) + 1 + int(m / b) + 1`.

4. **Simplifying the expression:**
   - `A + B = int(m / a) + int(m / b) + 2`

Therefore, the output will be the sum of the integer divisions of `m` by `a` and `b`, plus 2.

Output: **int(m / a) + int(m / b) + 2**
