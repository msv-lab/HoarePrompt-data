### Reasoning

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the analysis again to ensure completeness and clarity.

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which indicates the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`.

2. **Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `A` as `int(m / a) + 1`.
   - It calculates `B` as `int(m / b) + 1`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the sum `A + B` for each test case.

### Reasoning

#### Correctness of Calculation

- **Understanding the Problem**:
  - Fireworks launched by the first installation are visible every `a` minutes.
  - Fireworks launched by the second installation are visible every `b` minutes.
  - Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes.
  - We need to find the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously.

- **Calculation Explanation**:
  - `A` represents the number of times the first installation launches fireworks within the interval `[0, m]`.
  - `B` represents the number of times the second installation launches fireworks within the same interval.
  - Adding these together gives the total number of fireworks visible at any point in time.

- **Formula Analysis**:
  - `A = int(m / a) + 1` means the number of times the first installation launches fireworks within the interval `[0, m]`.
  - `B = int(m / b) + 1` means the number of times the second installation launches fireworks within the same interval.

- **Summing Up**:
  - The sum `A + B` gives the maximum number of fireworks visible at any moment because the intervals of launches are independent.

### Example Verification

Let's verify the example provided:

- **Test Case 1**: `a = 6`, `b = 7`, `m = 4`
  - `A = int(4 / 6) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`
  - `B = int(4 / 7) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`
  - `A + B = 1 + 1 = 2` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2**: `a = 3`, `b = 4`, `m = 10`
  - `A = int(10 / 3) + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4`
  - `B = int(10 / 4) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3`
  - `A + B = 4 + 3 = 7` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3**: `a = 7`, `b = 8`, `m = 56`
  - `A = int(56 / 7) + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9`
  - `B = int(56 / 8) + 1 = 7 + 1 = 8`
  - `A + B = 9 + 8 = 17` (Correct)

### Conclusion

The program correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time based on the given logic. Therefore, the program is correct.
