Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `A` is `int(m // a) + 1`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `A` as the integer division of `m` by `a`, followed by adding 1 to the result. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state.
