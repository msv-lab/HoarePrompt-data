Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the logic and the problem requirements step-by-step.

1. **Problem Requirements**: The goal is to find the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. Fireworks launched by the first installation at multiples of \(a\) minutes and by the second installation at multiples of \(b\) minutes are visible for \(m+1\) minutes. 

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads \(a\), \(b\), and \(m\).
   - It calculates \(A = \text{int}(m / a) + 1\) and \(B = \text{int}(m / b) + 1\).
   - It prints \(A + B\).

3. **Calculation of \(A\) and \(B\)**:
   - \(A\) represents the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the visibility period \(m\).
   - \(B\) represents the number of fireworks launched by the second installation within the visibility period \(m\).

4. **Sum \(A + B\)**:
   - The sum \(A + B\) gives the total number of fireworks that could be seen simultaneously because each installation launches fireworks independently and the visibility period is considered separately for each installation.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where \(m\) might be exactly divisible by \(a\) or \(b\), which is correctly accounted for by adding 1 to the integer division result.
   - The program also handles large values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(m\) up to \(10^{18}\), which is within the constraints specified.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen simultaneously in the sky. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
