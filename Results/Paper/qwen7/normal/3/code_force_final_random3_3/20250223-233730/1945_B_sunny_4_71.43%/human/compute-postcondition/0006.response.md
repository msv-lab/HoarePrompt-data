Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\).

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 from its current value. Since `t` was greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will still be greater than 0 if we decrement it by 1 (assuming `t` was initially greater than 1).

5. **Final state for the next iteration**: The new value of `t` will be `t - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\)**.

Note that `a`, `b`, `m`, `A`, and `B` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.
