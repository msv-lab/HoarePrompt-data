### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the logic and correctness of the code:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Variable Initialization**: For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`.
3. **Calculation of Fireworks Visible**:
   - `A` is calculated as `int(m / a) + 1`, which represents the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the visibility period `m`.
   - `B` is calculated as `int(m / b) + 1`, which represents the number of fireworks launched by the second installation within the visibility period `m`.
4. **Output**: The program prints the sum of `A` and `B` for each test case, which is intended to represent the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of the program. The calculation of `A` and `B` does not account for the fact that fireworks from both installations can overlap in visibility. Specifically, the formula `int(m / a) + 1` and `int(m / b) + 1` do not consider the possibility of fireworks from different installations being launched at the same time.

To correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` and then determine how many fireworks can be visible at any given time within the visibility period `m`.

### Correct Solution:
The correct approach involves finding the LCM of `a` and `b` and then determining the number of intervals of length `m + 1` that fit into the LCM period.

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        lcm_ab = (a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)
        
        # Calculate the number of intervals of length m + 1 that fit into the LCM period
        max_visible = (lcm_ab + m) // (m + 1)
        
        print(max_visible)
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect because it does not properly account for the overlapping visibility periods of fireworks from both installations. Therefore, the given program is **Incorrect**.

Correctness: **False**
