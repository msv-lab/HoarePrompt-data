Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `A` is `int(m // a) + 1`, `B` is `int(m / b) + 1`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `B` as `int(m / b) + 1`. Since `m` is already defined as an integer, the value of `B` is determined by dividing `m` by `b` and then adding 1. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `m`, and `A` remain unchanged from their initial states.
