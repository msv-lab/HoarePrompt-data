Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an input integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\).
   - `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.
   - `A` is defined as `int(m // a) + 1`.
   - `B` is defined as `int(m / b) + 1`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(A + B)
   ```

Given the definitions:
- `A = int(m // a) + 1`: This means `A` is the result of integer division of `m` by `a`, followed by adding 1 to the result.
- `B = int(m / b) + 1`: This means `B` is the result of floating-point division of `m` by `b`, followed by converting it to an integer and then adding 1 to the result.

When these two values are added together, the expression `A + B` will be evaluated and printed.

Therefore, the output will be the sum of `A` and `B`.

Output: **int(m // a) + 1 + int(m / b) + 1**
