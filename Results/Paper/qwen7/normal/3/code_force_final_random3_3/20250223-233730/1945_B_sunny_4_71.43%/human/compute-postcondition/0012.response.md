Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 0 and \(10^4 - 1\), `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `A` is `int(m // a) + 1`, `B` is `int(m / b) + 1`**.

Explanation: The code `a, b, m = map(int, input().split())` reads three space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to `a`, `b`, and `m` respectively. It does not affect the value of `t` or the expressions for `A` and `B`. Therefore, the initial conditions for `t`, `a`, `b`, `m`, `A`, and `B` remain unchanged except that `A` and `B` are now defined based on the new values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.
