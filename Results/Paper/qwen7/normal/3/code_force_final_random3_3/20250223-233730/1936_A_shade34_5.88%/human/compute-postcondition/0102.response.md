Output State: **`i` is 5, `mak` is 4, a string input has been read and its value is less than the character `<`, `n` must be greater than 5**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values or conditions. It only flushes the output buffer, ensuring that all pending output is written to the console. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
