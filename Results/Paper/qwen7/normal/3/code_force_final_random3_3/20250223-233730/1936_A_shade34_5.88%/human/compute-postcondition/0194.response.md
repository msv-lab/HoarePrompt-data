Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer, `mak` is equal to `n - 1`, and `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed `n-1` times.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < n`. After `n-1` iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`. During each iteration, the value of `mak` is updated to `i` if the input is `<`. Therefore, after `n-1` iterations, `mak` will be set to `n-1`. The `sys.stdout.flush()` function is called in each iteration, so it will be executed `n-1` times.
