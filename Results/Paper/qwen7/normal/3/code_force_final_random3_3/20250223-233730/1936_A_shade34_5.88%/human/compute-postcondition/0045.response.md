Output State: **`i` is 1, 2, or 3; `n` must be greater than 3; `s` is an input string; `pans` is a list containing the value of `i`; `s` is the new input string from the user.**

Explanation: The code `pans.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `pans`. Since `i` can be 1, 2, or 3, `pans` will contain one of these values. The other variables (`n`, `s`) remain unchanged, and `s` is updated to the new input string from the user.
