Output State: **`i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 3, `s` is the last input string received by the user, `pans` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n-2` inclusive, and `mak` is equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code `mak = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `mak`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
