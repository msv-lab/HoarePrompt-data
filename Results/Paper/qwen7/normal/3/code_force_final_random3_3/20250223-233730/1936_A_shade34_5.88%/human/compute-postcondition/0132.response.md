Postcondition: `i` is `k + 1`; `n` must be greater than `n-1`; `mak` is `n-1`; `mak2` is `n-1`; `pans` is a list containing the elements `k + 1` and `i`; the new string `s` is equal to the input received from the user. If the string `s` is equal to `'='`, then `i` remains `k + 1` and `pans` includes both `k + 1` and `i`.
