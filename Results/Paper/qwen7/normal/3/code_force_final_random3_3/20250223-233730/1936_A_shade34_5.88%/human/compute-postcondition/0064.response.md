Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 3**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change the values of any variables. It only flushes the output buffer, which is an operation related to how the program interacts with the console or file system, not with the state of the variables. Therefore, the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
