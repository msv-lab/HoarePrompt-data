Postcondition: `i` is `mak + 1`, `n` is `n-2`, `pans` is a list containing all integers from `0` to `n-1`, and `mak` is `i` if the input string is `'>'; otherwise, `i` is `mak + 1`, `n` is `n-2`, `pans` is a list containing all integers from `0` to `n-1`, and there is no change in the value of `mak`.
