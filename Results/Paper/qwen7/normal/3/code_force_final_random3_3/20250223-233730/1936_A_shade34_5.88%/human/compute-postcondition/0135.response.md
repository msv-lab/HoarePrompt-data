Postcondition: `i` is `k + 1`; `n` must be greater than `n-1`; `mak` and `mak2` are both `n-1`; `pans` is a list containing the elements `k + 1` and `i`; the new string `s` is equal to the input received from the user. If the string `s` equals `<`, then `i` becomes `k + 1`; `mak` becomes `i`; and `pans` includes `i` (which is `k + 1`). If the string `s` equals `=`, then `i` remains `k + 1`; `n` remains greater than `n-1`; `mak` and `mak2` remain `n-1`; `pans` includes `k + 1` and `i`; and `s` remains the input received from the user.
