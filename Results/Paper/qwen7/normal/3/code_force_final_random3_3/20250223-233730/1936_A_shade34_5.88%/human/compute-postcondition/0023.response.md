Output State: **`mak` is 3, `mak2` is 3, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, and the input string is not '<' for any iteration from 2 to n-1.**

Explanation: The code `mak2 = mak` simply assigns the current value of `mak` (which is 3) to `mak2`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, and the condition on the input string) remain unchanged.
