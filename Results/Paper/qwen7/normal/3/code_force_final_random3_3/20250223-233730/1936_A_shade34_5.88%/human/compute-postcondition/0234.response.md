Based on the initial state provided, `i` is less than `len(pans)`. This means that `i` is a valid index for the list `pans`.

However, the values of `mak` and the specific elements of the list `pans` are not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact values of `pans[mak]` and `pans[i]`.

Given this, the print statement will output a formatted string with placeholders for these values.

Output: **'? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]]'**
