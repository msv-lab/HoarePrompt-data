Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1, 2, or 3.
- `n` must be greater than 3.
- `s` is a string input by the user.
- `pans` is a list containing the value of `i` if `s` is '<' or '='. Otherwise, `pans` remains unchanged.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **`i`**: The value of `i` is either 1, 2, or 3.
2. **`s`**: The value of `s` is a string input by the user, but its specific value is not given.
3. **`pans`**: 
   - If `s` is '<' or '=', then `pans` will contain the value of `i`.
   - Otherwise, `pans` remains unchanged.
4. **`mak` and `mak2`**: These variables are not defined in the initial state, so their values are unknown. They might be part of a larger context or defined elsewhere in the code, but they are not provided here.

Given the lack of specific values for `mak` and `mak2`, we can only determine the value of `i` and the condition under which `pans` might change.

Therefore, the output will include the character '?', followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, and `i`, with `mak2` being the same as `mak`.

Output: **'? [mak] [mak2] [i]' (where [mak] and [mak2] are unknown values and [i] is 1, 2, or 3)**
