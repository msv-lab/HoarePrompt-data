Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `n` is an input integer, `mak` is equal to `n - 1`, and `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed `n-1` times.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i` starting at 1 up to but not including `n`. Therefore, it will run exactly `n-1` times. Each time the loop runs, `i` is incremented by 1. After `n-1` iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`. During each iteration, `mak` is set to `i` if the input is `<`. Since the loop runs `n-1` times, `mak` will be set to the last value of `i`, which is `n-1`. The `sys.stdout.flush()` function is called at the start of each iteration, so it will be executed `n-1` times.
