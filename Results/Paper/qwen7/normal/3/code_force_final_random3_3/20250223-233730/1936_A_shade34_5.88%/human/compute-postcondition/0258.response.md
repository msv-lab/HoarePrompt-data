Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and interacts with a hidden permutation \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \) which is a permutation of \(\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}\). It can ask up to \(3n\) queries of the form "? a b c d" to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements in the permutation. After determining the indices \(i\) and \(j\) that maximize \(p_i \oplus p_j\), it prints "! i j".**

This means the function does not take any explicit parameters but works with an internal permutation. It can make queries to compare bitwise ORs of different pairs and then finds and prints the pair of indices that give the maximum XOR value.
