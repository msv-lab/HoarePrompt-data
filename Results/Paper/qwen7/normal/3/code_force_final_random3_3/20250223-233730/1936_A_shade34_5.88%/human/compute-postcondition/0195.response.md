Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `mak` is equal to `n-1`, `mak2` is equal to `n-1`, and `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed `n-1` times.**

Explanation: The code `mak2 = mak` simply assigns the current value of `mak` (which is `n-1`) to `mak2`. Since `mak` was previously set to `n-1` during the loop, `mak2` now also holds the value `n-1`. All other conditions and states remain unchanged.
