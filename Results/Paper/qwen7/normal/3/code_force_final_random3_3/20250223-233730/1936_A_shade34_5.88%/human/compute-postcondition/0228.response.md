Postcondition: **`pans` is a list containing `i`, `i` is less than `n` and equal to `i + 1`, `mak` is equal to `i` or `n-1`, `mak2` is equal to `n-1`, `s` is the input string entered by the user, and `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed `n+1` times. This is because if `s` equals '=', the original state remains unchanged. Since there is no else part, the postcondition directly follows the if part.**
