Based on the initial state provided:

- `mak` is explicitly given as 1.
- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n` must be greater than 2, but this value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- The input is a string equal to '<', but this is also not needed to determine the output of the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

This will print the string `?` followed by the values of `mak` (which is 1), `mak` again (which is 1), `i` (which is 2), and `i` again (which is 2).

Output: **? 1 1 2 2**
