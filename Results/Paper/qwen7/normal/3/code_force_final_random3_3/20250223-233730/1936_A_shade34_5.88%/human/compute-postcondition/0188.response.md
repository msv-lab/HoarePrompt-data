Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive) because `range(1, n)` generates numbers from 1 up to but not including `n`.

3. **Postcondition Analysis**:
   - The postcondition states that `i` is incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`).
   - `n` is an input integer and does not change within the loop.
   - `mak` is set to `i + 1` at the start of each iteration.

4. **Input String Consideration**:
   - If the input string is `<`, the postcondition remains the same.
   - If the input string is not `<`, no change is made to the variables.

5. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, if the loop continues, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `mak` will be set to `i + 1` at the start of the next iteration.

Given that the loop condition is `i < n`, for the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.

6. **Final State Calculation**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, let's assume `i` was `k` and `n` was `m`.
   - After the increment, `i` becomes `k + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `k + 1` must be less than `m`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes.

**State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `mak` is `i + 1`**.
