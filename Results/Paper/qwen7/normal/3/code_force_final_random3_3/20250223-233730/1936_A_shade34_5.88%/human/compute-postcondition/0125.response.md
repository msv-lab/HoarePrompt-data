Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is less than `n`.
   - `n` must be greater than `n-1`.
   - `mak` is `n-1`.
   - `mak2` is `n-1`.
   - `pans` is a list containing the element `i`.
   - The new string `s` is either equal to '<' or '='.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n` at the start of the next iteration.
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration (assuming the loop body increments `i`), at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `i + 1`.
   - The condition `n > n-1` is always true, so no change is needed for `n`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so if `i` was `k` before, it will be `k+1` in the next iteration.
   - `mak` and `mak2` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.
   - `pans` remains a list containing the element `i`, but since `i` changes, `pans` will contain `i+1`.
   - `s` remains either '<' or '='.

Given these points, the updated states at the start of the next iteration are:

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `n-1`, `mak` is `n-1`, `mak2` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing the element `i + 1`, and the new string `s` is either equal to '<' or '='.**

To be more specific, if `i` was `k` before, then:

State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `n` must be greater than `n-1`, `mak` is `n-1`, `mak2` is `n-1`, `pans` is a list containing the element `k + 1`, and the new string `s` is either equal to '<' or '='.**
