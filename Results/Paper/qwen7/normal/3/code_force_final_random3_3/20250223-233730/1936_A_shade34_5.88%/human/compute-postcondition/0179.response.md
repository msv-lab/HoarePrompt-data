Output State: **`i` is equal to `mak`, `n` is an input integer, `sys.stdout.flush()` is executed, a string is read from the input and its value is less than the character '<'**.

Explanation: The line `mak = i` assigns the current value of `i` to the new variable `mak`. All other conditions and states remain unchanged.
