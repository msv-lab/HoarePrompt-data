You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

There is a secret sequence p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} , which is a permutation
of \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} .

You need to find any two indices i and j such that p_i \oplus p_j is
maximized, where \oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

To do this, you can ask queries. Each query has the following form: you pick arbitrary indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d < n ). Next, the jury calculates x = (p_a \mid p_b) and y = (p_c \mid p_d) , where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). Finally, you receive the result of comparison between x and y . In other words, you are told if x < y , x > y , or x = y .

Please find any two indices i and j (0 \le i,j < n ) such that p_i \oplus p_j
is maximum among all such pairs, using at most 3n queries. If there are
multiple pairs of indices satisfying the condition, you may output any one of
them.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The description of the test cases follows.

Interaction

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).
At this moment, the permutation p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} is chosen. The
interactor in this task is not adaptive. In other words, the sequence p is
fixed in every test case and does not change during the interaction.

To ask a query, you need to pick four indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d
< n ) and print the line of the following form:

  * "? a b c d" 

After that, you receive:

  * "<" if (p_a \mid p_b) < (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * "=" if (p_a \mid p_b) = (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * ">" if (p_a \mid p_b) > (p_c \mid p_d) . 

You can make at most 3n queries of this form.

Next, if your program has found a pair of indices i and j (0 \le i, j < n )
such that p_i \oplus p_j is maximized, print the line of the following form:

  * "! i j" 

Note that this line is not considered a query and is not taken into account
when counting the number of queries asked.

After this, proceed to the next test case.

If you make more than 3n queries during an interaction, your program must
terminate immediately, and you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.
Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will
continue to read from a closed stream.

After printing a query or the answer for a test case, do not forget to output
the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get the verdict
Idleness Limit Exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see the documentation for other languages. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4 .

Hacks

To hack, follow the test format below.

The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_0,p_1,\ldots,p_{n-1} ,
which represent a permutation of integers from 0 to n - 1 .

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .

Example

Input

    2
    4
    
    <
    
    =
    
    >
    
    2
    
Output

    ? 0 2 3 1
    
    ? 1 1 2 3
    
    ? 1 2 0 3
    
    ! 3 2
    
    ! 0 1
    
Note

In the first test case, the hidden permutation is p=[0,3,1,2] .

For the query "? 0 2 3 1", the jury return "<" because (p_0 \mid p_2) = (0
\mid 1) =1 < (p_3 \mid p_1) = (2 \mid 3) = 3 .

For the query "? 1 1 2 3", the jury return "=" because (p_1 \mid p_1) = (3\mid
3)= 3 = (p_2 \mid p_3) = (1 \mid 2)=3 .

For the query "? 1 2 0 3", the jury return ">" because (p_1 \mid p_2) = (3
\mid 1) = 3 > (p_0 \mid p_3) = (0\mid 2)=2 .

The answer i = 3 and j = 2 is valid: (p_3 \oplus p_2) = (2 \oplus 1) = 3 is
indeed equal to the maximum possible value of p_i \oplus p_j . Another valid
answer would be i=0 and j=1 . As the number of queries does not exceed 3n=12 ,
the answer is considered correct.

In the second test case, n = 2 , so p is either [0, 1] or [1, 0] . In any
case, p_0 \oplus p_1 = 1 is maximum possible.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the input variables are explicitly defined in the provided function signature. However, the problem requires interacting with a hidden permutation \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \), which is a permutation of \(\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}\). You can ask up to \(3n\) queries of the form "? a b c d" to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements in the permutation. After determining the indices \(i\) and \(j\) that maximize \(p_i \oplus p_j\), you must print "! i j".

    #State: Output State: `i` is equal to the length of `pans`, `mak` is equal to `len(pans) - 1`, `n` is 0 (as it decreases by 1 each iteration and starts as `len(pans) - 1`), `pans` is a list containing all integers from `0` to `len(pans) - 1`, and `sys.stdout.flush()` is executed.
    #
    #After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of `pans`, which is `n` (since `pans` contains all integers from `0` to `n-1`). `mak` will be equal to `len(pans) - 1`, which is `n - 1`. The variable `n` will be 0 because it starts as `len(pans) - 1` and decreases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0. `pans` will contain all integers from `0` to `n-1`, which is `0` to `n-1` or simply `0` to `len(pans) - 1`. Finally, `sys.stdout.flush()` is called to ensure the output is sent to the standard output.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the permutation `n`.

2. **Finding a Candidate for Maximum XOR:**
   - The program iterates from `1` to `n-1` to find a candidate index `mak` such that `p_mak` is potentially part of the maximum XOR pair.
   - It prints a query `? mak mak i i` to compare `(p_mak | p_mak)` with `(p_i | p_i)`.
   - If the response is `<`, it updates `mak` to `i`.

3. **Finding Additional Candidates:**
   - After finding `mak`, the program initializes `mak2` to `mak` and creates a list `pans` to store additional candidates.
   - It iterates through all indices from `0` to `n-1` to find additional candidates.
   - For each index `i`, it prints a query `? mak mak2 i mak2` to compare `(p_mak | p_mak2)` with `(p_i | p_mak2)`.
   - Based on the response, it updates `mak` and adds `i` to `pans`.

4. **Refining the Candidates:**
   - The program then refines the candidates by iterating through `pans` and comparing pairs to find the maximum XOR.
   - It prints a query `? pans[mak] pans[mak] pans[i] pans[i]` to compare `(p_mak | p_mak)` with `(p_i | p_i)`.
   - If the response is `>`, it updates `mak` to `i`.

5. **Outputting the Result:**
   - Finally, it prints the indices `mak2` and `mak` as the pair with the maximum XOR and flushes the output.

### Issues Identified

1. **Query Efficiency:**
   - The program makes a large number of queries (`3n` queries in the worst case), but it is within the allowed limit.
   - However, the logic for finding the maximum XOR pair is flawed. Specifically, the program assumes that the maximum XOR can always be found by comparing pairs of the same index, which is not necessarily true.

2. **Candidate Selection:**
   - The initial candidate selection process (`mak`) is not optimal. It only compares the same index, which might not lead to the correct maximum XOR pair.

3. **Candidate Refinement:**
   - The refinement process is also flawed. It only compares pairs of the same index, which again might not lead to the correct maximum XOR pair.

### Conclusion

Given the flaws in the logic for finding the maximum XOR pair, the provided program is not correct according to the problem description.
