Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `k + 1` and `n` must be greater than `n-1` (which means `n > k`).

3. **Determine the state adjustments needed**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `k + 2`.
   - `n` must still be greater than `k`.

4. **Consider the loop body effects**:
   - The loop body is omitted, but based on the postconditions, if the string `s` is `<`, `i` becomes `k + 1` and `mak` becomes `i`. However, since we are considering the next iteration, `i` should be incremented to `k + 2`.
   - If the string `s` is `=`, `i` remains `k + 1`, but for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented to `k + 2`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` should be `k + 2`.
   - `n` must still be greater than `k`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is `k + 2`, `n` must be greater than `k`**.
