Output State: **`i` is 1, `mak` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `mak` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1, and the condition that `n` is greater than 3 is still valid. The input being a string equal to '>' is also still valid but is not directly relevant to the variables `i` and `mak`.
