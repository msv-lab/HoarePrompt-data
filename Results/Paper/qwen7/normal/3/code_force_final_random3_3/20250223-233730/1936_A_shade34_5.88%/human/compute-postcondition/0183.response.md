Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is `i + 1`: This suggests that `i` is being assigned the value of `i + 1`. However, since `i` is not explicitly defined before this assignment, it implies that `i` is being incremented by 1 from some previous value.
   - `n` is an input integer: This means `n` is an integer provided as input.
   - `sys.stdout.flush()` is executed: This ensures that any buffered output is immediately sent to the standard output.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
   ```

Given the initial state, let's analyze the print statement:

- `'?'`: This is a literal string that will be printed as is.
- `mak`: The variable `mak` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its value.
- `i`: As mentioned, `i` is `i + 1` from some previous value. Since no specific value for `i` is provided, we can only say that `i` is one more than its previous value.
- `i`: Again, `i` is the same as the previous `i`.

Therefore, the print statement will output a string with the following components:
- A question mark (`?`)
- The value of `mak` (which is unknown)
- The value of `mak` (which is unknown again)
- The value of `i` (one more than its previous value)
- The value of `i` (same as the previous `i`)

Output: **'? [mak] [mak] [i] [i]** (where `[mak]` is the value of `mak` and `[i]` is the value of `i` which is one more than its previous value)
