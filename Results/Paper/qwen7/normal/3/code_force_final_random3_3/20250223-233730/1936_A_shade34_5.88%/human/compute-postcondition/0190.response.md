Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `mak` is `i + 1`, `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not change any variable values but ensures that any buffered output is written to the console immediately. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
