Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Descriptions:**
   - `i` is less than `len(pans)` and equal to `mak + 1`.
   - `mak` is equal to `i + 1`.
   - The input equals '>'.
   - The input has been read.

2. **Determine the Values:**
   - From `i = mak + 1` and `mak = i + 1`, we can infer that `i` and `mak` are consecutive indices. Let's denote `i` as `n` and `mak` as `n+1` for simplicity.
   - Since `i` is less than `len(pans)`, `n < len(pans)`.
   - Given `mak = i + 1`, if `i = n`, then `mak = n + 1`.

3. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])`.
   - Substitute the values from the initial state:
     - `pans[mak]` is the same as `pans[n+1]`.
     - `pans[i]` is the same as `pans[n]`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output: `'?' followed by the value of `pans[n+1]` twice, followed by the value of `pans[n]` twice.
   - In terms of the variables, it will be: `'? [pans[n+1]] [pans[n+1]] [pans[n]] [pans[n]]'`.

Output: **'? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[i]] [pans[i]]'**
