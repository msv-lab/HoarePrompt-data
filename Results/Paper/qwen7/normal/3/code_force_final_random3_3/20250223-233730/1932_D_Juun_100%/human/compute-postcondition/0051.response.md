Output State: **`suits` dictionary remains unchanged, `trumps` is a non-empty list with one element less than before, `answers` list is ready to receive a new element and we continue with the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed to the next iteration. No variables are modified by this statement, so the values of `suits`, `trumps`, and `answers` remain as they were in the initial state.
