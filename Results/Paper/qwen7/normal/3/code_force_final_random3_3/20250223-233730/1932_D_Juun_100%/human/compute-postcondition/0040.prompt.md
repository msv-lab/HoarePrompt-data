Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trumps` is an empty list, `trump` is the input from the user, `answers` is an empty list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values all set to None.
Code of the loop:
for card in input().split():
    rank, suit = card
    if suit == trump:
        trumps.append(rank)
    elif suits[suit] is not None:
        answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit],
            rank])]))
        suits[suit] = None
    else:
        suits[suit] = rank


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `rank` is the rank part of `card`; `suit` is the suit part of `card`. If `suit` is equal to `trump`, then `trumps` is a list with the value of `rank` appended to it. Otherwise, if `suits[suit]` is `None`, then `answers` now contains one more element which is the result of ' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]). If `suits[suit]` is not `None`, then `suits[suit]` is set to `rank`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `card` is no longer used, `rank` is the rank part of the original `card`, `suit` is the suit part of the original `card`, `trumps` is unchanged, and `suits[suit]` is set to either `None` with `answers` containing one more element which is a string formed by joining the sorted values of `None` and `rank` with a space in between, or `suits[suit]` is set to `rank` with `answers` containing one more element if `suits[suit]` is `None`, otherwise `suits[suit]` is set to `rank`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `card` is no longer used, `rank` is the rank part of the original `card`, `suit` is the suit part of the original `card`, `trumps` is unchanged, and `suits[suit]` is set to `rank`. Additionally, `answers` now contains one more element. If `suits[suit]` was `None`, then `answers` contains a string formed by joining `None` and `rank` with a space in between. Otherwise, `suits[suit]` remains `rank` and `answers` contains the updated `rank`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
