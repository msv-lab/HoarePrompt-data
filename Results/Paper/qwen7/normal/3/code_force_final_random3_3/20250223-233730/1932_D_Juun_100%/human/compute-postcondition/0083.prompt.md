Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `trumps` is an empty list, `suits` remains unchanged, and `answers` contains all valid pairs of ranks for each suit where both ranks were found, formatted as strings like 'rank1suit1 trumps.pop()trump' for each iteration until no more pairs can be formed.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `trumps` is not empty. Each iteration of the loop pops two elements from `trumps` and prints them in the specified format. Since the loop removes elements from `trumps` in each iteration, it will continue until `trumps` is empty. At that point, the loop terminates, leaving `trumps` as an empty list. The value of `suits` remains unchanged throughout the loop, and `answers` accumulates all valid pairs of ranks for each suit that were found during the iterations.
Code of the loop:
for answer in answers:
    print(answer)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: 

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `answer` is the next element in the `answers` list, `answers` is the original list minus the first element

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `answer` is the next element in the `answers` list minus the first two elements, `answers` is the original list minus the first two elements




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
