Output State: **`card` is no longer used, `rank` is the rank part of the original `card`, `suit` is the suit part of the original `card`, `trumps` is unchanged, `suits[suit]` is `None`, and `answers` now contains one additional element.**

Explanation: The code `suits[suit] = None` sets the value of `suits[suit]` to `None`. This updates the value of `suits[suit]` from its previous state (either `rank` or `None`) to `None`. The other variables (`card`, `rank`, `suit`, `trumps`, and `answers`) remain unchanged, with `answers` now containing one additional element due to the assignment operation.
