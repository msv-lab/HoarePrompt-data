Output State: **`trumps` is a non-empty list with one element less than before, `suit` is `next_suit`, `rank` is `next_rank`, `answers` has a new element which is a string formatted as 'next_ranknext_suit trumps.pop()', we continue the loop.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the `answers` list. This new element is a formatted string combining `next_rank`, `next_suit`, and the popped element from `trumps`. After executing the code, `trumps` will have one less element than before, `suit` remains `next_suit`, `rank` remains `next_rank`, and `answers` contains the new string. The loop continues as per the postcondition.
