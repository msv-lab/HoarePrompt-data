Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trumps` is an empty list, `trump` is the input from the user, `answers` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `answers`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `trumps`, or `trump`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.
