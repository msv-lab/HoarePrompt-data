Postcondition: `rank` is the rank part of `card`; `suit` is the suit part of `card`. If `suit` is equal to `trump`, then `trumps` is a list with the value of `rank` appended to it. Otherwise, `suit` is not equal to `trump`. If `suits[suit]` is `None`, then `answers` now contains one more element which is the result of `' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])])`. Otherwise, `suits[suit]` is set to `rank`.
