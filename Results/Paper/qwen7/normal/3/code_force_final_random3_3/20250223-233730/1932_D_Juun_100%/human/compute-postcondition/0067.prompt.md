Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: All cards have been processed, `trumps` contains all ranks of cards that match the `trump` suit, `suits` dictionary has been updated such that for each suit, either `None` is stored (indicating no valid rank was found for that suit) or the highest rank found for that suit is stored, and `answers` contains all valid pairs of ranks for each suit where both ranks were found.
Code of the loop:
for suit, rank in suits.items():
    if rank is None:
        continue
    if trumps != []:
        answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
    else:
        print('IMPOSSIBLE')
        return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The `suits` dictionary remains unchanged, `trumps` is a non-empty list with one element less than before, `answers` list has a new element which is a string formatted as f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The `suits` dictionary remains unchanged, `trumps` is a non-empty list with one element less than before, `answers` list has a new element which is a string formatted as 'rank{suit} trumps.pop()'. We continue with the next iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `trumps` is a non-empty list with one element less than before, `suit` is `next_suit`, `rank` is `next_rank`, `answers` has a new element which is a string formatted as 'next_ranknext_suit trumps.pop()', and the loop continues.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
