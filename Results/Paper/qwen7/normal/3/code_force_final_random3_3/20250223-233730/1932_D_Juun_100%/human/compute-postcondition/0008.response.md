Output State: **`rank` is the rank part of `card`; `suit` is the suit part of `card` which is equal to `trump`; `trumps` is a list with the value of `rank` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `rank` to the list `trumps`. The values of `rank` and `suit` remain unchanged, with `suit` still being equal to `trump`.
