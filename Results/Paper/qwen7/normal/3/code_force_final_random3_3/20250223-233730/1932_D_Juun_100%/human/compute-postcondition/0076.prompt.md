Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `trumps` is a sorted list of its original elements in descending order, `suits` remains unchanged, and `answers` contains all valid pairs of ranks for each suit where both ranks were found, formatted as strings like 'rank1suit1 trumps.pop()trump' for each iteration.
Code of the loop:
while trumps != []:
    print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `trumps` is a sorted list of its original elements in descending order and must contain at least one element, `suits` remains unchanged, and `answers` contains all valid pairs of ranks for each suit where both ranks were found, formatted as strings like 'rank1suit1 trumps.pop()trump' for each iteration.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `trumps` is a sorted list of its original elements in descending order and must contain at least one element, `suits` remains unchanged, and `answers` contains all valid pairs of ranks for each suit where both ranks were found
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `trumps` is a sorted list of its original elements in descending order and must contain at least one element, `suits` remains unchanged, and `answers` contains all valid pairs of ranks for each suit where both ranks were found


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
