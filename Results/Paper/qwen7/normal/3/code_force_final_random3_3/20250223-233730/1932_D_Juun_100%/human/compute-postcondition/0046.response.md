Output State: **The `suits` dictionary remains unchanged, `trumps` is a non-empty list with one element less than before, `answers` list has a new element which is a string formatted as f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}'.**

Explanation:
- The `suits` dictionary remains unchanged because no operation was performed on it.
- The `trumps` list loses one element due to `trumps.pop()`, which removes and returns the last element of the list. Since `trumps` was initially non-empty, it now has one less element.
- The `answers` list gains a new element, which is a formatted string combining `rank`, `suit`, the popped element from `trumps`, and `trump`.
