Output State: **`q` is a perfect square, `w` is an integer greater than 0, there exists an integer `i` such that `q % i == 0`, and the current value of `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`; `M` is a list containing the value of `i`.**

Explanation: The code `M += [i]` appends the value of `i` to the list `M`. Since `i` is an integer such that `q % i == 0`, and its current value is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, this value is added to the list `M`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
