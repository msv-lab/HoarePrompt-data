You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = L[0]
    x = L[1]
    ans = 0
    y = n + x
    if y % 2 != 0:
        print(0)
        continue
    else:
        L1 = func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)
        if n >= 3 * x - 2:
            L1 += func_1((n - x) // 2, x)
        L1 = list(set(L1))
        print(len(L1))
        continue

def func_1(q, x):
    M = []
    w = math.sqrt(q)
    if w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1:
        M += [w]
    for i in range(1, int(w // 1)):
        if q % i == 0:
            if i >= x - 1:
                M += [i]
            if q // i >= x - 1:
                M += [q // i]
    return M



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts two parameters, q and x. q is an integer representing the position in the line, and x is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling. The function calculates all divisors of q that are greater than or equal to x - 1 and returns them in a list M. If the square root of q (denoted as w) is an integer and greater than or equal to x - 1, it is added to the list M. The function then iterates through numbers from 1 to the integer part of the square root of q, checking if they are divisors of q and if they are greater than or equal to x - 1, adding them to the list M. Similarly, it checks their corresponding divisors (q divided by the current number) and adds those to the list M if they meet the criteria.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` is used in an incorrect manner. The function `func_1` is supposed to generate a list of possible values for `k` based on certain conditions, but its implementation does not align with the problem description.

Let's analyze the issue:

1. The variable `y` is calculated as `n + x`. If `y` is odd, the program prints `0`, which is correct because no valid `k` exists for odd `y`.

2. When `y` is even, the program calls `func_1` with `(y - 2) // 2` and `x`. However, the logic inside `func_1` does not correctly determine the valid values of `k`.

3. The condition `if w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1` is incorrect. It checks if `w` is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`, but this does not correctly determine the valid values of `k`.

4. The loop `for i in range(1, int(w // 1))` is also problematic. It should iterate over the divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

To fix this, the function `func_1` should be revised to correctly generate the valid values of `k` based on the conditions described in the problem. Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(q, x):
    M = []
    for i in range(x - 1, q + 1):
        if q % i == 0 and i <= q // i:
            M.append(i)
    return M
```

With this corrected function, the main program would look like this:

```python
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = L[0]
    x = L[1]
    ans = 0
    y = n + x
    if y % 2 != 0:
        print(0)
        continue
    else:
        L1 = func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)
        if n >= 3 * x - 2:
            L1 += func_1((n - x) // 2, x)
        L1 = list(set(L1))
        print(len(L1))
        continue
```

This corrected version should handle all cases correctly according to the problem description.
