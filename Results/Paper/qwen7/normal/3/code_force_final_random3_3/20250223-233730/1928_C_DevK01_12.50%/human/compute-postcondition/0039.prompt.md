Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Postcondition: `q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 <= x < n <= 10^9), `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 <= x < q), `M` is a list containing one element which is the square root of `q` (denoted as `w`), and `w` is the square root of `q` and is an integer. If `w` is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `w` remains unchanged. Otherwise, no change occurs in the list `M`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, int(w // 1)):
    if q % i == 0:
        if i >= x - 1:
            M += [i]
        if q // i >= x - 1:
            M += [q // i]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `q` is a perfect square, `w` is an integer greater than 0, and there exists an integer `i` such that `q % i == 0`. If the current value of `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` is a list containing the value of `q // i`. Otherwise, `M` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `q` is a perfect square, `w` is an integer greater than 0, and there exists an integer `i` such that `q % i == 0` and `i` is `i + 1`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` is a list containing the value of `i`. Otherwise, `M` remains unchanged, and `M` is updated by adding `q // i` to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `q` is a perfect square, `w` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, and `M` is a list. If `q // i >= x - 1`, then `M` is updated with the value of `q // i`. Otherwise, `M` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
