Output State: **`q` is a perfect square, `w` is an integer greater than 0, and there exists an integer `i` such that `q % i == 0` and `i` is `i + 1`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` is a list containing the value of `i`. Otherwise, `M` remains unchanged; `M` is updated by adding `q // i` to it.**

Explanation: The code `M += [q // i]` appends the value of `q // i` to the list `M`. The conditions regarding `q`, `w`, `i`, and `M` remain the same as the initial state, except that `M` now includes the new value `q // i`.
