Postcondition: `q` is a perfect square, `w` is an integer greater than 0, and there exists an integer `i` such that `q % i == 0` and `i` is `i + 1`. If `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `M` is a list containing the value of `i`; otherwise, `M` remains unchanged, and `M` is updated by adding `q // i` to it.
