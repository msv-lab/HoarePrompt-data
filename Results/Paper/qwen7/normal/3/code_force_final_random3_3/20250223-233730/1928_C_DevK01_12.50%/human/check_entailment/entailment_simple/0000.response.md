### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - The problem requires determining the number of possible values for \( k \) such that the given position \( n \) and the number \( x \) Vasya received during the settling can be correctly explained by the described pattern.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k-2 \) positions, with the first \( k \) positions being numbered \( 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k \), the next \( k-2 \) positions being numbered \( k-1, k-2, \ldots, 2 \), and so on.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The key observation is that the position \( n \) modulo \( 2k-2 \) should match the number \( x \) according to the settling pattern.
   - The function `func_1` is designed to find all divisors of \( q = \frac{y-2}{2} \) that are greater than or equal to \( x-1 \).

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function calculates the divisors of \( q \) and checks if they are greater than or equal to \( x-1 \).
   - It uses the square root of \( q \) to optimize the divisor search, ensuring that all divisors are considered.

4. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It calculates \( y = n + x \) and checks if \( y \) is even.
   - If \( y \) is even, it calls `func_1` with appropriate parameters and prints the length of the resulting list.

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The constraints \( 1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9 \) and \( 1 \leq x < q \) are handled correctly.
   - The logic for handling the divisors and checking conditions is sound.

6. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The provided code correctly identifies the divisors of \( q \) and filters them based on the condition \( x-1 \).
   - The logic for determining the number of valid \( k \) values is consistent with the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of valid \( k \) values for the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
