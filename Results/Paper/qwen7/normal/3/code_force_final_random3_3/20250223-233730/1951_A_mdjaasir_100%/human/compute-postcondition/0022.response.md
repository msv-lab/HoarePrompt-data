Output: **NO**

Explanation:
- The precondition states that `count` is exactly 2, meaning the string `a` contains exactly two '1's.
- It also states that `a[a.index('1') + 1]` is '1', which means that there is another '1' immediately following the first '1' found in the string `a`.
- Given this information, the condition that would typically trigger a different output (e.g., 'YES') is not met, so the print statement simply outputs 'NO'.
