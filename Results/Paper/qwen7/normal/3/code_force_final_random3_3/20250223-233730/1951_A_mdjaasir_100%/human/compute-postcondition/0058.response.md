Postcondition: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is the newly input string, `count` is the number of '1's in the string `a`. If the character following the first '1' in the string `a` is not '1', the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.**
