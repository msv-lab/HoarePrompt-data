Postcondition: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string from the user, `count` is the number of '1's in the string `a`, and `count` is either exactly 2 (with the string `a` having either at least two '1's where the second '1' is not immediately followed by another '1', or the second '1' is immediately followed by another '1'), or `count` is not equal to 2, but `count` is greater than 0 or `count` is even.
