Output State: **`a` is the next element in the tuple `inp`, `x` is unchanged, `y` is now equal to `a`, `ans` is unchanged.**

The code assigns the value of `a` to `y`. The values of `a`, `x`, `y`, and `ans` are updated accordingly. The initial state of `x` and `ans` remains unchanged, and `y` is now equal to the value of `a`.
