Output State: **`a` is assigned to `x`, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an updated input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\), `x` is now equal to `a`, `y` remains \(n + 1\).**

This means that the value of `x` has been updated to be equal to `a`, while all other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
