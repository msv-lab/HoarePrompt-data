Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\), `inp` is a non-empty tuple containing integers from the input split by spaces, `x` is \(n + 1\), `y` is \(n + 1\), `ans` is 1 if the next element in `inp` is less than or equal to `x`, otherwise `ans` is 0, and `a` is the second element of `inp`, `x` is equal to `y`.**

Explanation: The code `x == y` checks if `x` is equal to `y`. Since both `x` and `y` are defined as `n + 1`, they are inherently equal. No other variables are affected by this line of code, so their states remain unchanged.
