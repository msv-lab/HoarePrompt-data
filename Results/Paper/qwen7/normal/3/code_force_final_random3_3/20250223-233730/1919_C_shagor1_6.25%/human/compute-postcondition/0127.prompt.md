Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case contains an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    *inp, = map(int, input().split())
    x = y = n + 1
    ans = 0
    for a in inp:
        if a <= x:
            x = a
        elif a <= y:
            y = a
        else:
            x == y
            y = a
            ans += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\), `inp` is a non-empty tuple containing integers from the input split by spaces, `x` is the minimum value in `inp`, `y` is the second smallest value in `inp` if there are at least two distinct elements in `inp`, otherwise `y` is `x` or remains \(n + 1\) if no smaller elements are found, and `ans` is the count of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is the last element of the tuple `inp`, `ans` is a non-negative integer (either 0, 1, or the total number of iterations), `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an updated input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\), `x` and `y` are both \(n + 1\).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations, `a` is the last element of the tuple `inp`, `x` is the minimum value among all elements of `inp` that are less than or equal to `x` seen so far, `y` is the minimum value among all elements of `inp` that are greater than `x` but less than or equal to `y` seen so far, and `ans` is the count of elements in `inp` that are greater than `y`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
