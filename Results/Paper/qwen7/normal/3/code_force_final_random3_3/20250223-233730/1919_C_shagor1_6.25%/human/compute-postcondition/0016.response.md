Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\), `inp` is a non-empty tuple containing integers from the input split by spaces, `x` is \(n + 1\), `y` is now `a`, `ans` is 1, `a` is the first element of `inp`, and `a > y`.**

Explanation: The line `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. Initially, `ans` was 0. After executing this line, `ans` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given conditions.
