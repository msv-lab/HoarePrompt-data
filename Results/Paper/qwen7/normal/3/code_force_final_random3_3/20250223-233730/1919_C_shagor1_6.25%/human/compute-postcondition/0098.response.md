Output State: **`a` is the last element of the tuple `inp`, and `a` is greater than `x`, and `a` is greater than `y`, and `x` is equal to `y`**.

Explanation: The code `x == y` checks if `x` is equal to `y`. Since the initial condition states that `a` is the last element of the tuple `inp`, and `a` is greater than both `x` and `y`, the values of `x` and `y` are made equal by the code. Therefore, the new state includes that `x` is now equal to `y`, while `a` remains the last element of the tuple `inp` and is still greater than both `x` and `y`.
