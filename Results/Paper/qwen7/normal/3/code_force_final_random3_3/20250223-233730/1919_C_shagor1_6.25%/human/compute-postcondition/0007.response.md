Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\), `inp` is a non-empty tuple containing integers from the input split by spaces, `x` is `a`, `y` is \(n + 1\), `ans` is 0, `a` is the first element of `inp`.**

Explanation: The code `x = a` updates the value of `x` to be equal to `a`. All other variables remain unchanged. Since `a` is the first element of `inp` and is less than or equal to `x`, `x` now holds the value of `a`.
