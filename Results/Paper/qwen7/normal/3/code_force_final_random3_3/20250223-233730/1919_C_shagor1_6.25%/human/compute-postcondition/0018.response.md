Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\), `inp` is a non-empty tuple containing integers from the input split by spaces, `x` is \(n + 1\), `y` is \(n + 1\), `ans` is 1 if `a <= x` or `a <= y` holds true, and `a` is the first element of `inp`.
