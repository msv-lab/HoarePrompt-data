Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\), `inp` is a non-empty tuple containing integers from the input split by spaces, `x` is the minimum value in `inp`, `y` is the second smallest value in `inp` if there are at least two distinct elements in `inp`, otherwise `y` is `x` or remains \(n + 1\) if no smaller elements are found, and `ans` is the count of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`, and the user provides another input for the next iteration; `n` is updated to the new input integer.**

This means that the value of `n` has been updated to the new input integer, while the other variables retain their previous values and conditions.
