Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic for determining the minimum penalty is flawed. Here's an example where the program does not work as expected:

Consider the input:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

The expected output is `3`, but let's see what the program outputs:

- The program initializes `x` and `y` to `n + 1`, which is `6`.
- It iterates through the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

Let's trace the execution step-by-step:
1. `a = 1`: `x` becomes `1` (since `1 <= x`), `y` remains `6`.
2. `a = 2`: `x` remains `1` (since `2 > 1` and `2 > y`), `y` becomes `2`.
3. `a = 3`: `x` remains `1` (since `3 > 1` and `3 > y`), `y` becomes `3`.
4. `a = 4`: `x` remains `1` (since `4 > 1` and `4 > y`), `y` becomes `4`.
5. `a = 5`: `x` remains `1` (since `5 > 1` and `5 > y`), `y` becomes `5`.

At the end, `ans` is `1` because `x` and `y` were updated only once when encountering `2`, `3`, `4`, and `5`. However, the correct minimum penalty should be `3` because we can split the array into `[1]` and `[2, 3, 4, 5]`, resulting in penalties `0` and `2` respectively, summing up to `3`.

Thus, the program does not handle the problem correctly and fails to find the optimal split for this and potentially other cases.
