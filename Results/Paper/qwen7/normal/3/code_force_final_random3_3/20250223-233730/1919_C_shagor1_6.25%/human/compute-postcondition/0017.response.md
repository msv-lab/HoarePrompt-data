Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\), `inp` is a non-empty tuple containing integers from the input split by spaces, `x` is \(n + 1\), `y` is either `a` (where `a` is the first element of `inp`), `ans` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `a <= y` holds true, and `a` is the first element of `inp` and `a > x`.**
