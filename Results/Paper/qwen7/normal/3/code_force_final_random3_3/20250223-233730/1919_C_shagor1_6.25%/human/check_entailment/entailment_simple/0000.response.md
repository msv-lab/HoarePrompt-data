Reasoning:
The given program aims to calculate the minimum possible penalty by splitting the array into two subsequences \(s\) and \(t\) and then computing the penalties for both subsequences. The provided solution iterates through the array and maintains two variables, `x` and `y`, to track the smallest and the second smallest unique elements encountered so far. If an element is greater than `y`, it increments the penalty counter `ans`. This approach is correct because:

1. **Initialization**: `x` and `y` are initialized to `n + 1`, which ensures that any element in the array will be smaller initially.
2. **Tracking Minimums**: As the loop progresses, `x` and `y` are updated to keep track of the smallest and the second smallest unique elements encountered.
3. **Penalty Calculation**: If an element is greater than `y`, it means this element is part of a subsequence that has a higher penalty, thus incrementing `ans`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by ensuring that the penalty is minimized by splitting the array into two parts where the penalty is the sum of non-decreasing sequences in each part.

Correctness: **True**
