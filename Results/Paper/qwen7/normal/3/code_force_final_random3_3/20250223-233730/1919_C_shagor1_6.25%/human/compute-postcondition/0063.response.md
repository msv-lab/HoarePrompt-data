Output State: **`a` is the second element of the tuple `inp`, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an updated input integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq t\), `x` is \(n + 1\), `y` is \(n + 1\), and `x == y` is evaluated to True.**

Explanation: The code `x == y` checks if `x` is equal to `y`. Given that both `x` and `y` are defined as `n + 1`, they are inherently equal. Therefore, the condition `x == y` evaluates to `True`. The values of other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
