Output State: `wins` is 5, `win_with_swap` is 7, `i` is 8, `k` is greater than 8.

Explanation: Based on the given information, the loop continues to execute as long as `wins < k`. After the third iteration, `wins` remains 5, `win_with_swap` is 7, `i` is 8, and `k` is greater than 8. Since `wins` does not change within the loop body and the loop condition `wins < k` is no longer satisfied (assuming `k` does not change or stay greater than 8), the loop will terminate. Therefore, after all iterations, `wins` will still be 5, `win_with_swap` will be 7, `i` will be 8, and `k` will be greater than 8.
