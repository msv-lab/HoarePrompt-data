You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n; a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i's are distinct.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    wins = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        
        wins += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `wins` is 3, `i` is 9999, `n` is at least 2, and `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to increment `wins` as long as `a[i]` is less than or equal to `a[k-1]`. After 3 iterations, `wins` is 3. Since the loop condition is based on the index `i`, which ranges from 0 to `n-1`, the loop will stop either when `i` reaches `n` or when it finds an element in `a` that is greater than `a[k-1]`. Given that the loop executed 3 times, `i` would be 3 before the next iteration would check the condition. However, since the problem specifies the loop executes exactly 3 times, `i` must be 2 after the third iteration, meaning the fourth iteration (where `i` would be 3) would not occur because the loop would have already broken or completed its full range. Therefore, `i` could be up to 9999 (assuming `n` is at least 10000, given the constraints), but in the context of the problem, it would be the maximum value `n` can take, which is 100000, minus the number of iterations already performed, adjusted to fit within the loop's range. The other variables (`n` and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial or previous states.
    if (wins >= k) :
        print(wins - 1)
        #This is printed: 2
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State: `wins` is 3, `i` is 9999, `n` is at least 2, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, and the condition `wins < k` holds true
    win_with_swap = wins + 1
    for i in range(win_with_swap, k - 1):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        
        win_with_swap += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `wins` is 5, `win_with_swap` is 8, `i` is 9, `k` is an integer greater than 8.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to increment `win_with_swap` as long as `a[i]` is greater than `a[k-1]`. After the third iteration, `win_with_swap` becomes 7 and `i` is 8. Since `k` must be greater than 8 for the loop to continue, we can deduce that after all iterations, `win_with_swap` will be incremented one more time (making it 8), and `i` will be set to `win_with_swap + 1`, which is 9. The value of `wins` remains unchanged at 5 because the condition `wins < k` was met initially but does not change within the loop. `k` itself is not modified by the loop, so it remains an integer greater than 8.
    print(max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)))
    #This is printed: 4
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter t, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. For each test case, it also accepts two integers n and k, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and a list a of n distinct integers, each between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. After processing these inputs, the function does not return any value (returns None).

Return Postconditions: The program returns None


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
