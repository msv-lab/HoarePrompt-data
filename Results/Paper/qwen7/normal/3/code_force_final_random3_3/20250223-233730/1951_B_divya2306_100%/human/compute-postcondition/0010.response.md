Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `wins` is increased by 1 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` must be at least 2.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to continue, `n` must still be at least 2.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, so `i` will become 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`wins` is increased by 1, `i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2**
