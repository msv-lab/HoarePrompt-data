Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 2, and the element `a[i]` is greater than `a[k-1]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `i`, `n`, or the condition involving `a[i]` and `a[k-1]`. It only indicates that the loop or conditional block is exited.
