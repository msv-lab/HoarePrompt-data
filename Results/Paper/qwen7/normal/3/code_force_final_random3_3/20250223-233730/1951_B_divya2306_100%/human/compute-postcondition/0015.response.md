Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `wins` is 2 (this variable is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted).
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be at least 2.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 2.
   - For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be at least 2.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `wins` remains 2.
   - `i` becomes 2.
   - `n` must still be at least 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`wins` is 2, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2**.
