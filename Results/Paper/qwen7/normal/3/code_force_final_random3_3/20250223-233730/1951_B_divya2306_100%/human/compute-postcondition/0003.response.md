Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n):`. The objects involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 until it reaches `n`.
   - The variable `n` determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

3. **Check the given initial states**:
   - `wins` is 0.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\).
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 0`, we need to set `i` to 0.
   - The value of `n` must be within the specified range, so we need to ensure `n` is at least 2 (since \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 2**
