The provided function `generate` does not seem to directly relate to the problem description given. The function appears to be generating some factors related to prime numbers, but it doesn't align with the context of the settling positions problem. Therefore, I will focus on extracting the precondition based on the variables in the problem description.

Given the problem description and the input/output format, let's extract the precondition:

**Problem Description:** In a physical education lesson, students settle into positions based on a repeating pattern defined by \( k \). The goal is to determine how many possible values of \( k \) fit the given constraints based on Vasya's position \( n \) and the number he received during the settling \( x \).

**Precondition:**
**t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and x, where 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, representing Vasya's position in the line and the number he received during the settling, respectively.**
