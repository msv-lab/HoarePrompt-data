Output State: **`prime_to_i` is equal to 1**

The initial state was that `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime`. However, the code snippet sets `prime_to_i` directly to 1, overriding its previous value. Therefore, `prime_to_i` is now explicitly set to 1. The value of `prime` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
