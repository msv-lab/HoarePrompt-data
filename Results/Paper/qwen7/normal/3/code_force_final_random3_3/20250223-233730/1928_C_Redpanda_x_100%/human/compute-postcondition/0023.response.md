Output State: **`prime_to_i` is equal to `prime * prime_to_i`, `factors[prime]` is greater than or equal to 1, `factor` is the next element in `rest`, and `rest` contains the remaining elements after removing the current `factor`; `prime_to_i` is updated by yielding `factor * prime_to_i`.**

Explanation: The code `yield factor * prime_to_i` yields the value of `factor * prime_to_i`. This does not change the values of the other variables but indicates that the value of `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded. The conditions and relationships between the other variables remain unchanged.
