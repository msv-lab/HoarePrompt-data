Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `k` is an integer, `primes` is a list of integers, the length of `primes` is not equal to `k`, `prime` is the k-th element in the `primes` list, `rest` is the result of calling `generate(k + 1)`
Code of the loop:
for factor in rest:
    prime_to_i = 1
    for _ in range(factors[prime] + 1):
        yield factor * prime_to_i
        prime_to_i *= prime


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: After all iterations, `prime_to_i` will be equal to the original value multiplied by `prime` raised to the power of `factors[prime]`, and `factors[prime]` will be set to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime ** (factors[prime] + 1)`, `factors[prime]` is equal to -1 (indicating that the prime factorization of `prime` has been fully processed), `factor` is the next element in `rest`, and `rest` contains the remaining elements after removing the current `factor`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `prime_to_i` will be updated to the power of `prime` based on its count in `factors`, `factors[prime]` will be set to -1 to indicate that all occurrences of `prime` as a factor have been processed, and the `factor` and `rest` variables will retain their state from the last iteration of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime` raised to the power of the original value of `factors[prime]`, `factors` is a dictionary that must contain the key `prime`, and the value associated with `prime` is now `0`, and a series of values equal to `factor * prime_to_i` are yielded.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `prime_to_i` will hold the value of `prime` multiplied by itself as many times as the initial value of `factors[prime]`. The `factors[prime]` value will be reduced to `0` since the loop runs `factors[prime] + 1` times, decrementing the value each time until it reaches `0`. The loop yields values of `factor * prime_to_i` for each iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
