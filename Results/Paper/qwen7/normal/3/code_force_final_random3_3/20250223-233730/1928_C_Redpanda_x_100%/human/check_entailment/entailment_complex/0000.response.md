### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the number of possible values of \( k \) such that the given position \( n \) and number \( x \) fit the settling pattern described.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code iterates over test cases and for each test case, it calculates the possible values of \( k \).
   - It uses a generator function `func_1` to get the prime factors of \( n - x \) and \( n + x - 2 \).
   - The generator function `generate` is used to yield combinations of these prime factors.

3. **Key Points:**
   - The code correctly identifies the range of \( k \) values by checking if \( k / 2 + 1 \geq x \).
   - It uses the prime factors to form potential \( k \) values by combining them.
   - The logic for generating \( k \) values seems correct based on the problem statement.

4. **Verification:**
   - The code handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.
   - The use of sets ensures that duplicate \( k \) values are not counted multiple times.
   - The final count of valid \( k \) values is printed correctly.

5. **Testing the Functions:**
   - The `func_1` function correctly computes the prime factors.
   - The `generate` function correctly generates the combinations of prime factors to form \( k \).

Given the analysis, the code appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.
