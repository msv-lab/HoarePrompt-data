Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `ans` is the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, and `cnt` is incremented by 1 if `arr[i]` equals `val`.**

Explanation: The code snippet updates `ans` to be the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`. It also increments `cnt` by 1 if `arr[i]` equals `val`. The initial conditions about the existence of an index `i` such that either `arr[i]` equals `val` or `arr[i]` does not equal `val` and `i` is incremented by 1 remain valid. However, since the exact values of `ans`, `cnt`, and `i` are not specified, we only update `cnt` to reflect the increment.
