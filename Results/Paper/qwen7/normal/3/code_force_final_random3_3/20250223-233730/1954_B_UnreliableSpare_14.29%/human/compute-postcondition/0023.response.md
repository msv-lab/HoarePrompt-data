Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of Variables in the Loop Head**:
   - `i` is initially set to `n-1`.
   - `n` remains as the original input integer.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will iterate from `i = n-1` down to `i = 0`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = n-1`, the loop will execute if `n-1 >= 0`, which simplifies to `n >= 1`.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

5. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`ans`, `arr`, `flag`, `val`, `cnt`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
