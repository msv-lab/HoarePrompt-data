Postcondition: `arr` is a list of integers, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt` for each iteration, `cnt` is incremented by 1 for each element in `arr`, and `i` is equal to `n` (the length of `arr`). Whether `flag` is True or False, `ans` reflects the minimum value between its initial value and the count of elements processed in `arr`.
