Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the size of the array (`n`) and the array itself (`arr`).

2. **Checking if Array is Already Non-Beautiful**: The program checks if the array is already non-beautiful by verifying if there exists any index `i` where `arr[i] != arr[i - 1]`. This is done using the `flag` variable. However, the logic here is flawed because it only sets `flag` to `False` if the first pair of elements is different. It should iterate through the entire array to ensure no such pair exists.

3. **Finding Minimum Removals**: The program attempts to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It does this by counting consecutive occurrences of the same element and keeping track of the minimum count. However, the logic for updating `ans` is incorrect. It should update `ans` with the minimum count of consecutive elements found, but the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

4. **Printing the Result**: The program prints `-1` if the array is already non-beautiful (based on the flawed `flag` check) and otherwise prints `ans`. However, the `ans` calculation is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above.

Given these points, the program is not correctly implemented to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
