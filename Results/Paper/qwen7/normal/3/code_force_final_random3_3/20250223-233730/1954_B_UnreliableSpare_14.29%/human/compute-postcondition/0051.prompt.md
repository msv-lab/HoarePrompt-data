You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5; the array a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and the array a is beautiful; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
        
    #State: The loop has executed all iterations. The value of `i` is `n-1`, `n` remains as the original input integer, `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]`, and `flag` remains False since no break occurs in the if condition throughout all iterations.
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    val, cnt = arr[0], 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `arr` is a list of integers, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt` for each iteration, `cnt` is incremented by 1 for each element in `arr`, and `i` is equal to `n` (the length of `arr`).
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: 0
    #State: Postcondition: `arr` is a list of integers, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt` for each iteration, `cnt` is incremented by 1 for each element in `arr`, and `i` is equal to `n` (the length of `arr`). Whether `flag` is True or False, `ans` reflects the minimum value between its initial value and the count of elements processed in `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), and an array a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The array a is considered beautiful. For each test case, the function determines and returns whether the array a meets certain criteria or computes a specific value based on the given conditions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
