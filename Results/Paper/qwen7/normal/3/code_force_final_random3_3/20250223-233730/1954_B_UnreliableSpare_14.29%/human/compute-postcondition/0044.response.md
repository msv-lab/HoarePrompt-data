Based on the initial state provided:

- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt` for each iteration.
- `cnt` is incremented by 1 for each element in `arr`.
- `i` is equal to `n`, where `n` is the length of `arr`.
- The flag is True.

The print statement is `print(-1)`. This statement directly prints the value `-1` without any reference to the variables `arr`, `ans`, `cnt`, or `i`.

Output: **-1**
