Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5.**

The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The precondition that `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5` is now dependent on the input, but the initial constraint that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4` remains valid.
