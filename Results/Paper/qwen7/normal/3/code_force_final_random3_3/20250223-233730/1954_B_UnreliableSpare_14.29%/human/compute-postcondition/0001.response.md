Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input by spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `arr` by taking input as a string, splitting it into individual elements based on spaces, and then converting each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
