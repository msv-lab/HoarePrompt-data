Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is between 2 and 200000 inclusive, `s` is 2, `arr` contains two elements [(1, 1, 0), (2, 2, num)]**.

Explanation: The variable `s` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 2. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 2, `n` remains between 2 and 200000 inclusive, `s` is now 2, and `arr` retains its original structure.
