Output State: **`i` is 3, `N` is between 2 and 200000 inclusive, `s` is 3, `arr` contains three elements \([(1, 1, 0), (2, 2, num), (3, 3, num)]\)**

Explanation: The code `s = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 3) to `s`. All other variables (`N`, `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
