Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is between 2 and 200000 inclusive, `s` is 0, `arr` contains two elements [(1, 1, 0), (2, 2, num)]**.

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` to the list `arr`. Initially, `s` is 0 and `i` is 1, so the appended tuple is `(1 + 0, 1, num)`, which simplifies to `(1, 1, num)`. After appending, `i` is incremented to 2 because the original value of `i` was used in the tuple, and now `i` should be the next value, which is 2. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and `s` also remains 0. The list `arr` now contains two elements: the original element `(1, 1, 0)` and the newly appended element `(1, 1, num)`. Since `num` is not specified, it remains as `num`.
