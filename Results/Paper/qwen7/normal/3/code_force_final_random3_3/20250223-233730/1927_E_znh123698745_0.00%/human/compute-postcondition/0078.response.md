Output State: **`k` is the input value of `k` decremented by 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `array` is a list containing numbers from 1 to `n`, `answer` is a list containing the number 1 and 2, `a` is a list containing [2, -1]**.

Explanation: The code `answer.append(array[a[-1]])` appends the element at the index specified by `a[-1]` to the `answer` list. Since `a` is `[2, -1]`, `a[-1]` is `-1`. The `array` list contains numbers from 1 to `n`, and since `a[-1]` is `-1`, the last element of `array` (which is `n`) is appended to `answer`. Given that `answer` initially contained `[1]` and the first element of `array` (which is `1`) or the element at index `-1` of `a` (which is `-2`) is `2`, the updated `answer` list is `[1, 2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
