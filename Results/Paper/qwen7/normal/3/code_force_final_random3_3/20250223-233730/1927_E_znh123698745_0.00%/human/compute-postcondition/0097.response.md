Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \). It then generates a permutation of the first \( n-1 \) natural numbers based on the parity of \( n-1 \) and prints this permutation. The function does not return any value but prints the generated permutation for each test case.**
