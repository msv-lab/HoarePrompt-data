You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        array = list(range(1, n + 1))
        answer = [1]
        a = [1, -1]
        for i in range(1, n):
            if (-1) ** i == -1:
                answer.append(array[a[-1]])
                a[-1] -= 1
            else:
                answer.append(array[a[0]])
                a[0] += 1
        print(*answer)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \). It then generates a permutation of the first \( n-1 \) natural numbers based on the parity of \( n-1 \) and prints this permutation. The function does not return any value but prints the generated permutation for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly generates a k-level permutation for the given problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The program initializes an array `array` with values from 1 to `n`.
   - It starts with `answer` as `[1]`.
   - It uses two pointers `a` initialized as `[1, -1]`.

3. **Building the Permutation**:
   - The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` to build the permutation.
   - If `(-1) ** i == -1`, it appends `array[a[-1]]` to `answer` and decrements `a[-1]`.
   - Otherwise, it appends `array[a[0]]` to `answer` and increments `a[0]`.

4. **Output**:
   - The constructed `answer` is printed.

### Checking the Correctness:

To verify if this approach generates a k-level permutation, we need to ensure that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` do not differ by more than 1.

#### Example Analysis:

Let's take the example provided in the problem statement for `n=10` and `k=4`:
- The initial array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`.
- The constructed answer is `[1, 6, 3, 7, 2, 5, 4, 9, 8, 10]`.

Now, let's calculate the sums of continuous segments of length 4:
- `s[0] = 1 + 6 + 3 + 7 = 17`
- `s[1] = 6 + 3 + 7 + 2 = 18`
- `s[2] = 3 + 7 + 2 + 5 = 17`
- `s[3] = 7 + 2 + 5 + 4 = 18`
- `s[4] = 2 + 5 + 4 + 9 = 20`
- `s[5] = 5 + 4 + 9 + 8 = 26`
- `s[6] = 4 + 9 + 8 + 10 = 31`

The maximum value in `s` is 31 and the minimum value is 17. The difference between the maximum and minimum is `31 - 17 = 14`, which is greater than 1. Therefore, this permutation is not k-level.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly generate a k-level permutation. The approach used in the program does not ensure that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.
