Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and k is even; the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    array = list(range(1, n + 1))
    answer = [1]
    a = [1, -1]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if (-1) ** i == -1:
            answer.append(array[a[-1]])
            a[-1] -= 1
        else:
            answer.append(array[a[0]])
            a[0] += 1
    print(*answer)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The loop will continue to append elements to `answer` based on the conditions provided until it has iterated `n-1` times. After all iterations, `answer` will contain `n-1` elements. 

If `(-1) ** i` equals -1, the element from `array` at index `a[-1] - 1` will be appended to `answer`, and `a[-1]` will be decremented by 1. Otherwise, the element from `array` at index `a[0]` will be appended to `answer`, and `a[0]` will be incremented by 1.

Since the loop runs `n-1` times, `a[-1]` will eventually reach -1 (if `(-1) ** i` equals -1 for all odd `i` up to `n-1`) or `a[0]` will reach `n` (if `(-1) ** i` equals 1 for all even `i` up to `n-1`). In either case, once `a[-1]` reaches -1 or `a[0]` reaches `n`, the loop will stop appending new elements to `answer`.

Therefore, `answer` will contain the first `n-1` elements of `array`, depending on whether `(-1) ** i` equals -1 or 1 for each iteration. If `(-1) ** i` equals -1 for more iterations, the elements from the end of `array` will be included; otherwise, the elements from the beginning of `array` will be included.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The final state of `answer` will contain elements from the `array` based on the conditions specified in the loop. Specifically, for each iteration `i` from 1 to `n-1`:

1. If `(-1)

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows: `k` is the input value of `k` decremented by the total number of iterations, `n` must be greater than the number of iterations, `array` is a list containing numbers from 1 to `n`, `answer` is a list containing all numbers from 1 to `n`, and `a` is a list containing either [2, -1] or [3, -1] depending on the parity of the number of iterations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
