Output State: **`answer` has the value it had before plus the element `array[a[0]]`, and `a[0]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `a[0] += 1` increments the value of `a[0]` by 1. The initial state mentions that `answer` has the value it had before plus the element `array[a[0]]`. After executing the code, `a[0]` is increased by 1, but the exact value of `answer` remains unchanged from its previous state because the addition to `answer` would occur after this line of code. Therefore, the updated state includes the increment of `a[0]` by 1 while keeping the description of `answer` as it was before the increment.
