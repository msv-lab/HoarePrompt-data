Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `answer` contains the element at index 0 from `array`, and the element at index 0 of `array` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `a[0] += 1` increments the element at index 0 of the array `a` by 1. The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `answer`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, `i` remains 3, `n` must still be greater than 3, `answer` still contains the element at index 0 from `array`, and the element at index 0 of `array` is now increased by 1.
