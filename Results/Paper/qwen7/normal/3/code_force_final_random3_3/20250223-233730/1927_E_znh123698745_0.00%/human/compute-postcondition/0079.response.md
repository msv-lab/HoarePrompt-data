Output State: **`k` is the input value of `k` decremented by 1, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `array` is a list containing numbers from 1 to `n`, `answer` is a list containing the number 1 and 2, `a` is a list containing [2, -2]**.

Explanation: The code `a[-1] -= 1` decrements the last element of list `a` by 1. Initially, `a` was `[2, -1]`. After the operation, the last element `-1` is decremented by 1, resulting in `-2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
