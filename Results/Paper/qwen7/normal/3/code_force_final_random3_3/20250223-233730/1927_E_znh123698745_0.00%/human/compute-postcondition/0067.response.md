Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(1, n)` will start with `i` equal to 1 and continue as long as `i < n`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1 (since `i` starts at 1).

3. **Consider the current state of the variables**:
   - `k` is the input value of `k` decremented by 1.
   - `n` is the input value of `n`.
   - `array` is a list containing numbers from 1 to `n`.
   - `answer` is a list containing the number 1.
   - `a` is a list containing `[1, -1]`.

4. **Adjust the states of the relevant variables**:
   - Since the loop requires `n > 1` to execute at least once, we need to ensure `n` is greater than 1.
   - The variable `i` will start at 1, but this is determined by the loop itself and does not need to be explicitly adjusted.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`k` is the input value of k decremented by 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `array` is a list containing numbers from 1 to n, `answer` is a list containing the number 1, `a` is a list containing [1, -1]**
