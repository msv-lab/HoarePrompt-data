Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `answer` has an element appended from `array[a[-1]]`.**

Explanation: The code appends an element from `array[a[-1]]` to the list `answer`. However, the initial values or states of `array`, `a`, and `answer` are not provided. Therefore, the only change we can definitively state is that `answer` has had an element appended from `array[a[-1]]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
