Postcondition: `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 1. If `(-1) ** i` equals -1, then `array` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, and `answer` has the element `array[a[-1] - 1]` appended to it. Otherwise, `answer` contains the element at index 0 from `array`, and `array[0]` is incremented by 1.
