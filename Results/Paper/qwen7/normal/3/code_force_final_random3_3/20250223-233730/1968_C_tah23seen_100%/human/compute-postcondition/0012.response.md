Output State: `arr` is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, `ans` is a list of n elements where `ans[0]` is `ans[1] - arr[0]`, `ans[1]` is `ans[2] - arr[1]`, and so on until `ans[n-2]` is `ans[n-1] - arr[n-2]`, with all other elements in `ans` still being \(10^9\), `i` is now -1.

This means after the loop completes all its iterations, the `ans` list will have its first `n-1` elements updated based on the given formula, and the last element (`ans[n-1]`) remains unchanged as it has no corresponding `arr` value to subtract from it. The variable `i` will be set to -1 since the loop condition `i >= 0` will no longer be satisfied.
