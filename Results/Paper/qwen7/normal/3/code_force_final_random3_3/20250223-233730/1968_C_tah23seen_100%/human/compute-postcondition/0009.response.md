Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, `ans` is a list of n elements where each element is 10^9 except for `ans[i]` which is `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` for all 0 <= i < n-1, `ans[0]` is updated to `ans[1] - arr[0]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` for all 0 <= i < n-1. This means that the first element of `ans` (i.e., `ans[0]`) is specifically updated to `ans[1] - arr[0]`. The rest of the conditions and values of the variables remain unchanged.
