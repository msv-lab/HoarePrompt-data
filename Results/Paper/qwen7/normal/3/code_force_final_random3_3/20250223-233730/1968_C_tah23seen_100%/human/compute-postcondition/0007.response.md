Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, `ans` is a list of n elements where each element is 10^9 except for `ans[i]` which is `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` for all 0 <= i < n-1; `i` is decreased by 1.**

In this case, the variable `i` is decremented by 1, but no other variables are affected by the given code snippet. The conditions and values of the lists `arr` and `ans` remain unchanged from the initial state.
