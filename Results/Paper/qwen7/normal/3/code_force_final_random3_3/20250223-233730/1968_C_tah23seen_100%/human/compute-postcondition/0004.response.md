Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, `ans` is a list of n elements where each element is 10^9 except for `ans[i]` which is `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`, `i` is now `i - 1`.**

The value of `i` is decremented by 1, so `i` is now `i - 1`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
