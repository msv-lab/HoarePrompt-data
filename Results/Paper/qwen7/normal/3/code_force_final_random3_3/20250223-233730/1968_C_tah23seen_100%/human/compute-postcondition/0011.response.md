Output State: `arr` is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, `ans` is a list of n elements where `ans[0]` is `ans[1] - arr[0]`, `ans[1]` is `ans[2] - arr[1]`, ..., `ans[n-2]` is `ans[n-1] - arr[n-2]`, and `ans[n-1]` is still `10^9`, `i` is now -1.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `ans` list will have its first element calculated based on the difference between subsequent elements as dictated by the loop, while the last element remains `10^9`. The variable `i` will be decremented below 0, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
