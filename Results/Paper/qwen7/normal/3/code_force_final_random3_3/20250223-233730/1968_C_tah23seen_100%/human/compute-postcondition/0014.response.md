Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` of n-1 integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` where the first `n-1` elements are calculated using the formula `ans[i] = ans[i+1] - arr[i]` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n-2`, and the last element `ans[n-1]` remains unchanged. All elements except the first `n-1` are set to \(10^9\), and the variable `i` is set to `-1`.**
