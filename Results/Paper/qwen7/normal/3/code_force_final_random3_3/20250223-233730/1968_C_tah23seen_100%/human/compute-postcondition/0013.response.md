Output State: **The program returns a list `ans` of length `n` where the first `n-1` elements are calculated based on the formula `ans[i] = ans[i+1] - arr[i]` for `i` ranging from `0` to `n-2`, and the last element `ans[n-1]` remains unchanged as it is not involved in any subtraction. Additionally, all elements except the first `n-1` are set to \(10^9\), and the variable `i` is set to `-1`.**

This means the list `ans` will have its first `n-1` elements updated according to the given formula, and the rest of the elements will be \(10^9\). The variable `i` will be set to `-1` after the loop completes.
