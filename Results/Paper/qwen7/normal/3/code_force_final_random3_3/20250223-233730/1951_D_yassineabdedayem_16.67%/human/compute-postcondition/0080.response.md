Output State: **`Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `k` is `k - Min`**

Explanation: The variable `k` is updated to `k - Min`. The values of `Min`, `Max`, and `number` remain unchanged from their initial states. `Min` is defined as `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is defined as `max(int(n / k), k)`, and `number` is defined as `max(int(n / k), k)`. Therefore, the output state includes these unchanged definitions along with the updated value of `k`.
