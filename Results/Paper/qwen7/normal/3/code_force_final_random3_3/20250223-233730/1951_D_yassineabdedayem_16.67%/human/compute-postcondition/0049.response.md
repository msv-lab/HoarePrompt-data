Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `tab`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `tab` that have not been iterated over.

3. **Analyze the given states**:
   - `tab` is a list that must have at least one element.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `n` is 0 or less.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `rep` is 60.
   - `number` is the last value assigned to `number` before the loop ended.
   - `Min` is `min(n // k, k)` for the last iteration.
   - `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)` for the last iteration.

4. **Check the current state of `tab`**: Since `tab` must have at least one element, and no information suggests that `tab` has been modified or emptied during the loop, we assume `tab` still has at least one element.

5. **Determine the next state**:
   - `i` will be the first element of `tab` since it is the first iteration of the loop.
   - `tab` will be the remaining elements of `tab` after removing the first element.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` will be the first element of `tab`.
- `tab` will be the remaining elements of `tab`.

Since `tab` must have at least one element, the loop can continue. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the first element of `tab` being assigned to `i` and `tab` being updated to the remaining elements.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is the first element of `tab`, `tab` is the list of remaining elements from `tab`**
