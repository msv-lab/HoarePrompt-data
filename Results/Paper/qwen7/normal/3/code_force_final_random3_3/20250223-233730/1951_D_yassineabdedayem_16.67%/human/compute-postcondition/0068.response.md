Output State: **`n` must be non-zero, `k` must be positive, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, and either `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`; `number` is `max(int(n / k), k)`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `Max` (which is `max(int(n / k), k)`) to the variable `number`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
