Output State: **`n` must be non-zero, `k` is `k - Max`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `Min`**.

Explanation: The value of `k` is updated to `k - Max`. The values of `Min`, `Max`, and `number` remain unchanged because they are dependent on the initial values of `n` and `k`, which are not altered by the code. The precondition that `n` must be non-zero and `k` must be positive remains valid.
