Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an integer read from standard input and `n` is not zero, `k` is a positive integer read from standard input, `rep` is 1, `number` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, and `k` is reduced by `Min`.**

Explanation: The code `k = k - Min` subtracts the value of `Min` (which is `min(n // k, k)`) from `k`. All other variables remain unchanged.
