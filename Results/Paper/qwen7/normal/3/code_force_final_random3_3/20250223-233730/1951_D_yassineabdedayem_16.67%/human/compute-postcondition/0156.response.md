Postcondition: **`total` is 0, `students` is 2 less than its initial value, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k` for the final iteration, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k` for the final iteration, `number` is either `Min` if `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `number` is `Max` for the final iteration, `k` is adjusted to `k - Max` if `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `k` is adjusted to `k - Min` for the final iteration, `rep` is 60, `n` is 0, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` for each iteration, and the condition `k == 0` is true.**
