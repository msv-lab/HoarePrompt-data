Output State: **`rep` is 0, `k` is adjusted according to the loop's conditions, `tab` contains the sequence of numbers generated during the loop's execution, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)` for the last iteration, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)` for the last iteration, `i` is the last element of `tab`, `t` is decreased by 1 (t-1)**.

Explanation: The line `rep = 0` sets the variable `rep` to 0. All other variables (`k`, `tab`, `Min`, `Max`, `i`, and `t`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
