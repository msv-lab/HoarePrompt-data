Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an integer read from standard input and `n` is not zero, `k` is a positive integer read from standard input, `rep` is 0, `number` is `min(n // k, k)`, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, and the current value of `Max` is equal to `k - max(int(n / k), k)` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k - max(int(n / k), k)`**.

Explanation: The code `k = k - Max` updates the value of `k` by subtracting `Max` from its current value. Since `Max` is defined as `max(int(n / k), k)`, the new value of `k` becomes `k - max(int(n / k), k)`. All other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
