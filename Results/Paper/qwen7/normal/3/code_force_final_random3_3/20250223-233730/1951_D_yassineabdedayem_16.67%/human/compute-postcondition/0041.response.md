Output State: **`rep` is 3, `k` is adjusted based on the condition `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`. If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k` holds true, then `k` is reduced by `Max`. Otherwise, `k` is reduced by `Min`. `Min` remains as `min(n // k, k)`, and `Max` remains as `max(int(n / k), k)`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `n` is decreased by `Min * Max`.**

Explanation: The code `rep += 1` increments the value of `rep` by 1. Since the initial value of `rep` was 2, after executing this line, `rep` becomes 3. The values of `k`, `Min`, `Max`, `tab`, and `n` remain unchanged as no operation affecting these variables is performed.
