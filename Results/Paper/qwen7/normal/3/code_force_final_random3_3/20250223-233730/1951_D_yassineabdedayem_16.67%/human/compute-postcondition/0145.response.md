Output State: **`total` is 0, `students` is 2 less than its initial value, `Min` is n // k if n // k <= k else k, `Max` is int(n / k) if int(n / k) >= k else k, `number` is `Min`, `k` is adjusted based on whether Max equals k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, `rep` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to k and not zero.**

Explanation: The code `number = Min` simply assigns the value of `Min` to `number`. This does not affect the values of `total`, `students`, `Max`, `k`, `rep`, or `n`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged except for `number`, which is now equal to `Min`.
