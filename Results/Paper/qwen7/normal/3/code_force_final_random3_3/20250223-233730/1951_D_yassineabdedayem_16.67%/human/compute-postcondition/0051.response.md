Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the list `tab`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements in the list `tab`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is the first element of `tab`.
   - `tab` is the list of remaining elements from `tab`.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - After the first iteration, `i` will be the first element of `tab`.
   - Since `i` is now consumed, `tab` will be updated to exclude this first element.

5. **New State**:
   - `i` will be the second element of the original `tab` (since it was the first element in the previous iteration).
   - `tab` will be the list of remaining elements from the original `tab`, excluding the first element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is the second element of `tab`, `tab` is the list of remaining elements from `tab`**
