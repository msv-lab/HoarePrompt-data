Output State: **`total` is 0, `students` is 2 less than its initial value, `Min` is n // k if n // k <= k else k, `Max` is int(n / k) if int(n / k) >= k else k, `number` is either `Min` if `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `number` is `Max`, `k` is adjusted to `k - Max` if `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `k` is adjusted to `k - Min`, `rep` is 3, `n` is n - Min * Max, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`.**

Explanation: The code `rep += 1` increments the value of `rep` by 1. Initially, `rep` was 2, so now it is 3. The values of other variables remain unchanged as no operations were performed on them in this line of code.
