Output State: **`total` is 0, `students` is 2 less than its initial value, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `n` must be greater than 0, `number` is either `min((n // k) - (k), k)` or `max(int(n / k), k)` depending on the conditions, `k` must be greater than 0, `rep` is 1, `Min` is reassigned to `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is reassigned to `max(int(n / k), k)`**

Explanation: The code reassigns the values of `Min` and `Max` to their respective expressions. Since these expressions are derived from the same variables `n` and `k`, the values of `Min` and `Max` are updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged.
