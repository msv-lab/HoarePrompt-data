Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an integer read from standard input and `n` is not zero, `k` is a positive integer read from standard input, `rep` is 0, `number` is `min(n // k, k)`, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, and the current value of `Max` is equal to `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation: The line `number = Min` assigns the value of `Min` to `number`. Since `Min` is defined as `min(n // k, k)`, `number` now holds this value. All other variables remain unchanged.
