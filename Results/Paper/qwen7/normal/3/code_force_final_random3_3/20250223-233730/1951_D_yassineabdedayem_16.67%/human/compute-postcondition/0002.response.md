Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, `n` is an integer read from standard input, `k` is an integer read from standard input.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from standard input using `stdin.readline().split()` and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
