Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an integer read from standard input and `n` is not zero, `k` is a positive integer read from standard input, `rep` is 1, `number` is either `min(n // k, k)` or `max(int(n / k), k)`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` appended to the previous elements, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, and `k` is adjusted to `k - max(int(n / k), k)` if `Max == k and n * Min <= k`, otherwise `k` is reduced by `Min`.**

Explanation: The code appends the string representation of the variable `number` to the list `tab`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `Min`, `Max`, and the adjustment of `k` remain unchanged. The list `tab` now contains the string representation of `number` added to its previous elements.
