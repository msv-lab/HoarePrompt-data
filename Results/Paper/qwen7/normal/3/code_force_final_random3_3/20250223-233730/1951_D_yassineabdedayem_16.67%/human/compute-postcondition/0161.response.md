Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in tab:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `tab`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, `tab` must contain at least one element. This means that `tab` should not be empty.

3. **Determine the State After the Previous Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `tab` must contain at least one element (the string representation of `number`).

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `tab` must still contain at least one element.
   - The variable `i` will be set to the first element of `tab` in the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `tab` still contains at least one element, and `i` will be set to the first element of `tab`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`tab` must contain at least one element, and `i` will be set to the first element of `tab`**.
