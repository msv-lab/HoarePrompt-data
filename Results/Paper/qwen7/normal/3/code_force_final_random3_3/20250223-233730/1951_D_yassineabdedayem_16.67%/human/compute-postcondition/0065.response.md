Output State: **`n` must be non-zero, `k` must be positive, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `Min`**.

Explanation: The variable `number` is assigned the value of `Min`. Since `Min` is defined as `min(n // k, k)` and `Max` is initially equal to `k`, the value of `Min` cannot be greater than `k`. Also, given that the product of `n` and `Min` is less than or equal to `k`, `Min` must be a value that satisfies this condition. The output state includes all the preconditions and the new assignment for `number`.
