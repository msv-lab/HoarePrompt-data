Output State: **`total` is 0, `students` is 2 less than its initial value, `Min` is n // k if n // k <= k else k, `Max` is int(n / k) if int(n / k) >= k else k, `number` is either min(n // (k - Max), k - Max) or max(int(n / k), k) depending on the conditions, `k` is adjusted based on whether Max equals k and n * Min is less than or equal to k, `rep` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to k and not zero.**

Explanation: The code calculates `Min` and `Max` based on the values of `n` and `k`. Specifically, `Min` is set to the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, and `Max` is set to the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, except for the updated definitions of `Min` and `Max`.
