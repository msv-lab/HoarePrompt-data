Output State: **`total` is 0, `students` is 2 less than its initial value, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `k` is `k - min(n // k, k)`, `rep` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `k = k - Min` updates the value of `k` by subtracting `Min` from it. Since `Min` is defined as `min(n // k, k)`, `k` is updated to `k - min(n // k, k)`. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.
