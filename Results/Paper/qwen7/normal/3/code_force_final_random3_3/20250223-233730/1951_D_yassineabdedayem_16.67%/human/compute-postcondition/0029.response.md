Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n` is an integer read from standard input and `n` is not zero, `k` is a positive integer read from standard input, `rep` is 1, `number` is either `min(n // k, k)` or `max(int(n / k), k)`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` appended to the previous elements, `Min` is `min(n // k, k) - Min * Max`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k) - Min * Max`, and `k` is adjusted to `k - max(int(n / k), k)` if `Max == k and n * Min <= k`, otherwise `k` is reduced by `Min`.**

Explanation:
- The code `n -= Min * Max` subtracts `Min * Max` from `n`.
- The values of `Min` and `Max` are updated to `Min - Min * Max` and `Max - Min * Max`, respectively.
- The value of `k` is adjusted based on the condition given, but since the exact value of `k` before the adjustment is not specified, we keep it as `k - max(int(n / k), k)` if `Max == k and n * Min <= k`, otherwise `k` is reduced by `Min`.
