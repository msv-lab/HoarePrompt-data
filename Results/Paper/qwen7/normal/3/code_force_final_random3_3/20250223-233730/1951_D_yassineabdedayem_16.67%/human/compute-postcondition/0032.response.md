Output State: **`rep` is 2, `k` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `n`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `Min` and `Max` based on the values of `n` and `k`. Since `k` must be greater than 0 and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, `Min` will be the minimum value between `n // k` and `k`, and `Max` will be the maximum value between `int(n / k)` and `k`. The initial value of `rep` remains unchanged.
