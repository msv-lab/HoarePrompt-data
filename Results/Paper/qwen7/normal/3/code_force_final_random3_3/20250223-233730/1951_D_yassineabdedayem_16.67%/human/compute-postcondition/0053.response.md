Output State: **`i` is the last element of `tab`, `tab` is an empty list.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element in the list `tab`.
- After each iteration, the current element `i` is printed, and the element is removed from `tab`.
- Since the loop runs until `tab` is empty, after all iterations, `i` will be the last element that was in `tab`, and `tab` itself will be an empty list.

This means that after the loop completes, `tab` will no longer contain any elements, and `i` will hold the last value that was printed, which is the last element of the original `tab`.
