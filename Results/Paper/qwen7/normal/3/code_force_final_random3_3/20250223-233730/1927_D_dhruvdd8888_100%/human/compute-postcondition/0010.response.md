Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `N` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6], `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers with an additional element `-1` appended to it, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is the first element of `nums`, `arr` is a list containing one tuple `(1, i, num)`, `i` is 2, `N` must be greater than or equal to 0, and the current value of `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`.**

This output state reflects that the tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` has been appended to the list `arr`, where `s` was initially 0, `i` was 1, and `num` is the first element of `nums`. After appending, `i` is updated to 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
