Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Defining Functions:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`tc`).
   - It defines a function `func_1()` which processes each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - Inside `func_1()`, the program reads the size of the array `N`.
   - It reads the array `nums` and appends `-1` to handle the last segment.
   - It iterates through the array to identify segments where the value changes and stores these segments in `arr`.

3. **Identifying Segments:**
   - The loop identifies segments where the value changes and appends tuples `(start_index, end_index, value)` to `arr`.
   - This ensures that `arr` contains all segments of consecutive identical numbers.

4. **Handling Queries:**
   - For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the relevant segment in `arr`.
   - Based on the position of the segment relative to the query range `[l, r]`, it determines whether there are two distinct indices within the range.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Segment Identification:**
   - The logic to identify segments where the value changes is correct. However, the handling of the last element (appending `-1`) is unnecessary since the loop naturally handles the last segment.

2. **Query Handling:**
   - The use of binary search to find the relevant segment is appropriate.
   - The conditions to check if the segment lies within the query range and to determine the output are mostly correct but can be simplified.

### Potential Issues

1. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program should handle edge cases where the entire segment is within the query range without needing further checks.
   - The logic for determining the output when no distinct elements are found could be more straightforward.

2. **Simplification:**
   - The current implementation has some redundant checks and can be simplified.

### Corrected Implementation

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from bisect import bisect_left

def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    arr = []
    prev_num = nums[0]
    start = 0
    
    # Identify segments where the value changes
    for i in range(N):
        if nums[i] != prev_num:
            arr.append((start, i, prev_num))
            start = i
        prev_num = nums[i]
    
    # Append the last segment
    arr.append((start, N, prev_num))
    
    LA = len(arr) - 1
    
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (l, r) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        
        if eli == LA and arr[eli][1] < r:
            print(-1, -1)
        else:
            (s, e, _) = arr[eli]
            if s <= l and e >= r:
                print(-1, -1)
            elif s < l and e >= r:
                print(l, l + 1)
            elif s <= l and e < r:
                print(s, e + 1)
            else:
                print(-1, -1)

# Main loop for test cases
tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()
```

### Conclusion

After reviewing and simplifying the code, the program appears to handle the problem correctly. Therefore, the original program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
