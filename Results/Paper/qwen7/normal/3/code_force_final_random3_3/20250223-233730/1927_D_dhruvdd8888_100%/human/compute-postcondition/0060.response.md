Postcondition: `s` is assigned the value of 1 or a value greater than `r`, `e` is assigned the value of the third element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, and `n` remains a positive integer inputted initially. `eli` is the index of the leftmost occurrence of the tuple (l, 0, 0) in the list `arr`. If `s` is greater than `l`, then `s` is either 1 or a value greater than `r`. If `s` is not greater than `l`, then `s` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` and is less than or equal to `l`. In both cases, `e` will either remain unchanged (if `e` is less than `N` or `l`) or be greater than or equal to `r`.
