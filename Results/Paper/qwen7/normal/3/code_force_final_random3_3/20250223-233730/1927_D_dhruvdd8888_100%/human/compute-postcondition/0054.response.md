Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is assigned the value of the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
- `e` is assigned the value of the third element of the same tuple.
- `n` remains a positive integer inputted initially.
- `s` is less than or equal to `l`.
- `e` is greater than or equal to `r`.

The `print(-1, -1)` statement simply outputs the values `-1` and `-1` regardless of the values of `s`, `e`, `n`, `l`, and `r`.

Output: **-1, -1**
