Output State: **All iterations of the loop have been executed. The variable `n` remains a positive integer as initially inputted. The variable `s` is the first element of the tuple at the index found by `bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))` in `arr`, and `e` is the third element of the same tuple. The variable `eli` is the index found by `bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))`. The variables `l` and `r` are updated to the values of the integers inputted via `input().split()` and converted to integers using `map(int)` at each iteration.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop have completed, the value of `n` remains unchanged from its initial value. The values of `s` and `e` are determined based on the binary search result and the tuple in `arr` that corresponds to the search result. The variable `eli` reflects the latest search result. The values of `l` and `r` are updated at the start of each iteration to reflect the new input values.
