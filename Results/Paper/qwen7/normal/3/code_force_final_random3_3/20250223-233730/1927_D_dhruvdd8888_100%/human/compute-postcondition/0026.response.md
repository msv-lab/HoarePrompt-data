Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `N` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6], `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers with an additional element -1 appended to it, `s` is `N + 1`, `e` is 0, `num` is the value of `nums[N]`, `arr` is a list containing up to `N` tuples, each of the form `(1 + i, i, num_i)` where `num_i` is the value of `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`, and `i` ranges from 2 to `N`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the variable `s` will be set to `N + 1` because the loop increments `s` on every iteration until it reaches `N`. The variable `num` will be the last element of `nums`, which is `nums[N]`. The list `arr` will contain all the positions where the elements in `nums` change, starting from index 2 up to `N`, capturing the transitions where `nums[i]` is different from `nums[i-1]`.
