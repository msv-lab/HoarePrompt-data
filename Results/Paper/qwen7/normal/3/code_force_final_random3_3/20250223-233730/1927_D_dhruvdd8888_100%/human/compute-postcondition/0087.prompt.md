Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, `N` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6], `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers with an additional element -1 appended to it, `s` is `N + 1`, `e` is 0, `num` is the value of `nums[N]`, `arr` is a list containing up to `N` tuples, each of the form `(1 + i, i, num_i)` where `num_i` is the value of `nums[i]` if `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`, and `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
    s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
    if s > l:
        if s == 1 or s > r:
            print(-1, -1)
        else:
            print(s - 1, s)
    elif e >= r:
        print(-1, -1)
    elif e < N or e < l:
        print(s, e + 1)
    else:
        print(-1, -1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `s` is assigned the value of 1 or a value greater than `r`, `e` is assigned the value of the third element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, and `n` remains a positive integer inputted initially. `eli` is the index of the leftmost occurrence of the tuple (l, 0, 0) in the list `arr`. If `s` is greater than `l`, then `s` is either 1 or a value greater than `r`. If `s` is not greater than `l`, then `s` is the second element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` and is less than or equal to `l`. In both cases, `e` will either remain unchanged (if `e` is less than `N` or `l`) or be greater than or equal to `r`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is assigned the value of the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` and remains 1 or a value greater than `r`; `e` is assigned the value of the third element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` and remains the third element of the tuple; `n` remains a positive integer inputted initially; `eli` is updated to the index found by `bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))`; `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`, `e` is the third element of the same tuple, `n` is a positive integer inputted initially, `eli` is updated to the index found by `bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))`, `l` and `r` are assigned the values of two integers inputted via `input().split()` and converted to integers using `map(int)`, and the number of remaining iterations is reduced by 1. This holds true whether `s > l` or not.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
