Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
   - `e` is the third element of the same tuple.
   - `n` is a positive integer inputted initially.
   - `eli` is updated to the index found by `bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))`.
   - `l` and `r` are assigned the values of two integers inputted via `input().split()` and converted to integers using `map(int)`.
   - The number of remaining iterations is reduced by 1.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement `print(s, e + 1)` will print the value of `s` followed by `e + 1`.

To determine the exact values of `s` and `e`, we need to know the structure of the `arr` list and the values of `l` and `LA`. However, since these details are not provided, we can only describe the values in terms of the given information.

- `s` is the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr`.
- `e` is the third element of the same tuple.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **s, e + 1 (where s is the first element and e is the third element of the tuple at index min(eli, LA) in arr)**
