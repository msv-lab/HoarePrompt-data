Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where all elements within the queried range are the same. For example, consider the following input:

```
5
1 1 1 1 1
1
1 5
```

The program will output `-1 -1` because it does not find a pair of different elements within the range `[1, 5]`. However, according to the problem description, we should find a pair of different elements if they exist. Since the program does not handle this case correctly, the correctness is `False`.
