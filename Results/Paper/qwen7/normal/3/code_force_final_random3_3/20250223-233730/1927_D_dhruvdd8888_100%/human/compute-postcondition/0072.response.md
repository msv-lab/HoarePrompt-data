Postcondition: **`s` is assigned the value of the first element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` and remains 1 or a value greater than `r`; `e` is assigned the value of the third element of the tuple at index `min(eli, LA)` in `arr` and remains the third element of the tuple; `n` remains a positive integer inputted initially; `eli` is updated to the index found by `bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))`; `l` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer.**
