Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `N` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6], `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers with an additional element -1 appended to it, `s` is 3, `e` is 0, `num` is the value of `nums[3]`, `arr` is a list containing two tuples [(3, 4, num), (1 + s, i, num)] if `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`, and `i` is 4.**

Explanation: The code appends a new tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` to the list `arr`. Given that `s` is 3 and `i` is 4, the new tuple added to `arr` is `(1 + 3, 4, num)`, which simplifies to `(4, 4, num)`. Since `arr` initially contained one tuple `(3, i, num)` if `nums[i]` was not equal to `num`, after appending the new tuple, `arr` now contains two tuples: `(3, 4, num)` and `(4, 4, num)`.
