Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string according to the problem description. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not properly establish the mapping between characters in the encoded string and their corresponding characters in the auxiliary string `r`. Instead of finding the symmetric character in `r`, the function simply assigns the next available character in alphabetical order, which leads to incorrect results.

For example, consider the encoded string `"serofedsoc"`. According to the problem description, the auxiliary string `r` should be `"cdefors"`. The correct decoding process would map:
- 's' to 'c'
- 'e' to 'o'
- 'r' to 'f'
- 'o' to 'd'
- 'f' to 'e'
- 'd' to 'r'
- 's' to 'c'

However, the current implementation does not maintain this mapping correctly. For instance, after assigning 's' to 'c', the next character 'e' is incorrectly mapped to 't' instead of 'o'. This discrepancy can be observed in the output for the test case `"serofedsoc"`, which should produce `"codeforces"` but produces an incorrect result due to the flawed mapping logic.
