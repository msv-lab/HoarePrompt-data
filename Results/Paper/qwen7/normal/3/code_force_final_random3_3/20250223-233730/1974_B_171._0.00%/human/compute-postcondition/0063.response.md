Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `c` will be 122, which is the ASCII value for 'z'. `char` will be the next character in `encoded`. `decoded` will contain all characters from 'a' to 'z' and the additional character 'z', with each character having its corresponding decoded value in `mapping`.**

This means that after the loop completes all 26 iterations (from 'a' to 'z'), `c` will have reached its maximum value of 122 ('z'). The variable `char` will hold the next character in `encoded` (if there is any left), but since the loop condition checks up to 'z', `char` will not be used further in the loop. The dictionary `mapping` will map each character from 'a' to 'z' to the corresponding `char` encountered during the loop, ensuring that `decoded` can decode these characters correctly.
