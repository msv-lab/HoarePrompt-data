You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

                    break

    return ''.join(decoded)



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a specific string "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzz". It decodes the input string according to a custom mapping rule where each unique character in `encoded` is mapped to a lowercase letter from 'a' to 'z', ensuring each letter appears exactly once in the output. If a character repeats in `encoded`, it is mapped to the last occurrence. After processing, the function appends an extra 'z' to the decoded string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string according to the problem description. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not properly establish the mapping between characters in the encoded string and their corresponding characters in the auxiliary string `r`. Instead of finding the symmetric character in `r`, the function simply assigns the next available character in alphabetical order, which leads to incorrect results.

For example, consider the encoded string `"serofedsoc"`. According to the problem description, the auxiliary string `r` should be `"cdefors"`. The correct decoding process would map:
- 's' to 'c'
- 'e' to 'o'
- 'r' to 'f'
- 'o' to 'd'
- 'f' to 'e'
- 'd' to 'r'
- 's' to 'c'

However, the current implementation does not maintain this mapping correctly. For instance, after assigning 's' to 'c', the next character 'e' is incorrectly mapped to 't' instead of 'o'. This discrepancy can be observed in the output for the test case `"serofedsoc"`, which should produce `"codeforces"` but produces an incorrect result due to the flawed mapping logic.
