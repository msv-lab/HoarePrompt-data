Output State: **`decoded` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' and an additional 'z', with each character having its corresponding decoded value in `mapping`; `c` is 122, which is the ASCII value for 'z'; `char` is the next character in `encoded`.**

Explanation: The code appends the character corresponding to the ASCII value 122 (which is 'z') to the list `decoded`. Since `c` is 122, it remains unchanged. The variable `char` is mentioned to be the next character in `encoded`, indicating that the loop or process is continuing to the next character after appending 'z'.
