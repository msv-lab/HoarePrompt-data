Output State: **`c` is 99, the dictionary `mapping` now contains the key `'c'` mapped to the value `char` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables `c` or the dictionary `mapping`. It only indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside, which in this case, was not specified. Therefore, the values remain unchanged.
