Output State: **`char` is the next character in `encoded`, `decoded` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' and the additional character 'z', `c` is 98, and the current value of `chr(c)` is in `mapping.values()` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables; it only exits the loop or conditional block it is inside. Therefore, the values of `char`, `decoded`, `c`, and the condition involving `chr(c)` remain unchanged. We also note that the break statement indicates we exit the most internal loop or if statement.
