Output State: **`c` must be within the range 99 to 124 (inclusive), `char` is the next character in `encoded`, and `decoded` remains unchanged unless `chr(c)` is not in `mapping.values()`, `mapping[chr(c)]` is now equal to `char`**.

This means that the character corresponding to the ASCII value `c` (which is within the specified range) has been mapped to `char`. The other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
