Output State: **`c` is 97; `chr(c)` is mapped to `char` in `mapping`; `mapping` is a dictionary with one more entry.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not affect any variable values or the structure of the dictionary. It only indicates that we exit the current loop or block of code. Therefore, the values of `c`, `chr(c)`, and the state of the `mapping` dictionary remain unchanged.
