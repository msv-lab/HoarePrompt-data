Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `char` is the next character in `encoded`, `decoded` either has one more element than before with the last element being the decoded value corresponding to `char` in `mapping`, or `decoded` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' and the additional character 'z', `c` is 122
Code of the loop:
for c in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
    if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
        mapping[chr(c)] = char
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `char` is the next character in `encoded`, `decoded` either has one more element than before with the last element being the decoded value corresponding to `char` in `mapping`, or `decoded` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' and the additional character 'z'. If `chr(c)` (where `c` is 97) is not in `mapping.values()`, then `decoded` is updated to include the decoded value corresponding to `char`. If `chr(c)` (where `c` is 98) is in `mapping.values()`, then no change is made to `decoded`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `c` is 98, `char` is the next character in `encoded`. If `chr(97)` is not in `mapping.values()`, then `decoded` is updated to include the decoded value corresponding to `char`. If `chr(98)` is already in `mapping.values()`, then `decoded` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `c` is 99 and `char` is the next character in `encoded`. If `chr(c)` is not in the values of `mapping`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
