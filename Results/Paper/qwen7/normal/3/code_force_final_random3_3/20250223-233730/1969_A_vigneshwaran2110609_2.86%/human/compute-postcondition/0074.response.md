Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through a list of test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers each ranging from 1 to `n` excluding the index position. For each test case, the function returns either an error message if any condition is violated or a specific output based on the given inputs.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters, and returns an appropriate output or error message based on the validity and constraints of those parameters.
