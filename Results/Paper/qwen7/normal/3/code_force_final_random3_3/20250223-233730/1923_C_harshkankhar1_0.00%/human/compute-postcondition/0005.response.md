Output State: **`i` is 1; `x` is 2; `b[1]` is 2**

Explanation: The code `b[i] = b[i - 1] + x` updates the list `b` such that the element at index `i` is set to the sum of the element at index `i-1` and `x`. Given that `i` is 1 and `x` is 2, `b[1]` is calculated as `b[0] + 2`. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `b[0]`, we cannot determine its exact value, but we know that `b[1]` is now `2`. The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged.
