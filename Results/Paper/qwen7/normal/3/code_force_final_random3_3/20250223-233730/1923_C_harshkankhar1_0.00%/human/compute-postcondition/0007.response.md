Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `x` is 1**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value 1 to `x` because the condition `a[i] > 1` is not specified and thus defaults to `else 2`. However, since `a[i]` is not defined in the initial state, the `else` part is taken, making `x` equal to 1. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged as no operations were performed on them.
