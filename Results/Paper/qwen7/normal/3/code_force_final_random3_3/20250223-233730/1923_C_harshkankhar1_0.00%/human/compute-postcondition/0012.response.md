Output State: `i` is equal to `n`; `x` is 1 if `a[n]` is greater than 1, otherwise 2; `b[n]` is the sum of all `x` values calculated during the loop iterations.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`. The value of `x` depends on whether `a[i]` (which becomes `a[n]` at the last iteration) is greater than 1 or not. If it is, `x` is 1; otherwise, `x` is 2. The variable `b[n]` accumulates the sum of all `x` values from the first iteration to the last, which means `b[n]` will be the total count of times `x` was set to 1 plus the number of times it was set to 2.
