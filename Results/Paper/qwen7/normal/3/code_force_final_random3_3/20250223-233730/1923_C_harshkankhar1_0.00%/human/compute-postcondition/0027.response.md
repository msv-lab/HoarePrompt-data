Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases internally. For each test case, it accepts two positive integers `n` and `q`, a list `c` of `n` positive integers, and `q` pairs of integers `l_i` and `r_i`. It returns a result for each query indicating the count of distinct elements in the subarray defined by `c[l_i]` to `c[r_i]` inclusive.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing an array of integers and a set of queries. For each query, it calculates and returns the number of unique elements within the specified subarray range.
