You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer; for each test case, n and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5; c is a list of n positive integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive; for each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `x` will be 1 (since `a[i]` will always be greater than 1 for `i >= 2`), and `b[n]` will be `b[n-1] + 1`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be the same as the value of `n`, `x` will always be 1 because `a[i]` starts from the second element of the list `a` which is guaranteed to be greater than 1, and `b[n]` will be the sum of all `x` values, which is essentially `n`.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    print(*a)
    #This is printed: [accumulated sum of the original list a]
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `q` will be equal to 0, `x` and `y` will be the last integers entered by the user for each iteration, and the program will print either 'NO' or 'YES' based on the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of positive integers and a set of queries. For each query, it compares the sum of elements in a specified subarray with a calculated value and prints 'YES' if the sum of elements is less than or equal to the calculated value, or 'NO' otherwise. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each query.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a subarray is good according to the problem description. Specifically, the program does not check whether there exists an array \(b\) that satisfies the conditions mentioned in the problem statement. Instead, it seems to be performing some accumulation operations which are not relevant to the problem.

To illustrate, consider the following subarray from the example input: `c = [1, 2, 1, 4, 5]` and the query for the subarray from index 1 to 3 (`l=1`, `r=3`). The subarray is `[1, 2, 1]`. According to the problem, for this subarray to be good, there must exist an array \(b\) such that:

1. \(\sum_{i=1}^{3} b_i = \sum_{i=1}^{3} [1, 2, 1] = 4\).
2. \(b_i > 0\) for every index \(i\).
3. \(b_i \neq 1, 2, 1\).

One possible valid \(b\) could be `[2, 3, 2]` since \(\sum_{i=1}^{3} [2, 3, 2] = 7 - 3 = 4\) and it satisfies the other conditions. However, the program does not check for such a possibility and simply prints 'NO' for all queries, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the required logic and hence is incorrect.
