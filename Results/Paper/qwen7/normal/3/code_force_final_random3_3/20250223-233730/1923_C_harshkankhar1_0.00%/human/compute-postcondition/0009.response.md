Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 2
   - `x` is 1 (This variable is not in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted)
   - `b[2]` is `b[1] + 1` (This is an array element and not a loop head variable, so it does not need to be adjusted)

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n + 1` (inclusive). Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i < n + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, `i` will be incremented to 3 in the next iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `n + 1`. Given that `i` is now 3, `n` must be at least 2 (since `i` starts from 1).

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `n` must still be greater than or equal to 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
