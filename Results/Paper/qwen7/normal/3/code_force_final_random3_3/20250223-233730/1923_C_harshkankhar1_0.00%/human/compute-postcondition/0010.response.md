Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `x` is 1**

Explanation: The code `x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2` checks the condition `a[i] > 1`. Since `i` is 3 and there is no information about the value of `a[3]`, we cannot determine the exact value of `x`. However, based on the given options (1 or 2), if `a[3]` is greater than 1, `x` would be 1; otherwise, `x` would be 2. Given the initial state, the only thing we can definitively say is that `x` is set to 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
