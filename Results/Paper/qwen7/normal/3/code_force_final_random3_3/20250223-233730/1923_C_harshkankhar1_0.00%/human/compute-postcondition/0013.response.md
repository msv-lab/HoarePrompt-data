Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `x` will be 1 (since `a[i]` will always be greater than 1 for `i >= 2`), and `b[n]` will be `b[n-1] + 1`.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be the same as the value of `n`, `x` will always be 1 because `a[i]` starts from the second element of the list `a` which is guaranteed to be greater than 1, and `b[n]` will be the sum of all `x` values, which is essentially `n`.
