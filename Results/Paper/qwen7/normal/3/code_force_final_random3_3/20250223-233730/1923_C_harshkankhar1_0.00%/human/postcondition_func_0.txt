The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of positive integers and a set of queries. For each query, it compares the sum of elements in a specified subarray with a calculated value and prints 'YES' if the sum of elements is less than or equal to the calculated value, or 'NO' otherwise. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each query.
