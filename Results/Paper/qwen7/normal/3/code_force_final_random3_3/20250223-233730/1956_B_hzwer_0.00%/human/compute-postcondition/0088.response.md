Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is either 0 or 1.
- `j` is `n-2`.
- `dp[i][j]` is updated based on specific conditions.
- `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
- The `cards` list also remains unchanged.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over `j` in reverse order from `n-1` to `-1`.
- The loop variable `j` is being decremented by 1 in each iteration.

### Current State:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `n-2`.

### Next Iteration:
- Since the loop decrements `j` by 1, the new value of `j` will be `n-3`.

### Adjusting the States:
- `i` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop head.
- `j` changes to `n-3`.
- `dp[i][j]` will be updated based on the new value of `j`.
- `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
- The `cards` list remains unchanged.

### Final State:
- `i` is either 0 or 1.
- `j` is `n-3`.
- `dp[i][j]` is updated based on the new value of `j`.
- `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
- The `cards` list remains unchanged.

### Answer:
State: **`i` is either 0 or 1; `j` is `n-3`; `dp[i][j]` is updated based on the new value of `j`; `t` and `n` remain unchanged; the `cards` list also remains unchanged.**

So, the final state is:
State: **`i` is either 0 or 1; `j` is `n-3`; `dp[i][j]` is updated based on the new value of `j`; `t` and `n` remain unchanged; the `cards` list also remains unchanged.**
