Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs in reverse order from `n-1` to `0`. The loop continues as long as `j` is greater than or equal to `0`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `n-3`
   - `j` is `n-2`
   - `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` filled with zeros except for `dp[n-1][0]` and `dp[n-2][0]` which are 0
   - `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`
   - `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5`
   - `cards` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers
   - `dp[i][j]` is updated based on certain conditions involving `cards`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is decrementing `j` by 1 each time, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `n-2`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decremented by 1, making it `n-3`.
   - Therefore, `j` should be set to `n-3`.

5. **Other variables remain unchanged**:
   - `i` remains `n-3`
   - `dp` remains a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` filled with zeros except for `dp[n-1][0]` and `dp[n-2][0]` which are 0
   - `t` remains an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`
   - `n` remains an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5`
   - `cards` remains a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is `n-3`, `j` is `n-3`, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` filled with zeros except for `dp[n-1][0]` and `dp[n-2][0]` which are 0, `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5`, `cards` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers**
