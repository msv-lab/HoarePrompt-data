Postcondition: `i` is either 0 or 1; `j` is `n-2`; `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum value among `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1` and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]` if `cards.count(j + 1) != 0`; otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is set to `dp[i + 1][j]`; `t` and `n` remain unchanged; the `cards` list also remains unchanged.
