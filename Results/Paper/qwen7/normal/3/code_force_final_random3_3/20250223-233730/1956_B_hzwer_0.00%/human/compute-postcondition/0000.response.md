Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and `n` is the integer input from the user.**

This means that the variable `t` retains its original state (an integer between 1 and 10^4), and the variable `n` is assigned the value of the integer input from the user, which is an integer between 1 and 2 ⋅ 10^5.
