Output State: The variable `i` is 0, `j` is 0, the `dp` table is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` where each element has been updated to the maximum value it can take based on the conditions specified in the loop body. Specifically, for each cell `dp[i][j]`, it holds the maximum value determined by the conditions given in the loop body, considering the counts of each card value in the `cards` list. The `t` and `n` variables remain unchanged, with `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4` and `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5`. The `cards` list also remains unchanged, being a list of integers derived from the input.

This final state represents the complete execution of the loop where `i` starts from `n-3` and decreases to `0`, and `j` starts from `n-1` and decreases to `0`. The `dp` table is fully populated with the maximum values calculated according to the given conditions, providing the optimal solution for the problem defined by the loop.
