Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `j` and its range. The loop runs from `n-1` to `-1` with a step of `-1`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `j`**: The initial value of `j` is given as `-1`.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is greater than or equal to `-1`. Since the loop starts with `j = -1` and decrements by `-1`, the loop will stop when `j` becomes less than `-1`.

4. **Adjust the State**: To ensure the loop can execute, `j` must be within the range specified by the loop head. Initially, `j` is `-1`, which is valid since the loop will run until `j` becomes less than `-1`.

5. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`i`, `dp`, `t`, `n`, and `cards`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure `j` is within the valid range for the loop to execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `n-4`, `j` is `-1`, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` filled with zeros, `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `cards` list remains unchanged, `j` must be greater than or equal to `-1`**
