Output State: **`i` is `n-3`, `j` is `n-2`, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` filled with zeros except for `dp[n-1][0]` and `dp[n-2][0]` which are 0, `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5`, `cards` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `dp[i][j]` is updated to be the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1` for each `i` and `j` in the range defined by the dimensions of `dp`.**

The code updates the `dp` table based on the given formula, but since the exact values of `i` and `j` are not specified, and no specific `i` and `j` values are provided for updating, the general state of `dp` remains as described. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `cards`) remain unchanged.
