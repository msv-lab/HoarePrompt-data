Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `j`.
   - The loop runs from `n - 1` to `0` with a step of `-1`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is either `n-5` or `n-4`.
   - `j` is `-1`.
   - `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` filled with zeros.
   - `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
   - `cards` list remains unchanged.

3. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs as long as `j` is greater than or equal to `0`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `-1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be `0` because the loop runs from `n-1` to `0`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j` to `0`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is either `n-5` or `n-4`, `j` is `0`, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` filled with zeros (except for `dp[i][j]` which is updated based on the condition), `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `cards` list remains unchanged.**
