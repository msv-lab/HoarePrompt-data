Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j` and the range `range(n - 1, -1, -1)`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `j`**: The loop starts with `j = n - 1`.

3. **Understand the range**: The range `range(n - 1, -1, -1)` means `j` will iterate from `n - 1` down to `0`.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop will start with `j = n - 1`, we need to ensure that this value is correct. The other variables (`dp`, `t`, `n`, and `cards`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j` to be equal to `n - 1`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `n-3`, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1), filled with zeros; `dp[n-1][0]` is 0; `dp[n-2][0]` is 0; `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `cards` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers; `j` is `n-1`**
