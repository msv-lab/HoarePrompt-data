Output State: `i` is `0`, `j` is `0`, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` where each element is updated to the maximum value it can take based on the conditions specified in the loop body. Specifically, for each cell `dp[i][j]`, it is set to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]` depending on the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the `cards` list also remains unchanged.

This final state represents the complete execution of the loop where `i` starts from `n-4` and decreases to `0`, and `j` starts from `n-1` and decreases to `0`. The `dp` table is fully populated with the maximum values calculated according to the given conditions.
