Output State: **`i` is 1, `j` is `n-1`, `dp` is a 2D list of size `(n+1) x (n+1)` where each element is updated to the maximum value it can take based on the conditions specified in the loop body, `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the `cards` list also remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates `dp[i][j]` based on the maximum of three expressions involving indices `i + 1`, `i + 2`, and `j - 1`. However, since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `i` and `j` in the context of a loop, and only indicates their starting points (`i` is 0, `j` is `n-1`), the code modifies `i` to 1 while `j` remains `n-1`. The rest of the variables and lists remain unchanged as per the initial state.
