Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three non-negative integers representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals. For each test case, it calculates a specific value based on certain conditions and prints the cumulative sum of these values. If a condition is not met, it prints -1 for that test case.**
