Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the input format and processes multiple test cases.
2. For each test case, the program checks if the number of extroverts (`b`) is divisible by 3 or if there are enough universals to pair with the remaining extroverts. If not, it prints `-1`, which aligns with the problem statement.
3. The calculation of the number of tents required is done as follows:
   - `k += a` accounts for the tents needed for introverts, as each introvert needs a separate tent.
   - `(b + c) // 3` calculates the number of full tents that can be occupied by either extroverts or universals.
   - If there are any remaining extroverts or universals that cannot form a full tent, an additional tent is needed, which is handled by `if (b + c) % 3 != 0: k += 1`.
4. The overall logic seems to correctly implement the requirements stated in the problem description.

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
