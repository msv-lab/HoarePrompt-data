Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers inputted from the user, `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3`, `b` is either not divisible by 3 with `b % 3 + c` less than 3 or divisible by 3.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is incremented by the value of `a + (b + c) // 3`. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and the condition on `b` remain unchanged.
