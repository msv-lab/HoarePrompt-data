Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers inputted from the user.
- `k` is determined by the formula `a + (b + c) // 3` if `(b + c) % 3` equals 0, otherwise `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`.

The key point here is the calculation of `k`:

- If `(b + c) % 3 == 0`, then `k = a + (b + c) // 3`.
- Otherwise, `k = a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not specified, we need to consider both cases for `k`.

However, the problem does not require us to determine the exact value of `k` but rather to describe what will be printed. Given the formula for `k`, the print statement will output the value of `k` based on the conditions described.

Output: **k (where k is either a + (b + c) // 3 or a + (b + c) // 3 + 1 depending on whether (b + c) % 3 equals 0 or not)**
