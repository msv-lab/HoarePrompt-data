Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers inputted from the user.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial conditions for `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the value of `i` stays at 0.
