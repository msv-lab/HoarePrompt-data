Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` which represent the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.
3. The logic inside the loop checks if it's possible to accommodate all participants based on the given constraints:
   - If `b % 3 != 0` and `b % 3 + c < 3`, it means there are not enough universals to pair with the remaining extroverts, making it impossible to accommodate everyone, hence it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of tents required:
     - `a` introverts need `a` tents since each introvert needs a separate tent.
     - Extroverts and universals can share tents. The number of full tents needed for them is `(b + c) // 3`.
     - If there are any remaining extroverts or universals (`(b + c) % 3 != 0`), an additional tent is needed.
4. The program correctly prints the total number of tents required for each test case or `-1` if it's impossible to accommodate everyone.
5. The postconditions mentioned in the annotated program match the expected behavior of the function.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
