Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains three integers \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \) followed by a list of \( n \) integers representing the array \( a \). The function returns two items: a list named `results` containing the cumulative sum of `count` values from all iterations, and a dictionary named `residue_map` showing how many times each unique `(r_x, r_y)` pair appeared in the arrays.**
