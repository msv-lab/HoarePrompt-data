Output State: **`count` is 2, `results` is [0], `residue_map` is {(num % x, num % y): 2}, `n` is the number of elements in the next test case array, `x` is the second element of the next test case tuple, `y` is the second element of the next test case tuple, `arr` is the next test case array without the first two elements, `num` is the third element of `arr`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is (num % x, num % y), `r_x` is `-num % x`**.

The code updates the `current_key` to be `(num % x, num % y)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The new `current_key` is stored in the `residue_map` with a value of 2.
