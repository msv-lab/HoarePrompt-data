Output State: **`test_cases` is a list that must have at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `count` is the sum of the previous count and the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `(new_r_x, new_r_y)` having a value of 1, `current_key` is `num % x, num % y`, `r_x` is the remainder of `-num % x`, `r_y` is the remainder of `num % y`, `residue_map[current_key]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the `residue_map` dictionary by incrementing the count of the `current_key` (which is `num % x, num % y`). All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
