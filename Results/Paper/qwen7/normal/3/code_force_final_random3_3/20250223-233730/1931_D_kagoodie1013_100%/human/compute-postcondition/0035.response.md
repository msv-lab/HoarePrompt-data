Output State: **`arr` must have at least one element; `r_x` is `-num % x`**

Explanation: The code `r_x = -num % x` assigns the value of `-num % x` to the variable `r_x`. The initial state of `arr` remains unchanged as it was mentioned that `arr` must have at least one element, and no operations were performed on `arr`. The value of `r_x` is determined by the expression `-num % x`, which means `r_x` will be the remainder when `-num` is divided by `x`.
