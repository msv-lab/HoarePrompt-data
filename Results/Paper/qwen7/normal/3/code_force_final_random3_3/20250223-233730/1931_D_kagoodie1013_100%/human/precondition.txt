test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) representing the size of the array and Polycarp's favorite integers, followed by a list of n integers representing the elements of the array. Each n is in the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and each x and y is in the range 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
