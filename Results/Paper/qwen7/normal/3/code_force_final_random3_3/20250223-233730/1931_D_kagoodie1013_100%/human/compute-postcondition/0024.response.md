Output State: **`test_cases` is a list that must have at least one tuple, `results` is a list containing one element which is the cumulative sum of the values of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` for each iteration, `count` is the cumulative sum of the values of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` for each iteration, `residue_map` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each unique `(r_x, r_y)` pair derived from the loop, `current_key` is `num % x, num % y` for the last iteration, `r_x` is the remainder of `-num % x` for the last iteration, `r_y` is the remainder of `num % y` for the last iteration, and `residue_map[current_key]` is updated to the value of `residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1` for the last iteration.**

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `count` (which is the cumulative sum of the values of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` for each iteration) to the `results` list. After this operation, `results` contains one element, which is the final value of `count`. All other variables remain unchanged in terms of their descriptions, but their values are now updated according to the last iteration of the loop.
