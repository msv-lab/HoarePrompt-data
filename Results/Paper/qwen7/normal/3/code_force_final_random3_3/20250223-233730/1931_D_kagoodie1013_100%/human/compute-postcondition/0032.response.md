Output State: **`count` is increased by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `test_cases` is a list that must have at least two tuples, `arr` must have at least one element, `r_y` is the result of `num % y`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`**.

Explanation: The code assigns a new value to `current_key`, which is a tuple consisting of `num % x` and `num % y`. The other variables (`count`, `test_cases`, `arr`, and `r_y`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
