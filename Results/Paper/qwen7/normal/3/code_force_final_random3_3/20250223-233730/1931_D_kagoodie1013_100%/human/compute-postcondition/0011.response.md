Output State: **`test_cases` is a list that must have at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `count` is the value of `residue_map.get((new_r_x, new_r_y), 0)`, where `new_r_x` is the remainder of `-num % x` and `new_r_y` is the remainder of `num % y`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `(new_r_x, new_r_y)` having a value of 1, `current_key` is `num % x, num % y`, `r_x` is the remainder of `-num % x`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `r_x` as the remainder of `-num % x`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `count` is still `0 + the value of residue_map.get((new_r_x, new_r_y), 0)`, where `new_r_x` and `new_r_y` are defined as before.
