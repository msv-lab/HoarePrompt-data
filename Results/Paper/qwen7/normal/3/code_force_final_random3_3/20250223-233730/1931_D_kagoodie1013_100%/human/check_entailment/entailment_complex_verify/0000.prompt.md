You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

    #State: Output State: `results` is a list containing the cumulative sum of `count` values from all iterations, `count` is the total sum of occurrences of each unique pair `(r_x, r_y)` across all elements in all arrays in `test_cases`, `residue_map` is a dictionary that records the frequency of each unique pair `(r_x, r_y)` derived from all elements in all arrays in `test_cases`, `n` is the number of elements in the last test case array minus the number of elements processed so far, `x` is the third element of the last test case tuple, `y` is the third element of the last test case tuple, `arr` is the last test case array without the elements already processed, `num` is the current element being processed in the last array, `r_x` is the remainder of `-num % x`, `r_y` is the remainder of `num % y`, and `current_key` is the key `(num % x, num % y)` for the last element processed.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `results` will contain the final count of occurrences of each unique `(r_x, r_y)` pair across all arrays in `test_cases`. The `residue_map` will show how many times each unique `(r_x, r_y)` pair appeared in the arrays. The remaining variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `num`, `r_x`, `r_y`, and `current_key`) will reflect the state just before the last element of the last array is processed.

    #The program returns a list named `results` that contains the cumulative sum of `count` values from all iterations. This list reflects the final count of occurrences of each unique `(r_x, r_y)` pair across all arrays in `test_cases`. Additionally, the `residue_map` dictionary shows how many times each unique `(r_x, r_y)` pair appeared in the arrays. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `num`, `r_x`, `r_y`, and `current_key` reflect their state just before the last element of the last array is processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of tuples `test_cases` as input. Each tuple contains three integers \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \) followed by a list of \( n \) integers representing the array \( a \). It processes each test case to count the occurrences of each unique pair \((r_x, r_y)\), where \( r_x = -num \mod x \) and \( r_y = num \mod y \) for each element \( num \) in the array. The function accumulates these counts into a list `results`, which it returns. Additionally, it maintains a dictionary `residue_map` that records the frequency of each unique \((r_x, r_y)\) pair. After processing all test cases, the function returns the `results` list and the `residue_map` dictionary. The final states of the variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `num`, `r_x`, `r_y`, and `current_key` reflect their state just before the last element of the last array is processed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to count the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given conditions. It uses a residue map to efficiently count pairs that satisfy both conditions \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\). The program processes each test case independently and returns the correct count of beautiful pairs for each case. Given the structure and logic of the code, it appears to handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
