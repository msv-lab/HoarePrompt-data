You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \) followed by a list of \( n \) integers representing the array \( a \). The constraints are \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \), \( 2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 \), \( 1 \leq x, y \leq 10^9 \), and \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \). The sum of \( n \) over all test cases does not exceed \( 2 \cdot 10^5 \).
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        
        residue_map = {}
        
        for num in arr:
            r_x = -num % x
            r_y = num % y
            count += residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)
            current_key = num % x, num % y
            residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1
        
        results.append(count)
        
    #State: Output State: `results` is a list containing the cumulative sum of `count` values from all iterations, `count` is the total sum of occurrences of each unique pair `(r_x, r_y)` across all elements in all arrays in `test_cases`, `residue_map` is a dictionary that records the frequency of each unique pair `(r_x, r_y)` derived from all elements in all arrays in `test_cases`, `n` is the number of elements in the last test case array minus the number of elements processed so far, `x` is the third element of the last test case tuple, `y` is the third element of the last test case tuple, `arr` is the last test case array without the elements already processed, `num` is the current element being processed in the last array, `r_x` is the remainder of `-num % x`, `r_y` is the remainder of `num % y`, and `current_key` is the key `(num % x, num % y)` for the last element processed.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `results` will contain the final count of occurrences of each unique `(r_x, r_y)` pair across all arrays in `test_cases`. The `residue_map` will show how many times each unique `(r_x, r_y)` pair appeared in the arrays. The remaining variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `num`, `r_x`, `r_y`, and `current_key`) will reflect the state just before the last element of the last array is processed.
    return results
    #The program returns a list named `results` that contains the cumulative sum of `count` values from all iterations. This list reflects the final count of occurrences of each unique `(r_x, r_y)` pair across all arrays in `test_cases`. Additionally, the `residue_map` dictionary shows how many times each unique `(r_x, r_y)` pair appeared in the arrays. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `num`, `r_x`, `r_y`, and `current_key` reflect their state just before the last element of the last array is processed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains three integers \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \) followed by a list of \( n \) integers representing the array \( a \). The function returns two items: a list named `results` containing the cumulative sum of `count` values from all iterations, and a dictionary named `residue_map` showing how many times each unique `(r_x, r_y)` pair appeared in the arrays.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list named `results` that contains the cumulative sum of `count` values from all iterations. This list reflects the final count of occurrences of each unique `(r_x, r_y)` pair across all arrays in `test_cases`. Additionally, the `residue_map` dictionary shows how many times each unique `(r_x, r_y)` pair appeared in the arrays. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `num`, `r_x`, `r_y`, and `current_key` reflect their state just before the last element of the last array is processed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
