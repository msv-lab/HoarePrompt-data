### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its function `func_1` in detail to ensure it correctly implements the logic for counting beautiful pairs.

#### Key Points to Verify:
1. **Residue Calculation**: The program calculates residues \( r_x \) and \( r_y \) for each element in the array.
   - \( r_x = -num \mod x \)
   - \( r_y = num \mod y \)

2. **Counting Pairs**: The program uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the frequency of each unique pair \((r_x, r_y)\).
   - For each element, it checks how many previous elements have the same \((r_x, r_y)\) pair.
   - It increments the count of beautiful pairs accordingly.

3. **Processing Test Cases**: The program processes each test case independently and returns the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.

#### Detailed Analysis:
- **Residue Calculation**: The calculation of \( r_x = -num \mod x \) ensures that \( a_i + a_j \) is divisible by \( x \). This is because if \( a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \mod x \), then \( a_j \equiv -a_i \mod x \).
- **Pair Counting**: The use of `residue_map` allows efficient counting of pairs that satisfy both conditions. For each element, the program checks the frequency of the corresponding \((r_x, r_y)\) pair in the map, which helps in counting pairs that meet the criteria.

Given the detailed analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for counting beautiful pairs. The function `func_1` processes each test case independently and maintains the necessary state to accurately count the pairs.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of beautiful pairs based on the given conditions.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
