Output State: **`count` is increased by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `current_key` is `num % x, num % y`, `arr` must have at least one element, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `residue_map[(num % x, num % y)]` is incremented by 1, and `r_y` is `num % y`, `count` is updated by adding the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` to its current value.**

This means that the `count` variable has been updated by adding the value obtained from `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
