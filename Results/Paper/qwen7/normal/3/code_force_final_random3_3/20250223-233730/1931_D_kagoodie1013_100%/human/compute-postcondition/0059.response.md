Output State: **`count` is 0, `results` is `[0]`, `residue_map` is `{(num % x, num % y): 1}`, `n` is the number of elements in the next test case array, `x` is the second element of the next test case tuple, `y` is the second element of the next test case tuple, `arr` is the next test case array without the first element, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `r_y = num % y`, `r_x = -num % x`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `r_x` to `-num % x`. The value of `num % x` is not directly affected by this operation, so it remains as `r_x = -num % x`. All other variables retain their initial states.
