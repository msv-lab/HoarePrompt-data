Output State: **`test_cases` is a list that must have at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `count` is 0 + the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with the key `(r_x, r_y)` having a value of 1, `r_x` is the remainder of `-num % x`, `r_y` is the remainder of `num % y`, `current_key` is `num % x, num % y`.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the `residue_map` dictionary by setting the count of the current key `(r_x, r_y)` to 1. This means that the key `(r_x, r_y)` was not previously in the dictionary, so its value is set to 1.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, except for `count`, which is updated to include the new count from `residue_map`.
