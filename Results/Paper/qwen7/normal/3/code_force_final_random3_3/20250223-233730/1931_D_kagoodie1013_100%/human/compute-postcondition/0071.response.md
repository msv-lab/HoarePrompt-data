Output State: `count` is 6, `results` is [0], `residue_map` is `{(2, 2): 3}`, `n` is the number of elements in the next test case array minus 3, `x` is the second element of the next test case tuple, `y` is the second element of the next test case tuple, `arr` is the next test case array without the first three elements, `num` is the fourth element of `arr`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is (num % x, num % y).

In this final output state, the loop has completed all its iterations on the given array. The `count` variable reflects the cumulative sum of occurrences of each unique pair `(r_x, r_y)` across all elements in the original array, which sums up to 6 based on the provided information. The `residue_map` dictionary contains the count of each unique pair `(r_x, r_y)` found in the array, with the pair `(2, 2)` occurring 3 times. The `n` variable is updated to reflect the number of elements remaining in the array after the loop has processed the first three elements. The `x` and `y` variables remain as they were initially defined for the test case, and `arr` now contains the elements of the array excluding the first three elements processed by the loop.
