Output State: **`test_cases` is a list that must have at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `count` is 0 + the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `r_x` is the remainder of `-num % x`, `r_y` is the remainder of `num % y`, `current_key` is `num % x, num % y`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `num % x` to the first element of `current_key` and the value of `num % y` to the second element of `current_key`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
