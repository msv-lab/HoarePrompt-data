Output State: **`count` is increased by the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `test_cases` is a list that must have at least two tuples, `arr` must have at least one element, `r_y` is the result of `num % y`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `count` by adding the value returned by `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`. The other variables (`test_cases`, `arr`, and `r_y`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
