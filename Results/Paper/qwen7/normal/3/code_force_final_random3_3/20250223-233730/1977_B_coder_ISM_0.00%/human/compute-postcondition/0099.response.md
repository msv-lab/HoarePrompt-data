Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `length` must be at least 29, `s[2]` is '0', `s[1]` is '-1', `flag` is either 0 or 1.** 

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block, considering both the if and else parts. Since the else part does not change the variables' states, the postcondition remains as described in the if part.
