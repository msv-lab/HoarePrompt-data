Output State: **`i` is 1, `flag` is 0, `s[0]` is '0', and `s[1]` is '0'.**

Explanation: The code `s[i] = '0'` changes the value of `s[i]` from `'1'` to `'0'`. Since `i` is 1, `s[1]` is updated to `'0'`. The values of `i`, `flag`, and `s[0]` remain unchanged. Therefore, `i` is still 1, `flag` is still 0, `s[0]` is still '0', and `s[1]` is now '0'.
