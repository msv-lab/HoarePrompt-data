Output State: **`i` is 1, `flag` is 0, `s[0]` is '0', `s[1]` is '0', `s[2]` is '-1'**

Explanation: The code `s[i] = '-1'` changes the value of `s[1]` (since `i` is 1) to '-1'. The values of `i`, `flag`, `s[0]`, and the relationship between `s[0]` and `s[1]` remain unchanged. Initially, `s[0]` is either '0' or '1', and since `s[1]` is equal to `s[0]`, `s[1]` is also '0' or '1'. After the assignment, `s[1]` becomes '-1'. Therefore, `s[0]` remains '0' (as it was initially '0' or '1' and the code did not affect `s[0]`), and `s[1]` is now '-1'.
