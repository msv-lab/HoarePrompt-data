Output State: **`i` is 31; `length` is greater than 30; `s[30]` is '-1'**

Explanation: The code `s[i - 1] = '-1'` updates the character at index `i - 1` in the string `s` to be `'-'1'`. Given that `i` is 31, `i - 1` equals 30. Therefore, `s[30]` is now `'-'1'`. The values of `i` and `length` remain unchanged, and the condition that `length` is greater than 30 still holds.
