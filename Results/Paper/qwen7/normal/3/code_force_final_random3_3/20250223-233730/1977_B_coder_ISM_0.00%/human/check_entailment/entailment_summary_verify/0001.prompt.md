You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    1
    
    14
    
    24
    
    15
    
    27
    
    11
    
    19

Output

    1
    1
    5
    0 -1 0 0 1
    6
    0 0 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 0 0 1
    6
    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for nalla in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        s = []
        length = 30
        for i in range(30):
            if x & pow(2, i):
                s.append('1')
            else:
                s.append('0')
        print(*s)
        flag = 0
        for i in range(0, 29):
            if flag and s[i] == '0':
                s[i] = '1'
                flag = 0
            if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and (s[i] == '1'):
                s[i] = '-1'
                flag = 1
            elif flag == 1:
                s[i] = '0'
            else:
                pass
        if flag and s[29] == '0':
            s[29] = '1'
        elif flag:
            s[29] = '0'
            s.append('1')
            length += 1
        for i in range(1, length):
            if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
                s[i] = '0'
                s[i - 1] = '-1'
        print(length)
        print(*s)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 10^4) and another positive integer \( x \) (1 ≤ \( x \) < 2^30). For each test case, it converts \( x \) into its binary representation, modifies the binary string according to specific rules, and prints the modified binary string along with its length. The final state of the program includes printing the modified binary string and its length for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `x`.

2. **Binary Representation:**
   - The program constructs a binary representation of `x` using a list `s` where each element is either `'1'` or `'0'`.
   - This is done by iterating over bits from `2^0` to `2^29` and checking if the corresponding bit in `x` is set.
   - This part is correct and ensures that the sum of the constructed array equals `x`.

3. **Modifying the Binary Representation:**
   - The program aims to ensure that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist in the array.
   - It iterates over the list `s` and modifies elements based on certain conditions:
     - If a zero follows a one (`s[i] == '0'` and `s[i+1] == '1'`), it changes the zero to `-1`.
     - If a one is followed by another one (`s[i] == '1'` and `s[i+1] == '1'`), it changes the second one to `0`.
     - If a zero is followed by a one and the previous element was already modified to `-1`, it changes the current zero to `0`.
   - These modifications ensure that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - If the last element is `0` and needs to be changed to `1` to satisfy the conditions, it appends `1` to the list and increments the length.
   - This ensures that the final array meets the required conditions.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of the array and the array itself.

### Verification

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the program, let's verify if the program meets the requirements:

- **Binary Representation:** Correctly constructs the binary representation of `x`.
- **Modification Logic:** Ensures no two consecutive non-zero elements exist.
- **Edge Cases:** Handles edge cases correctly by appending `1` if necessary.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to generate an array that satisfies the given conditions.

**Correctness: **True**
