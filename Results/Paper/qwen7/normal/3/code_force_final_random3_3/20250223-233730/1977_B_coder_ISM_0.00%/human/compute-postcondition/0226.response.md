Output State: **`i` is 2, `length` is 30, `nalla` is 33, `x` is an input integer, `s` is ['1', '1', '1']**.

Explanation: The code snippet `s.append('1')` appends the string `'1'` to the list `s`. Initially, `s` is either `['1', '1']` if `x & pow(2, i)` is greater than 0, or `['0', '0']` otherwise. Since `i` is 2, `pow(2, i)` equals 4. Therefore, `s` was initially `['1', '1']` because `x & 4` would only be greater than 0 if `x` has the bit at position 2 set, which aligns with the condition for `s` to be `['1', '1']`. After appending `'1'` to `s`, the list becomes `['1', '1', '1']`. The values of `i`, `length`, `nalla`, and `x` remain unchanged.
