Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` will be 29, `length` will remain 30, `nalla` will still be 33, `x` will remain as an input integer, `flag` will be 0, and `s` will contain 30 elements, each being either '1' or '0', representing the binary form of `x` with the MSB at the beginning and LSB at the end.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, 29):
    if flag and s[i] == '0':
        s[i] = '1'
        flag = 0
    if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
        s[i] = '-1'
        flag = 1
    elif flag == 1:
        s[i] = '0'
    else:
        pass


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `flag` is a boolean and `s` is a string. If `flag` is True, then the character at index `i` of string `s` is no longer '1'. If `flag` is False or the character at index `i` of string `s` is '1', then the character at index `i` of string `s` is equal to the character at index `i + 1` of string `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `flag` is a boolean, `s` is a string such that if `flag` is True, the character at index 1 of `s` is '1', otherwise the character at index 1 of `s` is '0'. If `flag` is 0, `s[i]` (which is `s[1]`) is changed to '-1'. Otherwise, the character at index 1 of `s` remains as specified by the value of `flag`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `flag` is a boolean, and the character at index 1 of `s` is '-'. If `flag` is True, the character at index 1 of `s` remains '0'. Otherwise, the character at index 1 of `s` remains '1'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
