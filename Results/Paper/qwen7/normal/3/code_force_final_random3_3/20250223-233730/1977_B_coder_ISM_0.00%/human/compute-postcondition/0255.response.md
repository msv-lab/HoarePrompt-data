Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and the range is from `0` to `29`.

2. **Understand the postcondition**: The postcondition given is based on the value of `flag` and the string `s`. It tells us that if `flag` is True, the character at index `i` of string `s` is no longer '1'. If `flag` is False or the character at index `i` of string `s` is '1', then the character at index `i` of string `s` is equal to the character at index `i + 1` of string `s`.

3. **Determine the next state**: Since the loop is iterating over `i` from `0` to `29`, the next value of `i` will be `1` (assuming `i` starts from `0`).

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - The variable `i` will be incremented by `1` from its current value.
   - The value of `flag` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.
   - The string `s` might change based on the value of `flag` and the current character at index `i` of `s`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `i` and the condition for `flag` and `s` based on the postcondition.

**State:**
- `i` is now `1`.
- `flag` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `s` will depend on the value of `flag` and the character at index `1` of `s`:
  - If `flag` is True, the character at index `1` of `s` is no longer '1'.
  - If `flag` is False or the character at index `1` of `s` is '1', then the character at index `1` of `s` is equal to the character at index `2` of `s`.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `flag` is a boolean, `s` is a string such that if `flag` is True, the character at index 1 of `s` is no longer '1', otherwise the character at index 1 of `s` is equal to the character at index 2 of `s`**.
