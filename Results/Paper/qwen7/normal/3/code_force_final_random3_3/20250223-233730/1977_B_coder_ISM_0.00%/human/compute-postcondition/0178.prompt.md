Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `flag` is 0, `s` is a list of 30 elements where each element is either '1' or '0' based on the condition `x & pow(2, i)` for `i` ranging from 0 to 29, `length` is 30, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `t` is increased by 1, and `x` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, 29):
    if flag and s[i] == '0':
        s[i] = '1'
        flag = 0
    if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
        s[i] = '-1'
        flag = 1
    elif flag == 1:
        s[i] = '0'
    else:
        pass


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `flag` remains unchanged. If `flag` is 1, then `s[i]` is '1' and `s[i]` is equal to `s[i + 1]`. Otherwise, `flag` is not 1, or `s[i]` is not '1', or `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 1, `flag` remains unchanged, and `s` is updated such that if `flag` is 0 and `s[1]` is '1', then `flag` remains 0, and if `flag` is 1 and `s[1]` is '0', then the function does nothing. In all other cases, `s[1]` is updated to '-1'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `flag` remains unchanged, and `s` is updated such that the element at index 2 is now '0' if `flag` is 1, and '1' if `flag` is not 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
