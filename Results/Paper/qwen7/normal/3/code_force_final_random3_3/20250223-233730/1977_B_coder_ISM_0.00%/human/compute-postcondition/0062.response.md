Output State: **`i` is 2, `flag` is either 0 or 1, `s[0]` is either '0' or '1', `s[1]` is equal to `s[0]`, `s[2]` is '1'**

Explanation: The code assigns the value `'1'` to `s[i]`, where `i` is 2. Since `s[1]` was previously equal to `s[0]`, and `s[0]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`, `s[1]` is also either `'0'` or `'1'`. After executing the code, `s[2]` is set to `'1'`. All other variables remain unchanged.
