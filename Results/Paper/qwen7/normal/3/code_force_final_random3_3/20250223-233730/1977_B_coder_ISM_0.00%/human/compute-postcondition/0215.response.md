Output State: **`i` is 0, `length` is 30, `s` is ['1'], `nalla` is 33, `x` is an input integer, and the current value of `x` & 2^`i` is greater than 0**

Explanation: The code `s.append('1')` adds the string '1' to the list `s`. Initially, `s` is an empty list, so after appending '1', `s` becomes `['1']`. The values of `i`, `length`, `nalla`, and `x` remain unchanged, and the condition `x & 2^i > 0` still holds true since `i` is 0 and `x & 1 > 0` (as `2^0` is 1).
