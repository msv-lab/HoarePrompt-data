Output State: `i` is equal to `x + 1`, `x` can be any value that allows the loop to execute at least `x + 1` times, starting from at least 2, `z` is the result of repeatedly applying the operation `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` for `x + 1` times.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be `x + 1`, `x` can be any value that allows the loop to run at least `x + 1` times (starting from at least 2), and `z` will have been updated according to the rule `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration of the loop.
