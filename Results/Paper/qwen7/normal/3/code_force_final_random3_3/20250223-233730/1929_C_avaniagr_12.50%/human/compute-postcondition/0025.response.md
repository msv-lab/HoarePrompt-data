Output State: **`x` must be between 1 and 100; `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` updates the value of `z` by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value. However, since the initial value of `z` is not specified, we only know that `z` has been updated according to this formula. The precondition that `x` must be between 1 and 100 remains unchanged.
