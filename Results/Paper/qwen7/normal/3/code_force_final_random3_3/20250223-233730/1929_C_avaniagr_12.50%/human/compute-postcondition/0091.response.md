Postcondition: `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 30\), `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 100\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\), `z` is either 5 or 6 depending on whether `a` is less than 5 or greater than or equal to 5, `i` is equal to `x + 1`, and `t` is `t - 1`. If `x == k - 1`, then `i` remains as `x + 1` and `z` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `i` is equal to `x + 1`, `z` is the final value obtained after performing the operation `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration from 1 to `x + 1`, and whether `a` is greater than or equal to `z` or less than `z` does not affect the final values of `i` and `z`.
