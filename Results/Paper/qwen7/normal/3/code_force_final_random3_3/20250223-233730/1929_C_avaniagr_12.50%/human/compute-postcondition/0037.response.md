Postcondition: `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 30, `x` is an integer such that 0 <= x <= 100, `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, `t` must be greater than 0, `z` is the result of repeatedly adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to itself for `x + 1` times, and `a` is either greater than or equal to `z` or less than `z` depending on whether `a` is initially greater than or equal to `x + 3` or not.
