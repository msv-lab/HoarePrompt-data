Output State: **`k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 30\), `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 100\), `a` is an integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\), `t` is now `t - 1`, `z` is 2, `x` must be a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq x \leq 100\)**.

Explanation: The variable `z` is updated by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value. Given the initial state, `z` starts as 1. Since `k` is between 2 and 30, `(k - 1)` ranges from 1 to 29. Therefore, `z // (k - 1)` will be 0 because `z` is 1 and any number divided by a number greater than 1 results in 0 when using integer division. Adding 1 to 0 gives 1. Thus, `z` becomes `1 + 1`, which is 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given code snippet.
