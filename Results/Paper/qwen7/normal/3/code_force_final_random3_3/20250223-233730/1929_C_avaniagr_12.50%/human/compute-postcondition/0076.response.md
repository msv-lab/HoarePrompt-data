Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `x + 1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially set to 3.
   - `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 100\).

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `x + 1`. 

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts at 3, for the loop to execute, `x + 1` must be at least 3. This means `x` must be at least 2.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `x` is at least 2.

5. **Other variables**:
   - `k`, `a`, `z`, and `t` are not part of the loop head and their values do not affect whether the loop can execute. They can remain as given.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `x` and `i`.

**Final State**:
- `i` is 3.
- `x` must be at least 2.

So, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is 3, `x` must be at least 2**.
