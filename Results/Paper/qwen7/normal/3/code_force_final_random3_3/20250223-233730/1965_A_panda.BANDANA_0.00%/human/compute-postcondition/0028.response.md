Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `e` is a set containing unique elements from the list `l`, `m` is the length of the list `l`, `n` is the integer entered by the user after splitting and converting the input string, `m` is the length of the list `l`. If `1` is in the list `l`, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. Otherwise, the postcondition also remains the same as the precondition.**
