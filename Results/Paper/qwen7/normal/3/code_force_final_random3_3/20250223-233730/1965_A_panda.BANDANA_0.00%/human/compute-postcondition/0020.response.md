Postcondition: ***`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `e` is a set containing unique elements from the list `l`, `m` is the length of the list `l`. If 1 is in the list `l`, the postcondition remains unchanged. If 1 is not in the list `l`, the postcondition also remains unchanged.***
