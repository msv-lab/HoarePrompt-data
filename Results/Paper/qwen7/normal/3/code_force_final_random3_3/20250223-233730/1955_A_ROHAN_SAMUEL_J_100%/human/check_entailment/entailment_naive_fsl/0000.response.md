Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where buying yogurts at the promotion price is more advantageous, especially when `n` is odd. Specifically, the program fails to consider the scenario where buying `(n // 2) * 2` yogurts at the promotion price and the remaining one at the regular price would result in a lower cost.

For example, consider the case where `n = 3`, `a = 5`, and `b = 11`. According to the problem description, the optimal way to buy these yogurts is to buy two at the promotion price (11 burles) and one at the regular price (5 burles), resulting in a total cost of 16 burles. However, the program incorrectly calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b + a = 1 * 11 + 5 = 16`, which is not the minimum cost.

To fix this, the program should calculate the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and then buy the remaining yogurts at the regular price. Here's the corrected version:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((n // 2) * b + max(n % 2, 0) * a)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program handles all cases correctly, including when buying at the promotion price is more advantageous.
