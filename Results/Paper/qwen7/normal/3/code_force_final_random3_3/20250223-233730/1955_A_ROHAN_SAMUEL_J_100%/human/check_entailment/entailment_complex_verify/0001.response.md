### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the provided example cases.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - It then processes each test case using a loop that runs `t` times.

2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**:
   - For each test case, the program reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` using `map(int, input().split())`.

3. **Calculation Logic**:
   - The program checks if `n` is odd (`if n % 2`):
     - If `n` is odd, it further checks if the cost of two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is less than the promotion price (`b`).
       - If `2 * a < b`, it prints `a * n` (cost of buying all yogurts at the regular price).
       - Otherwise, it calculates the cost by buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurt at the regular price (`n // 2 * b + a`).
   - If `n` is even, it directly checks if the cost of two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is less than the promotion price (`b`).
     - If `2 * a < b`, it prints `a * n` (cost of buying all yogurts at the regular price).
     - Otherwise, it prints `n // 2 * b` (cost of buying all yogurts at the promotion price).

### Verification with Example Cases:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `2 5 9`
   - Calculation:
     - `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
     - Since `n` is even, check `2 * a < b`: `2 * 5 = 10 > 9`
     - Print `n // 2 * b = 1 * 9 = 9`

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `3 5 9`
   - Calculation:
     - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
     - Since `n` is odd, check `2 * a < b`: `2 * 5 = 10 > 9`
     - Print `n // 2 * b + a = 1 * 9 + 5 = 14`

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `3 5 11`
   - Calculation:
     - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
     - Since `n` is odd, check `2 * a < b`: `2 * 5 = 10 < 11`
     - Print `a * n = 5 * 3 = 15`

4. **Test Case 4**:
   - Input: `4 5 11`
   - Calculation:
     - `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
     - Since `n` is even, check `2 * a < b`: `2 * 5 = 10 < 11`
     - Print `n // 2 * b = 2 * 11 = 22`

### Issues Found:

Upon closer inspection, we notice that the program does not handle the case where `n` is odd and `2 * a >= b` correctly. Specifically, the program should calculate the cost by buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurt at the regular price, which is not being done correctly.

### Corrected Logic:

For the case where `n` is odd and `2 * a >= b`, the correct calculation should be:
- Buy as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price.
- Buy the remaining yogurt at the regular price.

### Corrected Code:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a >= b:
                print((n // 2) * b + a)
            else:
                print(a * n)
        else:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b)
```

### Verification with Example Cases:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `2 5 9`
   - Calculation:
     - `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
     - Since `n` is even, check `2 * a < b`: `2 * 5 = 10 > 9`
     - Print `n // 2 * b = 1 * 9 = 9`

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `3 5 9`
   - Calculation:
     - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
     - Since `n` is odd, check `2 * a < b`: `2 * 5 = 10 > 9`
     - Print `n // 2 * b + a = 1 * 9 + 5 = 14`

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `3 5 11`
   - Calculation:
     - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
     - Since `n` is odd, check `2 * a < b`: `2 * 5 = 10 < 11`
     - Print `a * n = 5 * 3 = 15`

4. **Test Case 4**:
   - Input: `4 5 11`
   - Calculation:
     - `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
     - Since `n` is even, check `2 * a < b`: `2 * 5 = 10 < 11`
     - Print `n // 2 * b = 2 * 11 = 22`

### Conclusion:

The original assessment was accurate up to the point of handling the logic for odd `n`. However, the program did not correctly handle the case where `n` is odd and `2 * a >= b`. The corrected logic ensures that the program now handles all cases correctly.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False** (The original program had an issue with handling the case where `n` is odd and `2 * a >= b`.)

Final: **False**
