Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\), `n` is the integer input split from the first space, `a` is the integer input split from the second space, `b` is the integer input split from the third space, the number of remaining iterations is `int(input()) - 1`**.

This means that the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` have been updated to the integers obtained from the input. The number of remaining iterations is now `int(input()) - 1`.
