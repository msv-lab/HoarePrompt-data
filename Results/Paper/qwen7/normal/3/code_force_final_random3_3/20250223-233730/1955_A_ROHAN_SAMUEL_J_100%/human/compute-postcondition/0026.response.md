Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\).
- `n` is an integer from the input.
- `a` is an integer from the input.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(a * n)
```

Here, `a` and `n` are explicitly mentioned as integers from the input. The value of `t` is not relevant to the print statement since it does not appear in the expression being printed.

Therefore, the print statement will output the product of `a` and `n`.

Output: **a * n (where a and n are integers from the input)**
