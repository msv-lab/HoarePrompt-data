Output: **n // 2 * b + a (where n is an integer from the input, a is an integer from the input, b is an integer from the input, and `//` denotes integer division)**

Explanation:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\). However, `t` is not used in the print statement, so it does not affect the output.
- `n` is an integer from the input.
- `a` is an integer from the input.
- `b` is an integer from the input.
- The expression `n // 2 * b + a` is evaluated and printed. Here, `n // 2` performs integer division of `n` by 2, resulting in the largest integer less than or equal to `n / 2`. This result is then multiplied by `b`, and `a` is added to the product.

Thus, the output is the value of the expression `n // 2 * b + a`.
