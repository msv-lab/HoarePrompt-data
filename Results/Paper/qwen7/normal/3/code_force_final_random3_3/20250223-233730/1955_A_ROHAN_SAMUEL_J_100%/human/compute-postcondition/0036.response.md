Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\).
- `n` is the integer input split from the first space.
- `a` is the integer input split from the second space.
- `b` is the integer input split from the third space.
- The number of remaining iterations is `int(input()) - 1`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(n // 2 * b)
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `n` is an integer input split from the first space. This means `n` is an integer provided by the user as the first argument when the program runs.
2. `b` is an integer input split from the third space. This means `b` is another integer provided by the user as the third argument when the program runs.
3. The expression `n // 2 * b` calculates the integer division of `n` by 2 and then multiplies the result by `b`.

Given these steps, the print statement will output the result of the expression `n // 2 * b`.

Output: **n // 2 * b (where n is the integer input split from the first space and b is the integer input split from the third space)**
