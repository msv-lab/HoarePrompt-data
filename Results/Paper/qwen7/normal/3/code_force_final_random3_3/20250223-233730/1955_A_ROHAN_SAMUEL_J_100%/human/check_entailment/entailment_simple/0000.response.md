Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. The logic for calculating the minimum cost is as follows:
   - If `n` is odd, it checks whether buying two yogurts at the promotion price (`2*a`) is cheaper than buying one yogurt at the regular price (`a`). If `2*a < b`, it's cheaper to buy one yogurt at the regular price, so the total cost is `a * n`. Otherwise, it's cheaper to buy as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurt at the regular price, resulting in `n // 2 * b + a`.
   - If `n` is even, it directly checks whether buying two yogurts at the promotion price (`2*a`) is cheaper than buying one yogurt at the regular price (`a`). If `2*a < b`, it's cheaper to buy all yogurts at the regular price, so the total cost is `a * n`. Otherwise, it's cheaper to buy as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price, resulting in `n // 2 * b`.

This logic correctly handles both even and odd values of `n` and compares the costs accurately.

Given this analysis, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
