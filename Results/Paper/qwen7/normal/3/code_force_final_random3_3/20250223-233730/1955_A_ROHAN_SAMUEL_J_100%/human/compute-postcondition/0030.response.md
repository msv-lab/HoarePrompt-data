Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined as `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the number of iterations, which is determined by `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is given as:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\)
   - `n` is an integer from the input
   - `a` is an integer from the input
   - `b` is an integer from the input

3. **Determine the effect of the loop**: The loop runs for a number of times equal to the value of `int(input())`. Since `_` is a placeholder and not used in the loop body, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged within the loop.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, the number of remaining iterations must be decremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `int(input())` should be reduced by 1.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- `t` is still an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\)
- `n` is still an integer from the input
- `a` is still an integer from the input
- `b` is still an integer from the input
- The number of remaining iterations is now `int(input()) - 1`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\), `n` is an integer from the input, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, the number of remaining iterations is `int(input()) - 1`**
