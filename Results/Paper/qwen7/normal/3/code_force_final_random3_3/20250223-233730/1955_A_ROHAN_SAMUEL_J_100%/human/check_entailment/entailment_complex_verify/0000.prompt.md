You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - (number of iterations - 1), n, a, and b are integers as described, and all iterations of the loop have been executed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers \( t \), \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \). For each test case, it calculates and prints either \( a \times n \) or \( \frac{n}{2} \times b + a \) or \( \frac{n}{2} \times b \) based on the conditions provided. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where buying yogurts at the promotion price is more advantageous, especially when `n` is odd. Specifically, the program fails to consider the scenario where buying `(n // 2) * 2` yogurts at the promotion price and the remaining one at the regular price would result in a lower cost.

For example, consider the case where `n = 3`, `a = 5`, and `b = 11`. According to the problem description, the optimal way to buy these yogurts is to buy two at the promotion price (11 burles) and one at the regular price (5 burles), resulting in a total cost of 16 burles. However, the program incorrectly calculates the cost as `n // 2 * b + a = 1 * 11 + 5 = 16`, which is not the minimum cost.

To fix this, the program should calculate the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and then buy the remaining yogurts at the regular price. Here's the corrected version:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((n // 2) * b + max(n % 2, 0) * a)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program handles all cases correctly, including when buying at the promotion price is more advantageous.
