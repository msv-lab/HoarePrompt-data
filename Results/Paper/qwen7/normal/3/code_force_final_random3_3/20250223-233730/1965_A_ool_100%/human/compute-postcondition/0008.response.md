Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being set to 1 (since the range function in Python starts from the first argument, which is 1 in this case).

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of `set_`. Therefore, `i` must be less than the length of `set_` for the loop to execute.

4. **Consider the initial state of `set_`**: The problem states that `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order, and the first element of `set_` is 1. This information is not directly relevant to the loop's execution but helps us understand the structure of `set_`.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Since `i` starts at 1 and the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of `set_`, we need to ensure that `i` is less than the length of `set_`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be 1 (as specified by the loop initialization).
- `set_` must have at least 2 elements for the loop to execute (since `i` starts at 1 and the loop continues as long as `i` is less than the length of `set_`).

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`A` is False, `not_c` is True, `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1**
