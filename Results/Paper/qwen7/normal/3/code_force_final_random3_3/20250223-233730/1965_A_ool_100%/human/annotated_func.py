#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile, where the length of the list n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and each element a_i in the list satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func_1(arr):
    A = False
    set_ = list(set(arr))
    set_.sort()
    if (set_[0] != 1) :
        return 'Alice'
        #The program returns 'Alice'
    #State: `A` is False; `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order. The first element of `set_` is 1
    not_c = True
    for i in range(1, len(set_)):
        if set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1:
            not_c = False
            break
        
        A = not A
        
    #State: Output State: `A` is False, `not_c` is False, `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order with at least 3 elements, and `i` is 3.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `A` alternates starting from `True` (as it was initially `False` and changes each iteration). Since the loop breaks when the condition `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1` is met, and given that the loop has completed 3 iterations, it means that the difference between consecutive elements in `set_` has never exceeded 1. Therefore, `not_c` remains `False`. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of `set_` minus one, which is 3 in this case, indicating that the loop has fully executed. The state of `set_` remains as described, being a sorted list of unique elements from `arr`.
    if not_c :
        A = not A
    #State: `A` alternates starting from `False`, `not_c` remains `False`, `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order with at least 3 elements, and `i` is 3.
    return 'Alice' if A else 'Bob'
    #The program returns 'Alice'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr`, representing the initial number of stones in each pile. It first removes duplicate values from `arr` and sorts the resulting list in ascending order. If the smallest value in the sorted list is not 1, it returns 'Alice'. Otherwise, it checks if the difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list exceeds 1. If such a difference is found, it sets a flag `not_c` to `False` and exits the loop. The function then alternates the value of `A` based on the loop's execution. Finally, it returns 'Alice' if `A` is true, otherwise it returns 'Bob'. In all cases, the function returns 'Alice'.
