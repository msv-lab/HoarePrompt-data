Postcondition: `A` is False, `not_c` is False, `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order with at least 2 elements, and `i` is 1. If the difference between the current element and the previous element in `set_` is greater than 1, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
