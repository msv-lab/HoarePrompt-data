Output State: **The program returns 'Alice'**

Explanation: Given the initial state, `A` alternates starting from `False`. Since `i` is 3, and `A` starts from `False` and alternates (i.e., `False`, `True`, `False`, ...), `A` is currently `False`. Therefore, the condition `if A` evaluates to `False`, and the program returns `'Alice'`.
