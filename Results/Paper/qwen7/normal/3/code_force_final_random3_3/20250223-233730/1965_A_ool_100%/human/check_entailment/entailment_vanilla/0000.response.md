Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the sizes of the piles.
   - This part of the code is correct and handles the input as specified.

2. **Calling the Function:**
   - The program calls the function `func_1` with the array of pile sizes.
   - This function is supposed to determine the winner based on the given rules.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function first converts the array to a set and sorts it.
   - It checks if the smallest pile has more than 1 stone. If true, it immediately returns "Alice".
   - It then iterates through the sorted unique pile sizes to check if the difference between consecutive pile sizes is exactly 1.
   - If any difference is greater than 1, it sets `not_c` to `False`.
   - It alternates the boolean variable `A` for each pile size.
   - Finally, it returns "Alice" if `A` is `True`, otherwise "Bob".

### Correctness Check:

1. **Initial Condition:**
   - If the smallest pile has more than 1 stone, Alice wins immediately. This is correctly handled.

2. **Sequence Check:**
   - The logic to check if the sequence of pile sizes is consecutive (i.e., difference of 1 between consecutive piles) is flawed.
   - The current implementation only checks the difference between the first two elements and does not ensure the entire sequence is consecutive.
   - For example, if the piles are `[1, 2, 4]`, the function incorrectly returns "Alice" because the difference between 2 and 4 is not checked.

3. **Alternating Boolean:**
   - The alternating boolean `A` is used to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of piles with a difference of 1. However, this logic is incorrect.
   - The correct approach should be to count the number of piles with a difference of 1 and use this count to determine the winner.

### Correct Solution:

To correctly determine the winner, we need to count the number of piles with a difference of 1 and use this count to determine the winner. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    count = 0
    prev = None
    for pile in arr:
        if prev is not None and pile - prev == 1:
            count += 1
        prev = pile
    return 'Alice' if count % 2 == 0 else 'Bob'
```

### Conclusion:

The given program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in the `func_1` function. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
