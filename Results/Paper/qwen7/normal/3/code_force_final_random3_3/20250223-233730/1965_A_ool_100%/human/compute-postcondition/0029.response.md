Output State: `A` is False, `not_c` is False, `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order with at least 3 elements, and `i` is 3.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `A` alternates starting from `True` (as it was initially `False` and changes each iteration). Since the loop breaks when the condition `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1` is met, and given that the loop has completed 3 iterations, it means that the difference between consecutive elements in `set_` has never exceeded 1. Therefore, `not_c` remains `False`. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of `set_` minus one, which is 3 in this case, indicating that the loop has fully executed. The state of `set_` remains as described, being a sorted list of unique elements from `arr`.
