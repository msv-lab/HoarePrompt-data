Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly describes the logic of the `func_1` function.
2. The function first removes duplicates and sorts the array to get unique values in ascending order.
3. If the smallest value is not 1, it immediately returns 'Alice'.
4. It then checks if the difference between any two consecutive elements exceeds 1. If so, it sets a flag `not_c` to `False` and exits the loop.
5. The function alternates the boolean value of `A` based on the loop's execution.
6. Finally, it returns 'Alice' if `A` is true, otherwise 'Bob'.

Given the problem statement and the function's behavior, the function correctly determines the winner based on the game rules. The function logic matches the problem requirements and the provided example test cases.

Correctness: **True**
