Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers.**

The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads `n` integers from the input and splits them into a list. This list is then assigned to the variable `a`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
