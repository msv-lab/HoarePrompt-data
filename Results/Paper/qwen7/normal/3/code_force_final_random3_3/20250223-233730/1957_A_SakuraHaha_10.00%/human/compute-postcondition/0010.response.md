Output State: `ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a dictionary with multiple key-value pairs where each key is an element from the original list `a` and each value is the count of occurrences of that element in the original list `a`.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, all elements of the list `a` have been processed. The variable `x` iterates through each element of `a`, and for each element, it updates the count in the dictionary `cnt`. Once all elements have been processed, `a` becomes an empty list because each element is removed on its first occurrence. The dictionary `cnt` contains the counts of each unique element from the original list `a`.
