Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for x in cnt.values()`. The objects involved here are `x` and `cnt`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each value in the `cnt` dictionary. Each value `x` represents the count of occurrences of an element from the original list `a`.

3. **Determine the initial state requirements**: Since the loop iterates over `cnt.values()`, the dictionary `cnt` must contain at least one value for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjust the state**: We need to ensure that `cnt` has at least one value. The other variables (`ans`, `t`, `n`, `a`, and `cnt`'s keys) are not directly relevant to the loop's execution and can remain as they are.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `cnt` must have at least one value.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` must have at least one value**
