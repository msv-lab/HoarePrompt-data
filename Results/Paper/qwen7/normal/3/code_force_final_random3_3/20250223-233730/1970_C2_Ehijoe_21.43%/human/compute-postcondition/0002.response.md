Output State: **`empty` is True, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, and `nodes` is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree where each key is a node and its value is a list of its neighbors.**

The code simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `empty`. No other variables are affected, so their initial states remain unchanged.
