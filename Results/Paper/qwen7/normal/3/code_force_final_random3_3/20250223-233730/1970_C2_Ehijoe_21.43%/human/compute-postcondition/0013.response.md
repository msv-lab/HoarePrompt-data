Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer.**

The code `u, v = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `u` and `v`. Since the initial state of `i` and `n` is not affected by this code, their values remain the same. The values of `u` and `v` are set to the integers entered by the user.
