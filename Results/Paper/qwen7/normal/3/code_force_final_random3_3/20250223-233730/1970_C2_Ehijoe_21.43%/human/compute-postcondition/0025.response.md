Output State: **`nodes` is a dictionary with at least one key; `leaves` is a list with the key appended.**

Explanation: The code `leaves.append(key)` appends the value of `key` to the list `leaves`. Since `nodes` is a dictionary with at least one key, its state remains unchanged. The list `leaves` now contains the key from the dictionary `nodes`.
