Postcondition: `nodes` is a dictionary with at least one key. If the length of `nodes[key]` is 1, then `key` is appended to `leaves`, making `leaves` a list containing the updated value of `key`, and `next_key` remains unchanged. If the length of `nodes[key]` is not 1, then `leaves` remains unchanged.
