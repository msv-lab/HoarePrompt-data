Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `u, v = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `u` and `v`. The initial values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. The input range for `n` is preserved, and the newly assigned variables `u` and `v` are integers resulting from the split and conversion operation.
