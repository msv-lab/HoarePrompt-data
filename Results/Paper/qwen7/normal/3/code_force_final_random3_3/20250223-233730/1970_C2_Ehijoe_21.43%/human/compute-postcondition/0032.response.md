Output State: **The `leaves` list contains all keys from the `nodes` dictionary whose associated list has a length of exactly 1.**

In Natural Language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the `leaves` list will contain every key from the `nodes` dictionary that points to exactly one other node. This means that for each key in the `nodes` dictionary, if the length of the list associated with that key is 1, that key will be added to the `leaves` list. No other changes are made to the `leaves` list or any other variables outside the loop.
