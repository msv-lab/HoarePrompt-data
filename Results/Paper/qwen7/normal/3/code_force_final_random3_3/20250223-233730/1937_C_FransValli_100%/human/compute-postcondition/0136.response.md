Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `i` is equal to `n`, and `n` must be greater than 0. This means `i` is a positive integer.
   - `res` is an input string. Since no specific value for `res` is provided, it remains as a string but does not affect the print statement directly.
   - `arr` must have at least 2 elements. Let's denote the elements of `arr` as `arr[0]`, `arr[1]`, `arr[2]`, etc., where `arr[1]` is the second element of `arr`.
   - `item` is explicitly stated to be the second element of `arr`, so `item = arr[1]`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)`.
   - There is a typo in the statement: `mini` should likely be `i` (or possibly another variable, but based on the given information, it should be `i`).
   - Therefore, the corrected print statement would be `print('?', i, i, item, item, flush=True)`.

Given this, the print statement will output:
- A question mark (`?`)
- The value of `i` (which is `n`)
- The value of `i` again
- The value of `item` (which is the second element of `arr`)

So, the output will be:

Output: **'? [i] [i] [item] [item]** (where `[i]` is the value of `i` and `[item]` is the second element of `arr`)
