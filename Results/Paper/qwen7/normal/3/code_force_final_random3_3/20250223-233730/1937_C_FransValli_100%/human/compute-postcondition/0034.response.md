Postcondition: `i` is a value in the range [1, n-1], `n` must be at least 4, `res` is a string that is not equal to '<', and `arr` is a list containing the value of `i`. If `res` equals '=', then `arr` contains the value of `i`; otherwise, `arr` still contains the value of `i` as no change occurs in the else part.
