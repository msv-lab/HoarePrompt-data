Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `mini` is equal to `arr[0]`, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `n` must be at least 4, `res` is an input string, and `arr` will contain a list of integers starting from the smallest index `i_prev` up to `n-1`.
Code of the loop:
for item in arr[1:]:
    print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
    res = input()
    if res == '>':
        mini = item


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `arr` must have at least 2 elements, `item` is `arr[1]`, `res` is an input string. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is `arr[1]`. There is no change in `res` and `item` in other cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `arr` must have at least 3 elements, `item` is `arr[2]`, `res` is an input string, `mini` is unchanged if `res` was '>', `mini` is set to `arr[2]` if `res` equals '>'

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `arr` must have at least 3 elements, `item` is `arr[3]`, `mini` is either `arr[3]` if `res` equals '>', or remains unchanged if `res` does not equal '>' and is an input string from user input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
