Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `maxi` is 0, `res` is an input string.**

Explanation: The variable `res` is assigned the value of `input()`, which reads a line of text from the standard input and converts it into a string. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `maxi` remain unchanged from their initial states.
