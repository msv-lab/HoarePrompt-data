Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `res` is an input string
   - `arr` contains the element 2

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(1, n)`.
   - This means the loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` until `i < n`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.

4. **Next Value of `i`:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented from 2 to 3.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 3.

5. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
   - Since `i` is now 3, the condition `i < n` will hold true if `n` is greater than 3.

6. **Adjusting the State:**
   - We need to ensure that `i` is set to 3.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0 (it could be any value greater than 3).
   - `res` and `arr` remain unchanged according to the postconditions provided.

Based on this reasoning, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `res` is an input string, and `arr` contains the element 2**
