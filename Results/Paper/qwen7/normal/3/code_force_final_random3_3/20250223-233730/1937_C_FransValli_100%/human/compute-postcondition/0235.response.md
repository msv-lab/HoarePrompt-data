Functionality: **The function processes a sequence \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \) which is a permutation of \{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}, where \( n \) is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^4 \). For each test case, it determines the maximum and minimum values in the sequence. After processing all test cases, it prints the maximum and minimum values found for each sequence.**
