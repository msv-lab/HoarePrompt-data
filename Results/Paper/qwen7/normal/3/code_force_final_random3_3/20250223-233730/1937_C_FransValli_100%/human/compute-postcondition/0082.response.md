Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The variable `i` is initialized to 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - The variable `n` is used as the upper limit for the loop.

3. **Initial Values of `i` and `n`**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 1` and goes up to `n-1`, `i` should be 1 at the start of the loop.
   - `n` should be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once (since the loop runs from 1 to `n-1`).

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - `i` must be set to 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.

5. **Other Variables**:
   - `maxi`, `item`, `mini`, and `res` are not part of the loop head and their values do not affect whether the loop can execute. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
