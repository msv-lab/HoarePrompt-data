### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Setup**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the permutation `n`.

2. **Finding the Maximum Value (`maxi`)**:
   - The program iterates through the indices from 1 to `n-1` to find the index `maxi` such that `p[maxi]` is the maximum value in the permutation.
   - It compares `(p[maxi] | p[maxi])` with `(p[i] | p[i])` for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`. If the former is less than the latter, it updates `maxi` to `i`.
   - This step ensures that `maxi` points to the maximum value in the permutation.

3. **Finding the Minimum Value (`mini`)**:
   - The program initializes `arr` with `[0]`, which is the index of the minimum value (since the permutation is a valid permutation of `{0, 1, ..., n-1}`).
   - It iterates through the remaining indices from 1 to `n-1` and checks if `p[i]` is less than `p[maxi]` using the query `? maxi arr[0] maxi i`.
   - If `p[i]` is less than `p[maxi]`, it updates `arr` to contain only `i`; otherwise, it appends `i` to `arr`.
   - It then finds the minimum value in `arr` by comparing `p[mini]` with `p[item]` for each `item` in `arr`.

4. **Outputting the Result**:
   - The program prints the indices `maxi` and `mini` such that `p[maxi] ^ p[mini]` is maximized.
   - Since `maxi` is the maximum value and `mini` is the minimum value, `p[maxi] ^ p[mini]` will indeed be the maximum possible XOR value for any pair in the permutation.

5. **Query Limits**:
   - The program ensures that no more than `3n` queries are made, which is within the allowed limit.

Given the above steps, the program correctly identifies the indices `maxi` and `mini` such that `p[maxi] ^ p[mini]` is maximized and does so within the allowed query limit.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

**Correctness: **True**
