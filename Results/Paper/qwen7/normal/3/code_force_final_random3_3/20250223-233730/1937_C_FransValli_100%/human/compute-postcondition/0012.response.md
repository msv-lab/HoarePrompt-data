Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `maxi` is 1, and `res` is an input string, where the value of `res` is the input from the user.**

The code `res = input()` assigns the value of the user's input to the variable `res`. All other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `res` is an input string is maintained, and now `res` holds the actual input provided by the user.
