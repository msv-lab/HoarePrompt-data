Output State: **`maxi` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `res` is an input string, `arr` is updated based on the loop body, `mini` is updated based on the condition `res == '>'`**.

Explanation: The variable `res` is assigned the value of the input provided by the user. The values of `maxi`, `i`, `n`, `arr`, and `mini` remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `n` must be greater than 1 remains valid. The values of `arr` and `mini` depend on the loop body which is not provided, so they are left as "updated based on the loop body".
