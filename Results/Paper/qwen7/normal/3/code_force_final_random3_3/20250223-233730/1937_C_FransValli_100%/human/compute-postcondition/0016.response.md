Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\)
   - `n` must be at least 2
   - `i` is 2
   - `maxi` is 2
   - `res` is an input string, and it equals '<'

3. **Determine the Next Values for `i` and `n`**:
   - The loop condition is `for i in range(1, n)`. This means `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 3.
   - Since `i` is now 3, the loop will continue as long as `i < n`. Therefore, `n` must remain at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` needs to be updated to 3.
   - `n` remains at least 2.

5. **Post-Loop States**:
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `maxi` remains unchanged.
   - `res` remains unchanged.

Given these steps, the adjusted states for the next iteration of the loop are:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 3, `maxi` is 2, and `res` is an input string, and it equals '<'**
