Postcondition: `maxi` is 2, `i` is 2, `res` is an input string, `arr` is updated based on the loop body, `mini` is updated based on the condition `res == '>'`. If `res` is equal to '<', then `maxi` remains 2 and `i` remains 2. If there is no else part, the conditions for `mini` and `arr` remain as they were before the if statement.
