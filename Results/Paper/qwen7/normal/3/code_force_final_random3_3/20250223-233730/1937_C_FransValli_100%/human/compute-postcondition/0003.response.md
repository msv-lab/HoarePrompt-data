Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`.
   - The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute:**
   - For the loop `for i in range(1, n)` to execute, the value of `n` must be at least 2 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to but not including `n`).
   - The variable `i` will start at 1 and increment by 1 in each iteration.

3. **Adjust the Given States:**
   - The initial state given is: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` is an input integer, `maxi` is 0.
   - We need to adjust `n` to ensure the loop can execute, and `i` should start at 1.

Given these considerations, the adjusted state should be:

- `t` remains as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute.
- `i` should start at 1.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `maxi` is 0**
