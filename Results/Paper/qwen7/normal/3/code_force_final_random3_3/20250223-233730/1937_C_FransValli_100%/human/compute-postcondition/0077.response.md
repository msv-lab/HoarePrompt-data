Output State: **The loop has executed all its iterations, meaning `item` is now `arr[n-1]`, `mini` is the minimum value encountered in the array `arr` from index 1 to `n-1` based on the user's input ('>') comparisons during each iteration, and `res` is an input string reflecting the user's choice ('<' or '>') for each comparison.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `item` will be the last element in the array `arr`, `mini` will hold the smallest value among `arr[1]` to `arr[n-1]` as determined by the user's responses ('>'), and `res` will contain the last user input received.
