Output State: **maxi is n-1, i is n, res is an input string, arr is updated based on the loop body, mini is updated based on the condition res == '>' if the loop executes n-1 times.**

In natural language: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `maxi` will be set to `n-1`, since the loop runs from `i=1` to `i=n-1`. The variable `i` will be `n` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches `n`. The variable `res` will hold the last input received from the loop, and `arr` and `mini` will be updated according to the loop's body, but their exact states depend on the inputs received during each iteration.
