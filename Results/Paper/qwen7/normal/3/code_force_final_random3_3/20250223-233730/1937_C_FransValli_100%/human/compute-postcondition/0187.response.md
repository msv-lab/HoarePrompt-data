Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is less than `n`, `n` is unchanged, `arr` is [0, `i`], `maxi` is `n-1`, `res` is an input string, `mini` is updated based on the condition `res != '<'` if the loop executes `n-1` times, `res` is set to '=' as the if condition is met.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `arr`. Since `i` is less than `n`, appending `i` to `arr` results in `arr` becoming `[0, i]`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
