Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(1, n):` will start from `i = 1` and go up to `n-1`.
   - For the loop to start executing, `i` must be within the range defined by `range(1, n)`.
   - Specifically, `i` should be `1` at the start of the first iteration.

3. **Check the given initial state**:
   - `i` is currently equal to `n`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `res` is an input string (not relevant for the loop).
   - `maxi` is `n-1` (not directly relevant for the loop).
   - `arr` is `[0]` (not directly relevant for the loop).

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is currently `n`, it needs to be adjusted to `1` to start the loop.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
