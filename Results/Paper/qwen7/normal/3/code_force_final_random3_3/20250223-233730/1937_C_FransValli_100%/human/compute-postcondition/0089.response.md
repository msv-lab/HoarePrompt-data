Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variables `i` and `n`.
   - `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - `n` is the upper limit of the range.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `res` is an input string (no specific value given, but it hasn't changed).
   - `maxi` is 1 (since `res` is equal to '<' and no other changes are made in the else part).

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is currently 1 and `n` is greater than 1, `i` will be incremented to 2 in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1.
   - `res` and `maxi` remain unchanged.

Based on the above reasoning, the updated states are:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `res` is an input string, and `maxi` is 1**.
