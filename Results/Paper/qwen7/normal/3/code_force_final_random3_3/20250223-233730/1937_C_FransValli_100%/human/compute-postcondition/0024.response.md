Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values and conditions**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `n` must be at least 4.
   - `i` is equal to `n-1`.
   - `maxi` is `n-1`.
   - `res` is an input string where the value of `res` is '<' for each iteration from 1 to `n-1`.
   - `arr` is a list containing a single element 0.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = n-1`, the loop will run until `i` becomes less than `n`. For the loop to execute, `i` must be at least 1 (since the loop starts at 1) and less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `i` must be in the range from 1 to `n-1` for the loop to execute.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state of `i` and `n` to ensure the loop can execute. Specifically, `i` should be set to a value within the range `[1, n-1]` and `n` should be at least 4.

### Final State Adjustment

State: **`i` is 1 (or any value in the range [1, n-1]), `n` must be at least 4**
