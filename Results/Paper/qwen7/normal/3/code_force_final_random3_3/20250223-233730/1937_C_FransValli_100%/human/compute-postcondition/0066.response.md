Based on the initial state provided:

- `arr` must have at least 3 elements.
- `item` is `arr[2]`.
- `res` is an input string.
- `mini` is unchanged if `res` was `'> '` previously.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
```

Let's break it down:

1. `'?'` is a constant string.
2. `mini` is unchanged if `res` was `'> '` previously. Since no specific value for `res` is given, we assume `mini` retains its previous value if it was `'> '`.

The `item` is defined as `arr[2]`, so it is the third element of the list `arr`.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **'? [mini] [mini] [arr[2]] [arr[2]]'**
