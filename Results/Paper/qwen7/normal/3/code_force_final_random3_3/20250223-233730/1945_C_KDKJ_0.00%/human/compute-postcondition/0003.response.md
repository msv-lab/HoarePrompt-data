Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 300000\), `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', and `func_1()` has been called.**

Explanation: The function `func_1()` is called, which means that the function has been executed, but no specific changes to the variables `n` or `a` are mentioned in the provided code snippet. Therefore, the values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged, and the call to `func_1()` is noted.
