Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `left` is `S[1][0]`
   - `lsum` is `S[1][0] + S[1][1]`
   - `rsum` is `n - (S[0][0] + S[0][1]) - (S[1][0] + S[1][1])`
   - `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`
   - If `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum`, no changes occur.
   - Otherwise, `ans` is set to 1.
   - If the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i`, `ans` remains 1.
   - Otherwise, `ans` remains 1 as well.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`, and `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `i` becomes 2.
   - `left` becomes `S[2][0]`.
   - `lsum` becomes `S[2][0] + S[2][1]`.
   - `rsum` remains the same since it does not depend on `i`.
   - `right` becomes `S[-1][1] - S[2][1]`.

Therefore, the updated state for the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 2, `left` is `S[2][0]`, `lsum` is `S[2][0] + S[2][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[0][0] + S[0][1]) - (S[1][0] + S[1][1])`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[2][1]`**.
