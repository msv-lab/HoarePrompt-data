Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 300000, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', and `int(input())` is decremented by 1 from its previous value.**

Explanation: The function `func_1()` is called, but since no specific implementation of `func_1()` is provided, we cannot determine the exact changes it might make to the variables. However, we know that `int(input())` is decremented by 1 from its previous value. The initial state of `n` and `a` remains unchanged.
