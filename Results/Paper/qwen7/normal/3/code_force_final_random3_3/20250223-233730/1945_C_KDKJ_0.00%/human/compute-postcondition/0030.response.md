Output State: **`i` is 0; `left` is `S[0][0]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `S[i][0]` to the variable `left`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `left` becomes `S[0][0]`. The condition that `n` must be greater than 0 is still valid, but since no operations directly involve `n`, it remains unchanged.
