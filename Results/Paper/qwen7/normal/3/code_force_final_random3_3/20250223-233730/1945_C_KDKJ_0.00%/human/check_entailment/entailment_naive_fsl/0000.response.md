Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal position `i` for laying the road such that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program works:

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the prefix sums for both zeros (`0`s) and ones (`1`s) up to each house. This helps in determining the number of residents who would be on the left and right sides for any given position `i`.

2. **Satisfaction Check**: For each position `i`, it checks if the number of satisfied residents on both sides meets the requirement (`\lceil \frac{i}{2} \rceil` for the left side and `\lceil \frac{n-i}{2} \rceil` for the right side).

3. **Optimal Position Selection**: It selects the position `i` that minimizes the absolute difference from the center of the village (`\left| \frac{n}{2} - i \right|`) while ensuring the satisfaction condition is met.

4. **Edge Cases Handling**: The program handles edge cases such as when the road can be laid before the first house (position `0`) or after the last house (position `n-1`).

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and passes all the provided test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
