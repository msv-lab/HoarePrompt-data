Output State: **`i` is 2, `left` is `S[2][0]`, `lsum` is `S[2][0] + S[2][1] + S[i][0] + S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[0][0] + S[0][1] + S[1][0] + S[1][1] + S[2][0] + S[2][1])`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the code snippet, the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
