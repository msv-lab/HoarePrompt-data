### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` processes a binary string `a` of length `n` and calculates an index `ans` that satisfies certain conditions related to the counts of '0's and '1's in the string.
   - It uses a list `S` to store the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's up to each position in the string `a`.
   - For each position `i` in the string, it checks if the counts of '0's and '1's on both sides of the potential road placement meet the requirement that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.
   - If the conditions are met, it updates `ans` to the current position `i` if it is closer to the middle of the village (`n/2`) than the previously found `ans`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()` once.
   - This ensures that for each test case, the logic in `func_1()` is applied correctly to find the optimal position for the road.

3. **Overall Program Logic:**
   - The program correctly processes each test case by calling `func_1()` for each test case.
   - The logic in `func_1()` is designed to find the optimal position for the road based on the given conditions.
   - The output for each test case is the position `ans` calculated by `func_1()`.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The constraints and edge cases (such as the minimum length of the string being 3) are handled appropriately within the functions.
   - The program correctly handles the input and output format as specified in the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem and meets all the specified requirements.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
