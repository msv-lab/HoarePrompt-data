Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `int(input())` must be a positive integer.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 300000\).
   - `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'.
   - `func_1()` has been called.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since the loop condition depends on `int(input())`, we need to ensure that `int(input())` is a positive integer for the loop to execute again.
   - We do not know the exact value of `int(input())` from the given information, but we know it must be a positive integer.

5. **Formulate the New State:**
   - `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `a` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `func_1()` has already been called, so we don't need to adjust this state.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 300000\), `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', and `int(input())` must be a positive integer.**
