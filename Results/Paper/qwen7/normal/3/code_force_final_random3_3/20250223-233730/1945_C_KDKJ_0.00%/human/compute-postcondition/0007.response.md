Output State: `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 300000, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', and `func_1()` has been called three times.

Explanation: The loop runs for a number of times specified by the user input, which is decremented by 1 each time the loop iterates. After the loop executes all its iterations, `func_1()` will have been called as many times as the initial input value minus the number of iterations it took to fully execute the loop. Given that the loop executes until the input value reaches zero, if it executed 3 times, it means the initial input was 3 or more, and now it is 0. Therefore, `func_1()` would have been called exactly the number of times equal to the initial input value.
