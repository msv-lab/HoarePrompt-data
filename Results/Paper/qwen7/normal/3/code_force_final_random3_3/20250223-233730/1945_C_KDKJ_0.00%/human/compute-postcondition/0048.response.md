Output State: **`i` is 1, `left` is `S[1][0]`, `lsum` is `S[1][0] + S[1][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[0][0] + S[0][1]) - (S[1][0] + S[1][1])`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `rsum` to `n - lsum`. Initially, `lsum` is defined as `S[1][0] + S[1][1]`. After executing `rsum = n - lsum`, `rsum` now holds the value of `n - (S[1][0] + S[1][1])`. All other variables (`i`, `left`, `lsum`, `right`) remain unchanged.
