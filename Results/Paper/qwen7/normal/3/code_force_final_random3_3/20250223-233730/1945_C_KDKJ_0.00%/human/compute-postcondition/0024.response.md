Output State: **`a` is a non-empty string consisting only of '0' and '1', but one character shorter than before; `S` is a list containing three lists `[x, y]`, `[x+1, y+1]`, and `[x, y]`; either `x` is increased by 1 if the last character of `a` is '0', or `y` is increased by 1 if the first character of `a` is '1'.**

Explanation: The code `S.append([x, y])` adds another list `[x, y]` to the list `S`. Initially, `S` contained two lists `[x, y]` and `[x+1, y+1]`. After executing the code, `S` now contains three lists: `[x, y]`, `[x+1, y+1]`, and the newly appended `[x, y]`. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged unless modified by the condition specified earlier.
