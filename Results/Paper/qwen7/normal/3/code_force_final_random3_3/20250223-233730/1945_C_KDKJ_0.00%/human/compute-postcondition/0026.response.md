Output State: The final state of `a` is an empty string since the loop processes each character of the initial string until it is completely consumed. `S` is a list containing all intermediate states of `[x, y]` for each iteration of the loop, where `x` is incremented by 1 if the current character is '0', and `y` is incremented by 1 if the current character is '1'. Specifically, `S` will contain a list of sublists, with each sublist corresponding to the values of `x` and `y` after processing each character of the original string `a`.

In other words, `S` will be a list of pairs, where each pair represents the counts of '0's and '1's encountered up to that point in the string `a`, starting from the beginning and ending with the counts of the entire string.
