Postcondition: `i` is 0, `left` is `S[0][0]`, `lsum` is `S[0][0] + S[0][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[0][0] + S[0][1])`, the left value times 2 is greater than or equal to the left sum, and the right value times 2 is greater than or equal to the right sum, and the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`.
