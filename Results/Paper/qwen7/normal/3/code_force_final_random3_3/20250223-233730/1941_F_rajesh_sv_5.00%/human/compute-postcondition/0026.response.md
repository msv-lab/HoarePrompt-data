Postcondition: `max_diff` is equal to `diff` if `diff > max_diff`, otherwise `max_diff` remains `-inf`. `next_max_diff` is equal to `diff` if `diff > next_max_diff`, otherwise it remains unchanged. `index` is `i` if `diff > max_diff`, otherwise it remains `None`. `diff` is `A[i] - A[i - 1]`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `A`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `D`, and `F` retain their original values from `func_4()`.
