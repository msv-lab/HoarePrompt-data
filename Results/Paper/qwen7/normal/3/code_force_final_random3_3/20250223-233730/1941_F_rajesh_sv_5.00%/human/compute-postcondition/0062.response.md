Postcondition: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `h` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `right - f[0]` - 1 and `h` is not equal to `l`, `l` is less than `h`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `mid` is updated to `mid + 1` and `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `mid` is updated to `h`.**
