Output State: **`l` is equal to the index returned by bisect_right(D, left - f), `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `f` is the next element in `F`.**

Explanation: The variable `l` is updated to the index returned by `bisect_right(D, left - f)`, which means `l` now points to the position in list `D` where the value `left - f` would be inserted to keep the list sorted. The variable `ans` is updated based on the new value of `l`, considering the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`. The variable `f` remains unchanged as it is described as the next element in `F`.
