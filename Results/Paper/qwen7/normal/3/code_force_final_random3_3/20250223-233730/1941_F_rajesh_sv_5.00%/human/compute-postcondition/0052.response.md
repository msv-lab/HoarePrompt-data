Output State: **`mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `h` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `right - f[0]` - 1 and `h` is not equal to `l`.**

Explanation: The code `mid = l + (h - l) // 2` updates the value of `mid` to be the midpoint between `l` and `h`. However, the values of `l` and `h` remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, the updated value of `mid` is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`, while `h` remains the same as its initial state.
