Output State: `l` is greater than or equal to `h`.

This means that after all the iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `l` will be greater than or equal to the value of `h`. This indicates that the search range defined by `l` and `h` has narrowed down such that no more elements can satisfy the condition specified within the loop, leading to the termination of the loop.
