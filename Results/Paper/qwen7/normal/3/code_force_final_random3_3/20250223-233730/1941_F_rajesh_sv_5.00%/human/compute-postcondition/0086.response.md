Postcondition: `l` is an integer, `h` is an integer, and `mid` is an integer. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` becomes `mid + 1`, `h` remains greater than `l`, `mid` is recalculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. Otherwise, `l` remains less than `h`, `mid` is recalculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, and `h` becomes `mid`.
