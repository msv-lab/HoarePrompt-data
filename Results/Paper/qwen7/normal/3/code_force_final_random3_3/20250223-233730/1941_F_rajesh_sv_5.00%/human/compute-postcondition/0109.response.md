Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `l` is `mid + 1`, `l` must be less than `h`. The difference between `mid_sum` and `left` is less than the difference between `right` and `mid_next_sum`.**

Explanation: The variable `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. All other variables (`mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `mid`, and the condition about the differences) remain unchanged from their previous states.
