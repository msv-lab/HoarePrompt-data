Postcondition: **After all iterations, `l` and `h` define the boundaries of the search range where the optimal solution is found, `ans` contains the best result obtained, `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` reflect the sums `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f` for the last valid midpoint `mid`, and `f` is the last element in `F` (denoted as `f_next`) processed by the loop. If `l` equals `h`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between `ans` and `max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f)`, `l` is equal to `h`, `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` remain unchanged, `h` is `l - 1`, and `left` and `right` retain their values from the final iteration.**
