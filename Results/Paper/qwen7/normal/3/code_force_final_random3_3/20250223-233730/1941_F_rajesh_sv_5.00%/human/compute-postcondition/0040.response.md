Output State: **`l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F[0]`, assuming `F` is a list and `D` is sorted.**

Explanation: The code `l = bisect_right(D, left - f)` uses the `bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module to find the insertion point for `left - f` in the sorted list `D`. Since `F` must contain at least one element, `f` refers to the first element of `F`, i.e., `F[0]`. The variable `l` is assigned the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
