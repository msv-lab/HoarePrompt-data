Output State: **`l` must be less than `h`; `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`; `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.**

This means that the value of `mid` remains the same as before, which is `l + (h - l) // 2`. The new variables `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are assigned the values `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f`, respectively. The conditions and relationships between `l`, `h`, and `mid` remain unchanged.
