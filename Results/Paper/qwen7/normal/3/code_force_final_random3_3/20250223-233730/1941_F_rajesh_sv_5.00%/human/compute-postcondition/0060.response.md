Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `h` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `right - f[0]` - 1 and `h` is not equal to `l`, `l` is `mid + 1`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is updated to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is updated to `D[mid + 1] + f**.

Explanation: The line `l = mid + 1` updates the value of `l` to be `mid + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
