Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `h` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `right - f[0]` - 1, `l` must be less than `h`, and `h` is now equal to `mid`.**

Explanation: The code `h = mid` simply assigns the current value of `mid` to `h`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
