To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop condition and the variables involved in the condition.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `l < h`.
2. **Variables Involved in the Loop Condition**: The variables `l` and `h` are the ones that directly affect the loop condition `l < h`.

Given the postconditions and the loop body, we know:
- `l` is an integer less than `h`.
- `mid` is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`.
- `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`.
- `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.

The loop updates `l` and `h` based on the comparison between `mid_sum - left` and `right - mid_next_sum`:
- If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is set to `mid + 1` and `h` must be greater than `l`.
- Otherwise, `h` is set to `mid`.

### Adjusting the States:

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `l < h` must still hold true. Therefore, we need to ensure that `l` and `h` are such that `l < h` remains valid.

- If `l` is set to `mid + 1`, then `l` must be greater than `mid` (which is `l + (h - l) // 2`). This implies that `h` must be greater than `l` to maintain the condition `l < h`.
- If `h` is set to `mid`, then `h` must be greater than `l` to maintain the condition `l < h`.

In both cases, the condition `l < h` must be satisfied.

### Conclusion:

The states that need to be adjusted are `l` and `h` to ensure that `l < h` holds true. Specifically, either `l` should be set to `mid + 1` with `h > l` or `h` should be set to `mid` with `h > l`.

State: **`l` is an integer less than `h`, and `h` must be greater than `l`**
