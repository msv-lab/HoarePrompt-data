Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `h` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `right - f[0]` - 1 and `h` is not equal to `l`, `l` is less than `h`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is updated to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is updated to `D[mid + 1] + f**.

Explanation: The code simply reassigns the values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` to `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f` respectively. Since these assignments do not affect the values of `h`, `l`, or `mid`, those variables retain their original conditions and values.
