Postcondition: `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`. If `l` is updated to `mid + 1` and `l` is still less than `h`, the difference between `mid_sum` and `left` is less than the difference between `right` and `mid_next_sum`. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid`.
