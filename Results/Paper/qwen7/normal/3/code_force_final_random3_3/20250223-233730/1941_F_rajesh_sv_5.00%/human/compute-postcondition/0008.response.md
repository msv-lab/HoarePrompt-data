Output State: `testcases` must be greater than or equal to 3.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `testcases` must be at least 3. This is because the loop runs as long as `testcases` is greater than 0, and we know it ran at least 3 times, so `testcases` had to start at a value of 3 or higher.
