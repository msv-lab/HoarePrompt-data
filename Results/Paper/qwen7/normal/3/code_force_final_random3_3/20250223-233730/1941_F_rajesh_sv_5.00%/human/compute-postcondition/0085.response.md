Output State: **`l` must be less than `h`; `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`; `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`; `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`; `h` is `mid`.**

Explanation: The code `h = mid` updates the value of `h` to be equal to `mid`. All other variables (`l`, `mid`, `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, and `f`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
