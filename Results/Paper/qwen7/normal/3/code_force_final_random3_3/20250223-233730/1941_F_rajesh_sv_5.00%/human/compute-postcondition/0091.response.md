Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `l` is `mid + 1`, and `h` is greater than `l`.**

Explanation: The variable `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. All other variables (`mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `mid`, `h`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
