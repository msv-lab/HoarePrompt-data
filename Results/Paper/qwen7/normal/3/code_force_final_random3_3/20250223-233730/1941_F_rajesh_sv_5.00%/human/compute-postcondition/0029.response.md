Output State: **`max_diff` is equal to `diff`, `next_max_diff` is equal to `diff` if `diff > next_max_diff`, otherwise it remains unchanged, `index` is `i` if `diff > max_diff`, otherwise it remains `None`, `diff` is updated to `A[i] - A[i - 1]`, `i` is updated to `i + 1`, and `A`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `D`, and `F` retain their original values from `func_4()`**.

This means that the `max_diff` is now set to the current value of `diff`. The `next_max_diff` remains unchanged unless `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`. Similarly, `index` remains unchanged unless `diff` is greater than `max_diff`. The `diff` is updated to the new difference `A[i] - A[i - 1]`, and `i` is incremented by 1. All other variables (`A`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `D`, and `F`) retain their original values from the function `func_4()`.
