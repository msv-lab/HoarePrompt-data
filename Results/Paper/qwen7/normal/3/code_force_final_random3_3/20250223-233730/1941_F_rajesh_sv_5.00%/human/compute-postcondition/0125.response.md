Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, and `l` is `mid + 1`.**

The code `l = mid + 1` assigns the value of `mid + 1` to the variable `l`. The values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `l` and retains the original values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum`.
