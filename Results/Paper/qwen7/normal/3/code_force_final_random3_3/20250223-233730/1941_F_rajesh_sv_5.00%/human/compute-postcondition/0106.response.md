Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `l` must be less than `h`**

Explanation: The code assigns `D[mid] + f` to `mid_sum` and `D[mid + 1] + f` to `mid_next_sum`. The values of `mid`, `l`, and `h` remain unchanged from their initial state, with the condition that `l` must be less than `h`.
