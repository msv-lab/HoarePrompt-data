Postcondition: `l` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `h` remains as `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `f` is the next element in `F`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, and `left` and `right` must be chosen such that there is at least one element in `D` between `left - f` and `right - f`. Additionally, `(mid_sum - left >= right - mid_next_sum)`.
