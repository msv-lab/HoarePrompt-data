Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `l` and `h`.

2. **Understand the Condition for the Loop**: The loop condition is `l < h`. For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `l < h` must be true.

3. **Current State Before the Loop**:
   - `h` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `right - f[0]` - 1.
   - `l` is not specified in the given state, but it is implied to be some initial value.

4. **Determine the Necessary Adjustments**:
   - Since `h` is already defined as the index of the first element in `D` that satisfies the condition, no adjustment is needed for `h`.
   - To ensure `l < h`, `l` must be less than `h`. If `l` is not less than `h` initially, it needs to be adjusted to be less than `h`.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `l` to ensure it is less than `h`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`h` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `right - f[0]` - 1, `l` must be less than `h`**
