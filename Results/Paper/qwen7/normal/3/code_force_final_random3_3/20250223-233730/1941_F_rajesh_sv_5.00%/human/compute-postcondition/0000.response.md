Output State: **`testcases' is the result of calling func_3()`.**

Explanation: The code `testcases = func_3()` assigns the return value of the function `func_3()` to the variable `testcases`. However, since the function `func_3()` is not defined, we cannot determine its exact return value. Therefore, the only information we can provide is that `testcases` is the result of calling `func_3()`. All other variables and their initial conditions remain unchanged.
