Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, `x` will be equal to `n // 2`, `ans` will be the sum of `s[x]` (repeated twice) for each iteration from 0 to `n // 2 - 1`, and `j` will be equal to `n // 2 - 1`.**

This means that `x` will reach half the value of `n` (rounded down), `ans` will accumulate the doubled value of each character in the string `s` from index `x` up to `n // 2 - 1`, and `j` will be the final value it reaches after the loop completes, which is `n // 2 - 1`.
