Postcondition: `t` must be at least 1, `n` is an integer. If `n` is 1, then `i` is 0. Otherwise, `i` is 1, `ans` is a string consisting of 'A' repeated 2 * (n // 2 - 1) times followed by 'S' repeated (n // 2 - 1) times, `x` is n // 2, `j` is n // 2 - 1, and `n` is either an even integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 8 or an odd integer greater than or equal to 3.
