Output State: **`t` must be less than `n // 2`, `i` is `t`, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is `s[x] * 2`, `x` is 0, `j` is less than `n // 2 - 1`**

Explanation: The code `ans += s[x] * 2` appends `s[x] * 2` to the string `ans`. Given that `x` is 0, `ans` becomes `s[0] * 2`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
