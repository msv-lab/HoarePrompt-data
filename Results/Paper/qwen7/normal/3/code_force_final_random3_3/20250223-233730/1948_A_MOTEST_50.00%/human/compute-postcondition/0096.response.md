Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(n // 2 - 1)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 1.
   - `n` is an odd integer.
   - `ans` is updated as `ans` + 2 * `s[x]`.
   - `x` is increased by 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `j < n // 2 - 1`.

4. **Calculate the new value of `j`**: Since `j` starts at 1 and the loop increments `j` by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 2.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `n // 2 - 1`. Given that `j` is now 2, `n` must be such that `2 < n // 2 - 1`. This simplifies to `n > 5` because `n // 2 - 1` must be greater than 2.

6. **Adjust the state**: The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`. Therefore, we need to update these variables accordingly.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `j` is 2.
- `n` is an odd integer greater than 5.

Since the state of `ans` and `x` are not part of the loop head, they remain unchanged.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`j` is 2, `n` is an odd integer greater than 5**.
