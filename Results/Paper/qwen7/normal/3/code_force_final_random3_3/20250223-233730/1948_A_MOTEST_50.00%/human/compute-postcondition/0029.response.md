Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 1, `ans` is 'AAASSS', `x` is 2, `j` is 2**

Explanation: The code `ans += s[x] * 2` updates the string `ans` by appending twice the character at index `x` of the string `s`. Given that `x` is 2, the character at index 2 of `ans` (which is 'A') is appended twice, changing `ans` from 'AAAS' to 'AAASSS'. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, `x`, and `j`) remain unchanged.
