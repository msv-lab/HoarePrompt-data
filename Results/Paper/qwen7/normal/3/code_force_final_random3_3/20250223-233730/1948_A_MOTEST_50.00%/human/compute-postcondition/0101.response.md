Output State: **`j` is 3, `n` is an odd integer greater than 8, `ans` is increased by 4 times the value of `s[x]`, `x` is increased by 1**

Step-by-step explanation:
- Initially, `j` is 3.
- `n` is an odd integer greater than 8.
- `ans` is increased by 4 times the value of `s[x]`.
- `x` is increased by 1.

After executing `x += 1`, the value of `x` is increased by 1. Since the initial value of `x` was not specified, we only know that it has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
