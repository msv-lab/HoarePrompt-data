Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 50; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `s` is a string containing the uppercase ASCII characters from 'A' to 'Z'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    if n == 1:
        print('NO')
    else:
        ans = ''
        x = 0
        if n % 2 == 0:
            for j in range(n // 2):
                ans += s[x] * 2
                x += 1
        else:
            ans, x = 'AAA', 1
            for j in range(n // 2 - 1):
                ans += s[x] * 2
                x += 1
        print('YES')
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `t` must be at least 1, `n` is an integer. If `n` is 1, then `i` is 0. Otherwise, `i` is 1, `ans` is a string consisting of 'A' repeated 2 * (n // 2 - 1) times followed by 'S' repeated (n // 2 - 1) times, `x` is n // 2, `j` is n // 2 - 1, and `n` is either an even integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 8 or an odd integer greater than or equal to 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `t` must be at least 1, `i` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer. If `n` equals 1, the conditions remain the same. Otherwise, `t` must be at least 1, `i` is at least 0, `n` must be at least 3 and an odd number, `ans` is 'A' repeated `2 * (n // 2 - 1)` times, `x` is `n // 2 + 1`, and `j` is less than `n // 2 - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` must be at least 1, `i` is `t`, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is 'A' repeated `2 * (n // 2 - 1)` times, `x` is `n // 2 + 1`, `j` is less than `n // 2 - 1. If `n` equals 1, the function does nothing. Otherwise, if `t` is less than `n // 2`, `i` becomes `t + n // 2`, `n` is an odd integer greater than or equal to 11, `ans` is increased by `2 * s[x]` for each of the `n // 2 - 1` iterations, `x` is increased by 1 after each iteration, and `j` is `n // 2 - 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
