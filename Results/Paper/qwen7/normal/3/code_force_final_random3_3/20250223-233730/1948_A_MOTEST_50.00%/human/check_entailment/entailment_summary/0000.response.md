Reasoning:
- The program correctly handles the case where `n` is 1 by printing 'NO'.
- For even values of `n`, the program constructs a string with pairs of letters 'A' up to `n//2` times, which ensures that every character except the first and last is a special character.
- For odd values of `n`, the program starts with 'AAA' and then adds pairs of letters 'A' up to `n//2 - 1` times, ensuring that the first three characters and the remaining characters (except the last one) are special.
- The program prints 'YES' before printing the constructed string, which is consistent with the problem statement.
- The constructed strings are within the allowed length limit of 200 characters.
- The program logic is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
