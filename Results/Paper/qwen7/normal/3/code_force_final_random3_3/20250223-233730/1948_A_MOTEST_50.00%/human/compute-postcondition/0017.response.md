Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head defines the variables that control the loop execution. In this case, the loop variable is `j`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the start of the loop**: From the given information, we know:
   - `t` must be at least 1.
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `x` is now `x_prev + 2`.
   - `j` is `j_prev + 1` and must be less than `n // 2`.

3. **Understand the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n // 2`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was `j_prev + 1` and it must be less than `n // 2`. Therefore, for the next iteration, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 (making it `j_prev + 2`) and checked against `n // 2`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to update the state such that `j` is `j_prev + 2` and still less than `n // 2`.

Given these points, the updated state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `t` must be at least 1.
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `x` remains `x_prev + 2`.
- `j` is now `j_prev + 2` and must be less than `n // 2`.

So, the final state is:

**State: **`ans` is increased by 2 times the value of `s[x]`, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be at least 2, `x` is now `x_prev + 2`, `j` is `j_prev + 2` and must be less than `n // 2`**
