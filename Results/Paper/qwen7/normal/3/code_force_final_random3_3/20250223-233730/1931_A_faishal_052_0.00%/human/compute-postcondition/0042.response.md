Output State: **The loop will execute exactly 3 times based on the provided conditions. After all iterations, `arr` will contain the elements `[1, 26, 26]` if `lex` is between 27 and 51. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` will contain `[1, 1]`. If `lex` is 52 or greater, `arr` will remain unchanged and still contain `[1, 26]` as it did after 2 iterations.**

This means that after the loop completes its 3 iterations:
- If `lex` was initially between 27 and 51, `arr` will end up with the elements `[1, 26, 26]`.
- If `lex` was initially less than or equal to 26, `arr` will end up with the elements `[1, 1]`.
- If `lex` was initially 52 or greater, `arr` will end up with the elements `[1, 26]`, which is the state after 2 iterations since no further changes can be made.
