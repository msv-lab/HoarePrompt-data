Output State: **`lex` is an integer, and `arr` is a list containing the elements [1, 26]**.

Explanation: Initially, `arr` contains the value 1 if `lex` is less than or equal to 25, or remains unchanged and contains the element 26 if `lex` is between 26 and 51. After executing `arr.append(26)`, the list `arr` will contain both 1 and 26. Therefore, the updated state is that `lex` is an integer, and `arr` is a list containing the elements [1, 26].
