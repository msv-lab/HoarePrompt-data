Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for k in range(3)`. The variables involved in this loop head are `k`.

2. **Determine the current state of `k`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is 1.

3. **Understand the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `k` is less than 3.

4. **Calculate the new value of `k`**: Since `k` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, after the first iteration (`k` is 1), the next value of `k` will be 2.

5. **Check if the loop should continue**: With `k` now being 2, the condition `k < 3` is still true, so the loop will execute one more time.

6. **Adjust the state**: We need to update the state of `k` to reflect its new value after the next iteration.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`arr` is [1, 13, 26], `k` is 2, `k` must be less than 3**
