Output State: **`k` is 2, `arr` is a list containing 1, `lex` is `lex` - 1, `j` is 2**

Explanation: The variable `lex` is decremented by 1, but since `lex` was not initialized or given a specific value before the operation, it remains as `lex - 1`. The values of `k`, `arr`, and `j` remain unchanged.
