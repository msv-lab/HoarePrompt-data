Output State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is adjusted based on its initial value (either `lex - 1` if `lex <= 26`, or `lex - 26` if `lex > 26`), and `arr` contains the elements [26, 26, 26].**

Natural Language Description: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `j` will be 2 since the loop runs for 2 iterations as defined by the range(2). The variable `lex` will be adjusted based on its initial value; if it was initially less than or equal to 26, it will be `lex - 1` (since the loop appends 1 once when `lex <= 26`). If `lex` was greater than 26, it will be `lex - 26 * 2` (since the loop appends 26 twice when `lex > 26`). The list `arr` will contain three elements, all of which are 26, as the loop appends 26 in each iteration regardless of the value of `lex`.
