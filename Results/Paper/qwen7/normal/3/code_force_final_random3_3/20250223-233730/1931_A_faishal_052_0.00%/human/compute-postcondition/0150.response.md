Output State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is adjusted based on its initial value (either `lex - 1` if `lex <= 26`, or `lex - 26` if `lex > 26`), and `arr` contains the elements [26, 26, 26, lex]**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `lex` to the list `arr`. The value of `j` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `lex` is adjusted based on its initial value, either `lex - 1` if `lex <= 26`, or `lex - 26` if `lex > 26`. The list `arr` now contains the elements [26, 26, 26] plus the new element `lex`.
