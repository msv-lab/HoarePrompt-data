Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, printing 'a m z' and setting `k` to 2. The list `arr` remains unchanged as [1, 13, 26].

In more detail, after the loop completes all three iterations, the variable `k` will be set to 2 (since the loop runs from 0 to 2, inclusive). The list `arr` stays as [1, 13, 26] because the loop does not modify it. The loop prints the characters corresponding to the values in `arr` plus 96, which results in 'a', 'm', and 'z' being printed in sequence.
