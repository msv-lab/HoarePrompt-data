The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `cases`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 3, `arr` is a sorted list with the last element being 0, and `lex` is 0. Since the loop iterates from `k=0` to `k=2`, it will run 3 times in total. After all iterations, `k` will be 3, and the list `arr` and `lex` remain unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `cases`. Given that the loop runs from `k=0` to `k=2`, `cases` must be 3 for the loop to complete its iterations. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 3 (the next value after 2) and `cases` should still be 3.

State: **`k` is 3, `arr` is a sorted list with the last element being 0, `lex` is 0, `i` is 3, `cases` is 3**
