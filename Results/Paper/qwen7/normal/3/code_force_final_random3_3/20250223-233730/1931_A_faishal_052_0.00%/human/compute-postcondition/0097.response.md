Output State: **`k` is 2, `arr` is a list containing up to 52 elements, and `lex` is 0.**

Explanation: The loop runs for a maximum of 52 iterations because it increments `j` from 0 to 1, and the loop condition `j in range(2)` allows for 2 iterations. Each iteration either appends `1` to `arr` and decreases `lex` by 1, or appends `26` to `arr` and decreases `lex` by 26. After 52 iterations, `lex` will be reduced to 0, and `arr` will contain a total of 52 elements, either `1`s or `26`s depending on the original value of `lex`.
