Output State: **`lex` is an integer between 27 and 51, `arr` is a list containing the element 26**.

Explanation: The initial state is that `lex` is an integer greater than 26 and greater than or equal to 52. After executing `lex = lex - 26`, `lex` is reduced by 26. Since `lex` was initially between 27 and 51 (inclusive of 52), subtracting 26 from it results in `lex` being between 27 - 26 = 1 and 51 - 26 = 25. However, since `lex` could not have been exactly 52 (as it would have been reduced to 26, which is not in the range), `lex` is now an integer between 27 and 51. The list `arr` remains unchanged.
