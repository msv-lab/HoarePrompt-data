Output State: **`k` is 2, `arr` is a list containing [2, 26], `lex` is `lex - 26`, `j` is 1**

Explanation: The variable `lex` is decremented by 26. Since the initial value of `lex` is not specified, it remains as `lex - 26`. The other variables (`k`, `arr`, and `j`) are not affected by this operation.
