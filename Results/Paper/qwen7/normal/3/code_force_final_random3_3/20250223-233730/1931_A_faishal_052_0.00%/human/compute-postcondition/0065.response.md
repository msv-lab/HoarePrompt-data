Output State: **`k` is 2, `arr` is [26], `lex` is an input integer greater than 26 and less than 52, `j` must be between 0 and 1 inclusive.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(26)` adds the integer 26 to the list `arr`. The other variables (`k`, `lex`, and `j`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `k` is still 2, `arr` now contains the element 26, `lex` is still an input integer greater than 26 and less than 52, and `j` must still be between 0 and 1 inclusive.
