Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, printing 'a m z' and `k` is 2, `k` must be less than 3.

After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `k` will be 2 (since the loop runs from 0 to 2, inclusive). The list `arr` remains unchanged as no modifications were made to it within the loop. The loop prints the characters corresponding to the values in `arr` plus 96, which results in 'a', 'm', and 'z'.
