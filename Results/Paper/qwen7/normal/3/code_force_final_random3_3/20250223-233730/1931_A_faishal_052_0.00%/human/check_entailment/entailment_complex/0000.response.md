Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of `lex`**: The program attempts to break down `lex` into parts that correspond to the first two letters of the word, but it does so in a way that doesn't accurately reflect the possible values of `lex`.

2. **Incorrect Construction of `arr`**: The logic for constructing `arr` is flawed. For instance, it incorrectly handles cases where `lex` is greater than 26 but less than 52, and it does not properly account for the full range of possible values for `lex`.

3. **Sorting and Printing**: The sorting step and subsequent printing of characters do not align with the problem requirements. The program prints 'a' three times for each case, which is not correct.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest word that can produce the given encoded value. This involves determining the largest possible values for the last character first and then working backwards to determine the first two characters.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        
        # Determine the last character
        last_char = lex % 26
        if last_char == 0:
            last_char = 26
            lex -= 26
        
        # Determine the second last character
        second_last_char = (lex - last_char) // 26
        
        # Determine the first character
        first_char = 1 if second_last_char == 0 else 26
        
        # Print the result
        print(f"{chr(first_char + 96)}{chr(second_last_char + 96)}{chr(last_char + 96)}")

# Example usage:
func()
```

Given the above reasoning, the original program is incorrect. Therefore:

Correctness: **False**
