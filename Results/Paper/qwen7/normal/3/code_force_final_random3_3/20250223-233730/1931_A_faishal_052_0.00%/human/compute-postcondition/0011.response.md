Output State: **`lex` is an integer greater than 26 and less than 52; `arr` is a list containing the element 26**.

The code `arr.append(26)` adds the integer 26 to the list `arr`. Since `lex` was initially an integer greater than 26 and less than 52, its value remains unchanged. Therefore, `lex` is still an integer greater than 26 and less than 52, and `arr` now contains the element 26.
