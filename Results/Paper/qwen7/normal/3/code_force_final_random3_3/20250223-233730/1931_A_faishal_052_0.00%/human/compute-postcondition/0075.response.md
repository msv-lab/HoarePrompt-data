Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies `j` as the variable being iterated over. Therefore, the only variable that can be adjusted is `j`.

2. **Determine the Range of `j`**: The loop runs from `0` to `1` (inclusive), meaning `j` starts at `0` and increments by `1` until it reaches `1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `k` is `2`.
   - `arr` is a list that was adjusted based on the value of `lex`.
   - `lex` is adjusted accordingly.
   - `j` must be between `0` and `1` inclusive.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` must be between `0` and `1` inclusive, after the first iteration (`j = 0`), the next iteration will set `j` to `1`.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `k` remains `2`.
- `arr` remains as it was adjusted in the previous iteration.
- `lex` remains as it was adjusted in the previous iteration.
- `j` changes from `0` to `1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`k` is 2, `arr` is a list, `lex` is adjusted accordingly, `j` is 1**.
