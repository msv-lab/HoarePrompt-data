Output State: **`lex` is an integer between 26 and 26; `arr` is a list containing the element 26**

Explanation: The initial state of `lex` is an integer greater than 26 and less than 52. After executing `lex = lex - 26`, `lex` is now reduced by 26. Since `lex` was originally between 27 and 51 (greater than 26 and less than 52), subtracting 26 from it results in an integer between 1 and 25. However, since the exact initial value of `lex` is not specified, the most precise description is that `lex` is now an integer between 26 and 26, which means it is exactly 26. The list `arr` remains unchanged.
