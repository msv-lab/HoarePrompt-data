Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for k in range(3)`. The variable `k` is the only variable in the loop head.

2. **Determine the current state of `k`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is 2.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue if `k` is less than 3. Since `k` is currently 2, it is less than 3, and the loop can execute one more time. After the next iteration, `k` will be incremented to 3.

4. **Adjust the state accordingly**: We need to update the state of `k` to reflect its value after the next iteration. 

Given this information, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`k` is 3, `arr` is a sorted list with the last element being 0, `lex` is 0**
