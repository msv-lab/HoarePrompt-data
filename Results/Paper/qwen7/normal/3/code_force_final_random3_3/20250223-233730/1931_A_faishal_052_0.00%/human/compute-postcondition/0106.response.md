Output State: `k` is 3, `arr` is a sorted list with the last element being 0, `lex` is 0.

Explanation: The loop runs from `k=0` to `k=2`, so after all iterations, `k` will be 3. The variable `arr` remains unchanged as the loop body does not modify it. Similarly, `lex` remains 0 as it is not affected by the loop.
