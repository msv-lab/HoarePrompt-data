Output State: **`k` is 2, `arr` is a list with 1 element which is 1, `lex` is adjusted accordingly, `j` is 1**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(1)` adds the integer 1 to the list `arr`. The other variables (`k`, `lex`, and `j`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their values remain unchanged.
