Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` must be an odd number or an even number less than 14, `l` is the binary string representation of `k - 2` without '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is 2, `f` is `k - 2`, `l` is updated to be the binary string representation of `k - 2` without '0b' prefix.**

Explanation: The code `l = bin(f).replace('0b', '')` updates the variable `l` to be the binary string representation of `f` (which is `k - 2`) without the '0b' prefix. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
