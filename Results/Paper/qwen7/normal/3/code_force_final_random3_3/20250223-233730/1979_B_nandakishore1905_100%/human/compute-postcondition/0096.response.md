Postcondition: `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2, then `k` remains unchanged, if `k` is odd, then `k` remains unchanged, if `k` is even and at least 14, then `k` is adjusted to be `k - 14`. `l` is the binary string representation of `k - 2`, `p` is the length of `l`, and `f` is `k - 14`. If `k` is odd or even less than 14, `l` is the binary string representation of `k - 2` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is 2, and `f` is 0.
