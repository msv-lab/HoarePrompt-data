Output: **1**

Explanation: The initial state only provides information about the variables `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k`. However, the `print(1)` statement directly prints the integer 1 without referencing any of these variables. Therefore, regardless of the values of `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k`, the output will simply be the integer 1.
