Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `k % 2 != 0`, then `k` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `k` is at least 14, `l` is the binary string representation of `k - 2` (without the '0b' prefix), `p` is the length of `l`, and `f` is `k - 14`.**
