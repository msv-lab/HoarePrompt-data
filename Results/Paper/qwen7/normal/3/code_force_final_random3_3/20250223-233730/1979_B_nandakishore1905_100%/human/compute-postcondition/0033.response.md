Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is equal to `t`.
- `m` is the second integer input split from the same input line.
- `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
- `k` is not a power of two and `k` is even.
- `l` is the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix.
- `p` is the length of `l`.
- `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\).
- `f` is zero.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(f)
```

Given that `f` is explicitly stated to be zero, the print statement will simply output the value of `f`.

Output: **0**
