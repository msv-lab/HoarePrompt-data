Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i`, `n`, and `m`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.
   - If `k` is a power of 2, then `k` remains unchanged.
   - If `k` is odd, then `k` remains unchanged.
   - If `k` is even and at least 14, then `k` is adjusted to be `k - 14`, `l` is the binary string representation of `k - 2`, `p` is the length of `l`, and `f` is `k - 14`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, `i` will be `i + 1` in the next iteration.
   - `n` and `m` remain unchanged because they are inputs and not modified within the loop.
   - `k` needs to be recalculated based on the new value of `i` (which is `i + 1`), but since the exact value of `k` is not given, we keep it as `k` in the next iteration.
   - `l`, `p`, and `f` are derived from `k`, so they will be recalculated in the next iteration based on the new value of `k`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `i + 1`.
- `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
- `k` is recalculated based on the new value of `i`, but its exact value is not specified, so we keep it as `k`.
- `l`, `p`, and `f` are recalculated based on the new value of `k`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, if `k` is a power of 2, then `k` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `k` is odd, `k` remains unchanged. If `k` is even and at least 14, then `k` is adjusted to be `k - 14`, `l` is the binary string representation of `k - 2`, `p` is the length of `l`, and `f` is `k - 14`.**
