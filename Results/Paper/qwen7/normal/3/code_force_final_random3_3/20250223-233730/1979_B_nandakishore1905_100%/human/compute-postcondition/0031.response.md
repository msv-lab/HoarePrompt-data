Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is equal to `t`; `m` is the second integer input split from the same input line; `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`; `k` is not a power of two and `k` is even; `l` is the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix; `p` is the length of `l`; `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\); `f` is zero.

Explanation: The loop continues to subtract \(2^{(p - 1)}\) from `f` until `f` becomes zero because `f` is initially an even number that is not a power of two. Each iteration reduces `f` by its highest power of two, which is equivalent to removing the leftmost '1' bit from its binary representation. After a series of such subtractions, all bits in `f` will eventually be removed, making `f` zero.
