Postcondition: `i` is 0, `string` is an input string from the user, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with the first character assigned to `x`, `n` is the length of the list `s` and equals 1, `done` is `False`. If the count of `x` in `s` is `n - 1`, then `n` is odd and the middle element of `s` is not equal to `x` or `n` is even and the middle element of `s` is equal to `x`. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables.
