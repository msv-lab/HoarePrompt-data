Output State: **`s` is a string, `j` is an index within the string such that `j + 1` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`, `done` is set to `True`, `count` is equal to `j`, `s[j + 1]` remains not equal to `x`, `count2` is 0, and we continue the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables or perform any operations. It simply moves the control flow to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement after the current block. Therefore, all the variables retain their previous values, and the loop continues as if the `continue` statement was not there.
