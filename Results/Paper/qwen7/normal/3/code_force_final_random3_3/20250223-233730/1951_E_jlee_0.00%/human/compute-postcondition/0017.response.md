Output: **string (where string is the input string provided by the user)**

Explanation:
- The initial state indicates that `string` is an input string provided by the user.
- No manipulation or modification of `string` is performed before the `print` statement.
- Therefore, when the `print(string)` statement is executed, it will print the original input string provided by the user.
