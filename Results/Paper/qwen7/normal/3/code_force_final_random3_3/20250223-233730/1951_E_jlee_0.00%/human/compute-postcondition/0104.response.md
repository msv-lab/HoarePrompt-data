Postcondition: `i` is 0, `string` is an input string from the user, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with the first character assigned to `x`, `n` is 1, `done` is `True`, `count` is either unchanged or less than 1, `count2` is either 0 or 1, and `j` is 0. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` remains unchanged. If the condition `count2 < count` is met, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` equals `count`, `done` is `True` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to `True` and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
