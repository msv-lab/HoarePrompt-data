- `i` is 0.
- `string` is an input string from the user.
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string, with the first character assigned to `x`.
- `n` is the length of the list `s` and equals 1.
- `done` is `False`.
- The count of `x` in `s` is equal to `n`.

Given these conditions, the print statement `print('NO')` will simply output the string 'NO'.
