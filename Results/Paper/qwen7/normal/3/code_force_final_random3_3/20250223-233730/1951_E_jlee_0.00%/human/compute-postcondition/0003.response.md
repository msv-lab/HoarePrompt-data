Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string from the user, `s` is a list of characters from the input string**.

The code `s = list(string)` converts the input string into a list of characters and assigns it to the variable `s`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged, and the original string is preserved.
