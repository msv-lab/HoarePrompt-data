The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not affect any variables or the overall state of the program. The variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string from the user, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the length of the list `s` and equals 1, `done` is `False`.**
