Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is a string.
- `j` is an index within the string such that `j + 1` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- `done` is set to `True`.
- `count` is either equal to `j` or greater than 0.
- `s[j]` remains not equal to `x`.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.

The print statement is simply `print('YES')`.

Given this information, the print statement will output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
