Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is a string.
   - `j` is an index within the string such that `j + 1` is less than `(n + 1) // 2`. This means `j < (n - 1) // 2`.
   - `done` is set to `True`.
   - `count` is equal to `j`.
   - `s[j + 1]` remains not equal to `x`.
   - If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
   ```

Given the conditions:
- Since `j` is an index within the string and `j < (n - 1) // 2`, `j - 1` would be a valid index for slicing the string.
- The slice `string[:j - 1]` will include all characters from the start of the string up to but not including the character at index `j - 1`.
- The slice `string[j - 1:]` will include all characters from the character at index `j - 1` to the end of the string.

Since no specific string `s` or value for `j` is provided, we can only describe the slices in terms of their indices.

Output: **string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:]**
