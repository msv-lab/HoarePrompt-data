You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

    #State: All input strings have been processed, `i` equals `t`, `string` is the last input string, `s` is a list of characters from the last input string, `n` is the length of `s`, `done` is `True` or `False` based on the conditions met, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `j` is the last value in the range `(n + 1) // 2` for the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes up to 10,000 test cases, where each test case consists of a string `s` of lowercase Latin characters. For each string, it checks if the string can be split into two parts such that the first part is the reverse of the second part, or if the string can be made into such a form by removing at most one character. If such a transformation is possible, it prints "YES" along with the number of operations (either 1 or 2) and the modified string; otherwise, it prints "NO". After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   
2. **Handling Single Character Strings:**
   - If the length of the string `n` is 1, it immediately prints 'NO' because a single character string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

3. **Checking for Non-Palindromic Substrings:**
   - The program checks if the first character `x` is different from the last character. If they are different, it prints 'YES' and the entire string as the partition, which is correct.
   
4. **Handling Strings with All Characters the Same:**
   - If all characters in the string are the same, it prints 'NO', which is correct because any partition will result in at least one palindromic substring.
   
5. **Handling Strings with Almost All Characters the Same:**
   - If all but one character are the same, it further checks if the length of the string is odd. If it is, and the middle character is different, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and the entire string as the partition.
   
6. **General Case:**
   - The program then enters a loop to check for the first non-matching pair of characters from both ends of the string.
     - If it finds such a pair, it prints 'YES' and the string as a single partition.
     - If it finds a character that is not equal to the first character `x`, it tries to split the string into two parts and checks if the remaining part can be a valid partition.
     - If no valid partition is found after checking all possible splits, it prints 'NO'.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Handling General Cases Incorrectly:**
   - The logic for handling general cases is flawed. The program attempts to find a non-matching pair and then tries to split the string, but it does not ensure that the resulting substrings are non-palindromic.
   - For example, consider the string "aab". The program might incorrectly conclude that "aab" can be split into "aa" and "b", but "aa" is a palindrome.

2. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the string can be split into more than two non-palindromic substrings correctly.
   - For example, the string "abcde" should be split into "abc" and "de", but the program might fail to recognize this.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
