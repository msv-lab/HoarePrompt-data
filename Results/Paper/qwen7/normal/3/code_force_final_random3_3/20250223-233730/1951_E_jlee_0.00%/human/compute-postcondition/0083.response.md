Output State: **`i` is 0, `string` is an input string from the user, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with the first character assigned to `x`, `n` is 1, `done` is `True`, `count` is less than 1, `count2` is 0, `j` is 0, and `count2` is 0. We continue the loop or iteration we were in.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of execution to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move directly to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables and the `continue` statement does not affect the values of existing variables, the values remain unchanged.
