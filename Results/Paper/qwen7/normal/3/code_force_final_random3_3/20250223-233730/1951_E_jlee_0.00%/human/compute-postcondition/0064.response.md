Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 0
- `string` is an input string from the user
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string with the first character assigned to `x`
- `n` is 1
- `done` is `True`
- `count` is less than 1
- `count2` is 0
- `j` is 0

The print statement is simply:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the other variables because the print statement does not reference any of those variables. It directly outputs the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
