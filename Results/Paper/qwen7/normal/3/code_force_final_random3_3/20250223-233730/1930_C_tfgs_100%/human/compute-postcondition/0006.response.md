Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current values**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is currently 2.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces.
   - `a[2]` is increased by 3.

3. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 3 (since it was 2 at the end of the previous iteration).
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than or equal to 2.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces, `a[2]` is increased by 3.**
