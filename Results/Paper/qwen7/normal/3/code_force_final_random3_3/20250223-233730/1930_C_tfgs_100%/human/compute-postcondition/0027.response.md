Output State: **`cnt` is reduced by `adv`, `ans` contains `n - 2` elements each calculated as `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1) - 1`, `a` remains unchanged, and `j` is `adv - 1`.**

Explanation:
- Initially, `ans` is a list containing `n - 2` elements, each calculated as `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1) - 1`.
- The loop runs for `adv` iterations, appending `a[i - 1] - j - 1` to `ans` in each iteration, where `j` starts from 1 and increases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `adv - 1`.
- After the loop, `j` is equal to `adv - 1`.
- The value of `cnt` is reduced by `adv`.
- The list `a` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
- Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `cnt`, the unchanged list `a`, the list `ans` with the specified elements, and the value of `j`.
