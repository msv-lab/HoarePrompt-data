Output State: `ans` is a list containing `n - 2` elements, each element being calculated as `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1) - 1`, where `adv` is the value it had after the last iteration of the loop. The variable `a` remains unchanged, and `j` is `adv - 1`.

To break this down further:
- Initially, `i` is set to 2, and since `a` is a list of integers sorted in descending order where each element `a[j]` is equal to `n - j`, we can deduce that `a[1] = n - 1` and `a[0] = n`.
- The loop runs for `adv` iterations, and in each iteration, it appends `a[i - 1] - j - 1` to `ans`. After 3 iterations, `j` is `adv - 1`.
- Since `a` is not modified within the loop, its values remain as they were initially.
- Therefore, `ans` will contain `n - 2` elements, each calculated as `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1) - 1`, reflecting the final value of `j` after the loop completes.
