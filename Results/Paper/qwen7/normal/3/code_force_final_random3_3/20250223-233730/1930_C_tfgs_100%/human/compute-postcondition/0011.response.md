Output State: **`cur` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[j]` (where \(0 \leq j < n\)) is increased by \(j + 1\) for every iteration \(j\) from 0 to \(n-1\), `counter` is a dictionary containing the count of each element in the list `a`.**

Explanation: The line `cur = 0` initializes the variable `cur` to 0. No other changes are made to the other variables or their values. Therefore, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `a`, and `counter` remain as they were in the initial state.
