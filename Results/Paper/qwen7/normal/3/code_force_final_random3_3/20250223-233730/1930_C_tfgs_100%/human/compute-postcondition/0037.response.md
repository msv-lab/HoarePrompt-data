Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `j` and `adv`.

2. **Determine the initial values**:
   - `j` is initially set to `adv - 1 - (a[i - 1] - j - 1)`.
   - `adv` is defined as `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is within the range of `0` to `adv - 1`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is set to `adv - 1 - (a[i - 1] - j - 1)`.
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so the new value of `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - `adv` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies it, but based on the given information, we assume it does not change.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - The new value of `j` will be `adv - 1 - (a[i - 1] - (j + 1) - 1)`, which simplifies to `adv - 1 - (a[i - 1] - j - 2)`.
   - Since `adv` does not change, it remains `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`j` is `adv - 1 - (a[i - 1] - (j + 1) - 1)`, `adv` is `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`**.
