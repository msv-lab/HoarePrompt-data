Output State: **`cur` is `cur + counter[a[i]]`, `cnt` is `cnt - adv`, `ans` contains `n - 1` elements each calculated as `a[adv - 1] - (adv - 1 - j)`, `a` remains unchanged, `j` is `adv - 1 - (a[i - 1] - (j + 2) - 1)`, `adv` is `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`, and `counter[a[i]]` is decreased by 1, and `i` is `i + 1` such that `i + 1 < len(a)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `adv` by calculating the minimum of three values: `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `cur`. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
