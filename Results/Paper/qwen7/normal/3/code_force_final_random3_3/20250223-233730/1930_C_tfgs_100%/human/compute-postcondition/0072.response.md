Output State: `cur` is 0, `cnt` must be equal to 3, `ans` now has `n` elements where the last element is `ans[0] - 2` and all other elements remain the same, `counter` is an empty dictionary.

Explanation: After the loop executes all 3 iterations, `cnt` will be equal to 3. Each iteration of the loop decrements the last element of `ans` by 1. Since the loop runs 3 times, the last element of `ans` will be decremented by 3 from its initial value, resulting in `ans[0] - 2`. All other elements in `ans` remain unchanged. The `counter` dictionary remains empty as it is not affected by the loop.
