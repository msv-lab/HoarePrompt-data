Output State: **`j` is `adv - 1 - (a[i - 1] - (j + 2) - 1)`, `adv` is `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`, `ans` contains an additional element `a[i - 1] - j - 1`**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `ans`. The new element is calculated as `a[i - 1] - j - 1`. Since `j` and `adv` are defined in terms of other variables, their values remain unchanged. The list `ans` now contains one more element, which is `a[i - 1] - j - 1`.
