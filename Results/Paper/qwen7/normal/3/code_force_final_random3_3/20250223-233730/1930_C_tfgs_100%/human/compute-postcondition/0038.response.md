Output State: **`j` is `adv - 1 - (a[i - 1] - (j + 1) - 1)`, `adv` is `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`, `ans` contains an additional element `a[i - 1] - j - 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a[i - 1] - j - 1` to the list `ans`. The values of `j` and `adv` remain unchanged from their initial states. The updated state of `ans` includes the new element.
