Output State: **`cur` is 0, `cnt` must be greater than 0, `ans` contains `n` elements each calculated as `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1 - j) - 1` for `j` in the range of `adv`, and `ans` now has its last element decremented by 1, `counter` is an empty dictionary.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)` appends the last element of `ans` minus 1 to the list `ans`. Since `ans` originally contained `n` elements, the new element appended is `ans[-1] - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
