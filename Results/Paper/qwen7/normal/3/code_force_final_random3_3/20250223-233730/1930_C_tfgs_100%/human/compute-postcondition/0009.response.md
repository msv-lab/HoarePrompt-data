Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces, each element `a[j]` (where \(0 \leq j < n\)) is increased by \(j + 1\) for every iteration \(j\) from 0 to \(n-1\).

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, each element `a[j]` in the list `a` will have been incremented by the sum of all integers from 1 to `j + 1`. In mathematical terms, the value of `a[j]` will be `a[j] + (j + 1)`, where `j` ranges from 0 to `n-1`.
