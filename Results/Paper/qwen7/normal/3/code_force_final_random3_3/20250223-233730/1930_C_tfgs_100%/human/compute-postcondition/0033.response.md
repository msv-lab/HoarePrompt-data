Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `len(a)`. The loop will continue as long as `i < len(a)`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cur` is reduced by `adv` and `cnt` is reduced by `adv - counter[a[i]]`.
   - `ans` contains `n - 1` elements each calculated as `a[i - 1] - (adv - 1)`.
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `j` is `adv - 1`.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` would be equal to the value it had at the start of the previous iteration plus 1.
   - Therefore, if `i` was `adv - 1` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `adv`.

4. **Ensure the loop condition is met**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(a)`. Given that `i` is now `adv`, the loop will continue if `adv < len(a)`.

5. **Adjust the other states**:
   - `cur` and `cnt` will be updated based on the new value of `i`.
   - `ans` will be updated based on the new value of `i`.
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `j` will be updated to `adv - 1` for the next iteration.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `cur` is reduced by `adv` and `cnt` is reduced by `adv - counter[a[adv]]`.
- `ans` contains `n - 1` elements each calculated as `a[adv - 1] - (adv - 1)`.
- `a` remains unchanged.
- `j` is `adv - 1`.

So, the final state is:

**`cur` is reduced by `adv` and `cnt` is reduced by `adv - counter[a[adv]]`, `ans` contains `n - 1` elements each calculated as `a[adv - 1] - (adv - 1)`, `a` remains unchanged, and `j` is `adv - 1`.**

State: **`cur` is reduced by `adv` and `cnt` is reduced by `adv - counter[a[adv]]`, `ans` contains `n - 1` elements each calculated as `a[adv - 1] - (adv - 1)`, `a` remains unchanged, and `j` is `adv - 1`**.
