Output State: **`adv` must be greater than 0, `cnt` and `cur` should be such that they allow `adv` to be greater than 0, `ans` now contains an additional element which is `a[i - 1] - j - 1`**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `ans`. The new element is calculated as `a[i - 1] - j - 1`. Since `adv`, `cnt`, and `cur` are not affected by this operation, their conditions remain the same. The only change is in the list `ans`, which now includes the new element.
