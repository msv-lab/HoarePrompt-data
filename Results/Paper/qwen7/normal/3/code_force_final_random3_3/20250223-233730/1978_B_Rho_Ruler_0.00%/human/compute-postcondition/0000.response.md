Output State: **t is a positive integer, ans is 0**

The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. Since the initial state of `t` is a positive integer and no other operations are performed on `t`, its value remains unchanged. The variable `ans` is explicitly set to 0, so the output state reflects this change.
