Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the maximum profit Bob can make by selling buns with a promotional price for the first \(k\) buns and a regular price for the rest. The goal is to maximize the profit, which is calculated as the sum of the prices of all buns sold.

2. **Binary Search Application**: The program uses binary search to find the optimal \(k\). This approach is appropriate because the profit function is monotonically decreasing with respect to \(k\), making binary search an efficient way to find the maximum profit.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function calculates the total profit for a given \(k\) using the formula \(k \times b + (n - k) \times a\).
   - It then checks if this profit is less than or equal to \(n \times \max(a, b)\).
   - The check \(ans \leq n \times \max(a, b)\) ensures that the profit does not exceed the maximum possible profit if all buns were sold at the higher price.

4. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search correctly updates the lower and upper bounds based on the result of `func_1`.
   - If `func_1(mid, a, b, n)` returns `True`, it means the current \(k\) might be too high, so the lower bound is updated to `mid + 1`.
   - If `func_1(mid, a, b, n)` returns `False`, it means the current \(k\) is too low, so the upper bound is updated to `mid - 1`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where \(k = 0\) correctly by setting the initial bounds appropriately.
   - The loop terminates when the optimal \(k\) is found, ensuring the maximum profit is calculated.

Given the analysis, the program logic is sound and correctly implements the binary search to find the optimal \(k\).

Correctness: **True**
