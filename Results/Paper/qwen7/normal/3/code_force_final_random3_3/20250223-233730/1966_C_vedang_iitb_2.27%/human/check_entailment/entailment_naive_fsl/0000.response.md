Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described. Specifically, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not seem to be related to determining the winner of the game. Instead, they appear to be performing operations on a list of integers, which does not align with the problem description.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to implement a function that determines the winner based on the XOR of the sizes of the piles. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def game_winner(n, a):
    xor_result = 0
    for pile in a:
        xor_result ^= pile
    if xor_result > 0:
        return "Alice"
    else:
        return "Bob"

# Reading input
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(game_winner(n, a))
```

This solution works as follows:
1. It iterates through the list of pile sizes and computes the XOR of all pile sizes.
2. If the result of the XOR operation is greater than 0, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.

This approach leverages the fact that the XOR of the pile sizes determines the winner when both players play optimally.
