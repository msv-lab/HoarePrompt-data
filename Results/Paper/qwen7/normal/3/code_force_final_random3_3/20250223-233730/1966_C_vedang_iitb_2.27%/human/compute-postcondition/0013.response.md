Output State: **The program returns 2**

Given the initial conditions:
- `winNext` is the return value of `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`.
- The condition `winNext == 2` is false.

Since `winNext == 2` is false, the code simply returns `2`. There is no other calculation or change to variables involved in this snippet.
