Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the winner of a game where players take turns removing a fixed number of stones from each non-empty pile, with the player who cannot make a move losing. The key insight is that the game state can be reduced to a Nim game, where the XOR of the pile sizes determines the winner.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function aims to transform the list `a` into a form that simplifies the game state analysis.
   - It sorts the unique values in `a` and then calculates the differences between consecutive elements.
   - However, the transformation is unnecessary for solving the problem correctly, as the original list `a` can be directly used in `func_2`.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the game state.
   - For `n == 1`, the player who starts always wins.
   - For `n == 2`, the player who starts wins if the first pile has an even number of stones, otherwise the second player wins.
   - For `n > 2`, it recursively checks the winning condition by considering the sub-game with one less pile (`a[1:]`).

4. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program correctly processes each test case by calling `func_2` with the transformed list `a` and the number of piles `n`.
   - It prints "Alice" if the function returns 1 (indicating the first player wins), otherwise it prints "Bob".

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_2` is sound and correctly implements the strategy to determine the winner based on the game state.
   - The main program correctly uses the output of `func_2` to decide the winner.
   - The transformation in `func_1` is redundant and does not affect the correctness of the solution.

Conclusion:
The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to determine the winner based on the game state, and the main program correctly interprets the results.

Correctness: **True**
