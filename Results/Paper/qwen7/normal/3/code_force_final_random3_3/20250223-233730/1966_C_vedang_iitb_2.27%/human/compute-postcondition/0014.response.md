Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: a list `a` of `n` integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile, and an integer `n` indicating the number of piles. Based on the values in the list `a`, the function returns either 1 or 2.**

This means the function `func_2` takes a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` as inputs. It then evaluates the list `a` and returns either 1 or 2 based on certain conditions that are not specified in the given information. There are five different cases where the function returns specific values, but without more details on the conditions, we can only state that the function returns 1 or 2 depending on the input list `a` and the integer `n`.
