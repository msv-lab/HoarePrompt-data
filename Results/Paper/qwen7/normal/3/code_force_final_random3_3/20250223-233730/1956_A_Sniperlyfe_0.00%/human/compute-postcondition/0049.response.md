Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` contains the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` appended to its previous contents.
- `n` is the fourth element of `qs`.
- `qs` still has at least two elements.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `map(str, res)` converts each element in `res` to a string.
2. `' '.join(...)` joins these string elements with a space separator.
3. Since `res` contains the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` appended to its previous contents, and `n` is the fourth element of `qs`, the exact content of `res` depends on the return value of `func_1(n, p)` and the previous contents of `res`.

Given the initial state, we know:
- `res` includes the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
- `n` is the fourth element of `qs`.

However, without the exact value of `func_1(n, p)` and the previous contents of `res`, we can only describe the output in terms of these components.

Therefore, the output will be a string where each element of `res` (including the result of `func_1(n, p)`) is converted to a string and joined by spaces.

Output: **'previous_contents_of_res func_1(n, p)' (where previous_contents_of_res is the content of res before appending func_1(n, p), and n is the fourth element of qs)**
