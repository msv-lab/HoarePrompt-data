Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Variables and their values:**
   - `t`: A positive integer (its specific value is not provided).
   - `k`: An input integer (its specific value is not provided).
   - `q`: An input integer (its specific value is not provided).
   - `p`: A list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `qs`: A list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, with the first two elements removed.
   - `n`: The third element in `qs`.
   - `res`: A list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended with the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

2. **The `func_1(n, p)` function:**
   - Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we can assume it returns a single integer value for the given inputs `n` and `p`.

3. **The `res` list:**
   - `res` contains the result of `func_1(n, p)` twice because it is appended with itself.

4. **The print statement:**
   - `print(' '.join(map(str, res)))` will join the elements of the `res` list into a single string with spaces between them and then print this string.

Given the above, the print statement will output the result of `func_1(n, p)` repeated twice, with a space between the two results.

Output: **func_1(n, p) func_1(n, p)**
