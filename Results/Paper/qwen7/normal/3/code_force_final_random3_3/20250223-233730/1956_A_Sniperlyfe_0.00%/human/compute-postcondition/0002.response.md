Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer**.

The code `k, q = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into integers. These integers are then assigned to `k` and `q`. The value of `t` remains unchanged and is still a positive integer.
