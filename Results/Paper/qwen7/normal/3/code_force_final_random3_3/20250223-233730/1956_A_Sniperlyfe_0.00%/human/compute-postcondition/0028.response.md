Based on the initial state provided:

- `qs` must have at least zero elements. This means `qs` could be an empty list or a list with one or more elements.
- `n` is the next element in `qs` if `qs` still has elements, otherwise `n` is undefined. Since `qs` must have at least zero elements, `n` will be the first element of `qs`.
- `res` is a list with the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` appended to it. Here, `func_1` is a function that takes two arguments, `n` and `p`. Since `n` is the first element of `qs` and `p` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value of `func_1(n, p)`. However, we know that this value is appended to `res`.

The `print` statement will join the elements of `res` into a single string with spaces between them and then print this string.

Given the information, the output will be a string representation of the list `res` with elements separated by spaces. Since we do not know the exact value of `func_1(n, p)`, we will represent it generically.

Output: **[func_1(n, p)]**
