Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `q` is an input integer.
- `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.
- `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`, where `n` is the first element in `qs`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)`, where `n` is the first element in `qs`.
2. `map(str, res)` converts each element in `res` to a string.
3. `' '.join(map(str, res))` joins these string elements with a space as the separator.

Since the exact content of `res` is not provided, we can only describe it in terms of the function `func_1(n, p)` and the value of `n`.

Therefore, the output will be a space-separated string of the results returned by `func_1(n, p)`, where `n` is the first element in `qs`.

Output: **a space-separated string of the results returned by func_1(n, p), where n is the first element in qs**
