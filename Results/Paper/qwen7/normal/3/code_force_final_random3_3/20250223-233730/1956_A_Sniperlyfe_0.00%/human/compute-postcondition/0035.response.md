Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is defined by the `for _ in range(t):` statement. The only variables involved here are `t` and the loop counter (which is `_` but is not used in the loop body).

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `qs` is a list of integers from the new input string.
   - `n` is the first element of `qs` (or undefined if `qs` is empty).
   - `res` is a list containing the results of applying `func_1(n, p)` to each element of `qs`.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop counter `_` is not used in the loop body, it does not affect the state directly.
   - The only variable that affects the loop condition is `t`. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.
   - After the loop has executed all its iterations, `qs` will still hold the list of integers from the new input string.
   - `n` will be the first element of `qs` (or undefined if `qs` is empty).
   - `res` will be a list where each element is the result of calling `func_1(n, p)` for every `n` in `qs`.

5. **State Adjustment**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `qs` remains the same.
   - `n` remains the first element of `qs` (or undefined if `qs` is empty).
   - `res` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `qs` is a list of integers from the new input string, `n` is the first element of `qs` (or undefined if `qs` is empty), `res` is a list containing the results of applying `func_1(n, p)` to each element of `qs`, and `t` must be greater than 0.**
