Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `qs = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes user input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `qs`. The values of `t`, `k`, and `q` remain unchanged.
