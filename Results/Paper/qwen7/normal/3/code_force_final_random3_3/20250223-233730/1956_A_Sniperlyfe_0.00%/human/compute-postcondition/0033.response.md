Output State: `qs` is a list of integers from the new input string, `n` is the first element of `qs` if `qs` is not empty, otherwise `n` is undefined, `res` is a list containing the result of applying `func_1(n, p)` to each element `n` in `qs`.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `qs` will retain its final state as a list of integers from the new input string, `n` will be set to the first element of `qs` if `qs` is not empty, or it will be undefined if `qs` is empty, and `res` will be a list containing the results of applying the function `func_1` to each element in `qs`.
