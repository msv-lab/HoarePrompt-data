Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `k` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the new input string and converted to integers, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers (with all elements remaining), now `qs` is updated to be the list of integers from the new input string.**

Explanation: The code `qs = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a new input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `qs`. The values of `t`, `k`, `q`, `p`, and the original `qs` remain unchanged, except that `qs` is now updated to reflect the new input.
