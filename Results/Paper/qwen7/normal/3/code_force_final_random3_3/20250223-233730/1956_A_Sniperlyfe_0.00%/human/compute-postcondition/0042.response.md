Output State: **`qs` must have at least two elements, `n` is the second element of `qs`, `res` now contains the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`, `k` and `q` are lists of integers from the input split, `p` is a list of integers from the new input split**.

Explanation: The code appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`. Here, `n` is the second element of `qs`, and `p` is a list of integers from the new input split. The function `func_1` is called with these two arguments, and its return value is added to `res`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
