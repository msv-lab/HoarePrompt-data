Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `n` and `qs`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `qs` has at least one element and there are elements left to iterate over in `qs`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `qs` is a list of integers from the new input string that must have at least one element.
   - `n` is the first element of `qs`.
   - `res` is a list with the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `n` is the first element of `qs` and the loop continues as long as `qs` has at least one element, after processing `n`, `qs` will have one less element.
   - Therefore, `qs` will now have at least zero elements (it could be empty if it had only one element initially).
   - `n` will be the next element in `qs` if `qs` still has elements, or it will be undefined if `qs` is empty.
   - `res` remains unchanged because the loop body does not modify `res`.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `qs` must have at least zero elements.
- `n` will be the next element in `qs` if `qs` still has elements, or it will be undefined if `qs` is empty.
- `res` remains the same.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`qs` must have at least zero elements, `n` will be the next element in `qs` if `qs` still has elements, otherwise `n` is undefined, `res` is a list with the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` appended to it**.
