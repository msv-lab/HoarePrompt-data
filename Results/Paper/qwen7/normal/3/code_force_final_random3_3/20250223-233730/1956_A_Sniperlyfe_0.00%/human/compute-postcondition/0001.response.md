Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable mentioned here is `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `t`**: The problem does not provide an explicit initial value for `t`. However, the loop will only execute if `t` is a positive integer.

3. **Determine the constraints on `t`**: Since `t` is used as an argument in `range(t)`, `t` must be a positive integer. Given the context of the problem, `t` should be a valid input that would allow the loop to execute.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Based on the above points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`, ensuring it is a positive integer.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`t` must be a positive integer**.
