Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State Description:**
   - `t` is a positive integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `q` is an input integer.
   - `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, but the first element is removed.
   - `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended with the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
   - `n` is the second element in `qs`.

2. **Code Snippet Analysis:**
   ```python
   print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
   ```
   - `res` is a list that contains the result of `func_1(n, p)` twice.
   - `map(str, res)` converts each element in `res` to a string.
   - `' '.join(map(str, res))` joins these string representations with a space as the separator.

3. **Determine the Value of `res`:**
   - Since `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` twice, let's denote the result of `func_1(n, p)` as `x`.
   - Therefore, `res = [x, x]`.

4. **Determine the Output:**
   - `' '.join(map(str, res))` will convert `x` to a string and join it with a space, resulting in `"x x"`.

Given the above steps, the output of the code snippet is:

Output: **x x (where x is the result of func_1(n, p))**
