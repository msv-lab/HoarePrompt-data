Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for n in qs:`. This means the variables involved in the loop head are `n` and `qs`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `res` contains the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`.
   - `n` is the third element of `qs`.
   - `qs` still has at least two elements.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be the fourth element of `qs` (since the third element has already been processed).
   - `qs` must still have at least two elements left after the fourth element is processed.

Given these conditions, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `n` is now the fourth element of `qs` and `qs` still has at least two elements remaining.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`res` contains the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`, `n` is the fourth element of `qs`, and `qs` still has at least two elements.**
