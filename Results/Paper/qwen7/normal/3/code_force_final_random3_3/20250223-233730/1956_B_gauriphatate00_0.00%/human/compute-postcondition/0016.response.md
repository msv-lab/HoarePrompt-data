Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `idx` is `idx + n`, `a` is a list of integers from `data[idx-n-1:idx-1]` converted using `map(int, ...)`, `results` is a list with two additional elements which are the return values of `func_1(n, a)` for the current and previous iterations.**

Explanation: The variable `idx` is incremented by `n`. The values of `data`, `a`, and `results` remain unchanged from their previous states. The list `a` continues to be derived from the slice of `data` starting from `idx-n-1` to `idx-1`, and `results` continues to store the return values of `func_1(n, a)` for the current and previous iterations.
