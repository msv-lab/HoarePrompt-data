Output State: **`data` is a list containing strings split from the input, `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, and the values of `n` and the list `a` will be determined later based on the input.**

The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input from the standard input (replaced with `sys.stdin.read`), splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `data`. The initial values of `t`, `n`, and the list `a` are not yet known and will be determined based on the input.
