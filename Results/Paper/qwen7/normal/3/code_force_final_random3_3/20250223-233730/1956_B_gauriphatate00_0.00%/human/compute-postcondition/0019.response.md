Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `idx` is `idx + n`, `a` is a list of integers from `data[idx-n-1:idx-1]` converted using `map(int, ...)`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(n, a)` for the next iteration, `n` is an integer from `data[idx]`.**

Explanation: The given code updates the value of `idx` by adding `n` to it (`idx = idx + n`). It also defines `a` as a list of integers extracted from the slice of `data` starting from `idx-n-1` to `idx-1` (inclusive of `idx-n-1` and exclusive of `idx-1`), and converts them using `map(int, ...)`. Additionally, `results` is updated to include the return value of `func_1(n, a)`. The initial state of `data` and the value of `n` from `data[idx]` are preserved.
