### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the maximum number of points you can get in the game.
   - Nene always plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.
   - You need to play optimally to maximize your score.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the number of pairs of identical cards in your hand using `Counter`.
   - It returns the minimum of the number of such pairs and half the number of your cards (`n // 2`).
   - This logic is based on the fact that Nene will always try to block your points by placing cards on the table when possible.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles reading multiple test cases and splitting the input data.
   - It processes each test case by calling `func_1` and prints the result.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is sound. It correctly identifies the number of pairs of identical cards and ensures that you do not score more points than the number of pairs divided by two.
   - The implementation in `func_2` is also correct. It reads the input properly, processes each test case, and prints the results.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the functions, the program correctly determines the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
