Output State: `data` remains unchanged, `idx` is `idx + 3 * n`, `a` is a list of integers from `data[idx-3*n:idx-2*n]` converted using `map(int, ...)`, `results` is a list with elements from each iteration of `func_1(n, a)` appended, totaling `t` elements.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `data` list remains unchanged. The `idx` variable will have been incremented by `3 * n` (since it increments by `n` each time through the loop and the loop runs `t` times). The `a` list will contain integers from the portion of `data` starting at `idx - 3 * n` up to but not including `idx - 2 * n`. Finally, the `results` list will contain the outputs of `func_1(n, a)` for each iteration of the loop, resulting in a total of `t` elements in `results`.
