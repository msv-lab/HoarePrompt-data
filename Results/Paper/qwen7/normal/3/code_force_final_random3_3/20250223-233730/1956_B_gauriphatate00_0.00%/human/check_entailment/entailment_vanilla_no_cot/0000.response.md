Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided solution correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the solution is correct:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the maximum number of points you can get.
   - It uses the `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each card value in your hand.
   - It then determines how many pairs of identical cards exist (`pairs`).
   - Finally, it returns the minimum of the number of pairs and half the number of turns (`n // 2`), which ensures that Nene's optimal strategy is accounted for.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input from stdin and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the list of card values in your hand (`a`).
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.
   - It then prints the results for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the functions, the solution correctly handles the input and computes the maximum number of points you can get under the assumption that Nene plays optimally. Therefore, the provided program is correct.
