Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, representing the number of cards you and Nene receive initially. The list `a` contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, representing the integers on the cards in your hand, and each integer from 1 through n appears in the list at most 2 times. The function `input` is replaced with `sys.stdin.read`.**

The code replaces the standard input reading method with `sys.stdin.read`, which reads the entire input data as a single string. However, it does not change the values of the variables `t`, `n`, or the list `a`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
