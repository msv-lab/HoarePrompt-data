Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `idx` is `idx + 1`, `a` is a list of integers from `data[idx-n-1:idx-1]` converted using `map(int, ...)`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(n, a)` for the next iteration, `n` is an integer from `data[idx]`**.

Explanation: The code `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `idx` is updated to `idx + 1`, while `data`, `a`, `results`, and `n` retain their previous states.
