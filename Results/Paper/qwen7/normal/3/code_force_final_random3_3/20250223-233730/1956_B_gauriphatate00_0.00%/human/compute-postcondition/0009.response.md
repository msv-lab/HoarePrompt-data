Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `idx` is `idx + 1`, `a` is a list of integers from `data[idx:idx + n]`**.

Explanation: The code creates a list `a` by mapping each element in the slice of `data` starting from `idx` and ending at `idx + n` (where `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`) to an integer. The original values of `data` and `idx` remain unchanged. The new list `a` contains the integer values of the elements in the specified slice of `data`.
