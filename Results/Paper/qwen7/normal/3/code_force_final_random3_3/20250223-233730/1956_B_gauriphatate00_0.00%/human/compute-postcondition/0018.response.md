Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(t)`. The only variables involved in the loop head are `t` (which is a constant or a variable defined outside the loop) and the loop counter `_`.

2. **Determine the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `data` is unchanged.
   - `idx` is `idx + n`.
   - `a` is a list of integers from `data[idx-n-1:idx-1]` converted using `map(int, ...)`.
   - `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(n, a)` for the current iteration.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop counter `_` is an underscore (`_`), it is not explicitly used in the loop body, but the loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.
   - The state of `data` remains unchanged.
   - `idx` is updated to `idx + n`.
   - `a` is recalculated based on the new value of `idx`.
   - `results` will have one additional element, which is the result of `func_1(n, a)` for the next iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated values of `idx` and the updated state of `a` and `results`.

**State:**
- `data` is unchanged.
- `idx` is `idx + n`.
- `a` is a list of integers from `data[idx-n-1:idx-1]` converted using `map(int, ...)`.
- `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(n, a)` for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`data` is unchanged, `idx` is `idx + n`, `a` is a list of integers from `data[idx-n-1:idx-1]` converted using `map(int, ...)`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(n, a)` for the next iteration.**
