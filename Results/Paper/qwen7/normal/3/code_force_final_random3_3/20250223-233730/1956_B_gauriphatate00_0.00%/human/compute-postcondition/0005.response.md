Output State: **`data` is a list containing strings split from the input, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `idx` is 2, and `results` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `results`. This operation does not affect the values of `data`, `t`, or `idx`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
