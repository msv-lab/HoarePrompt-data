Output State: **`data` is a list containing strings split from the input, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `idx` is 1, and the values of `n` and the list `a` will be determined later based on the input.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `data[idx]` (which is a string) to `t` after converting it to an integer using `int()`. Since `idx` was initially 0, after this assignment, `idx` is incremented to 1. The values of `n` and the list `a` remain unchanged as they were not affected by this line of code.
