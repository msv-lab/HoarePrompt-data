Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `idx` is `idx + n + 1`, `a` is a list of integers from `data[idx-n:idx]`**

Explanation: Initially, `idx` is incremented by 1 (`idx = idx + 1`). Then, `idx` is further incremented by `n` (`idx += n`). So, `idx` becomes `idx + n + 1`. The value of `a` is a list of integers from `data[idx:idx + n]`, which remains unchanged because the code does not modify `a`. The precondition that `data` is unchanged and `a` is a list of integers from `data[idx:idx + n]` still holds true.
