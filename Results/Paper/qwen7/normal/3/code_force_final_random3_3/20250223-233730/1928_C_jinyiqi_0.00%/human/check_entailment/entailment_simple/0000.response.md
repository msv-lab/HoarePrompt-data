### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the number of possible values of \( k \) such that Vasya's position \( n \) and the number he received \( x \) fit the given settling pattern.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The settling pattern can be described by the sequence of numbers from 1 to \( k \), then from \( k-1 \) to 2, and so on.
   - The position \( n \) and the number \( x \) must satisfy certain conditions based on the settling pattern.

3. **Analysis of the Code:**
   - The code correctly handles multiple test cases.
   - It checks if \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \) are even, which is necessary for the settling pattern to fit.
   - The function `func_1` calculates the divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \).

4. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is correct. It finds all divisors of \( x \) and returns them in a specific order.
   - The main loop checks if each divisor \( s \) satisfies the condition \( (s + 2) / 2 \geq x \), which ensures that the number \( x \) fits within the settling pattern.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases where \( n \) and \( x \) are within the specified bounds.
   - The use of sets to remove duplicates ensures that each valid \( k \) is counted only once.

6. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The code logic aligns with the problem statement and the provided examples.
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies the divisors, and the main loop correctly filters and counts the valid \( k \) values.

### Conclusion:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
