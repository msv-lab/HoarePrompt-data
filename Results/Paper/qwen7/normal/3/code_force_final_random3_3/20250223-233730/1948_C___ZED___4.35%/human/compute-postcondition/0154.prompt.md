Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `no_path` is `True`, `i` is `i_current + 1`, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `k` is `n-1`, `a` is a new string input by the user, `b` is the new input string.
Code of the loop:
for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):
    print(k)
    if a[k] != '>':
        no_path = False


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `no_path` is False, `i` is `i_current + 1`, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `k` is 1, `a` is a new string input by the user, `b` is the new input string, and the current value of `a[k]` is not '>'.

This means that after the execution of the if-else block, `no_path` becomes False, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains an integer greater than 4, `k` is set to 1, `a` and `b` retain their new string inputs, and specifically, `a[k]` is not the character '>'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `no_path` is False, `i` is `i_current + 1`, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `k` is 3, `a` is a new string input by the user, and `a[k]` is not '>', with no additional changes to other variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `no_path` is False, `i` is `i_current + 1`, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `k` is 5, `a` is a new string input by the user, and `a[k]` is not '>'.

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition `a[k] != '>'` is true or false, the variables retain their initial states as described, with `no_path` remaining False, `i` being `i_current + 1`, `n` still being an integer greater than 4, `k` staying at 5, `a` being a new string input by the user, and `a[k]` not being '>'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
