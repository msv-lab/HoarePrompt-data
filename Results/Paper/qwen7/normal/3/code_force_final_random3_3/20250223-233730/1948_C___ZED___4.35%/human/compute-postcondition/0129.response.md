Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head specifies the variable `k` in the range from `0` to `n` with a step of `2`. Therefore, the only variable that changes within the loop head is `k`.

2. **Determine the Current Value of `k`**: At the end of the previous iteration, it is given that `k` is `2`.

3. **Calculate the Next Value of `k`**: Since the loop increments `k` by `2` each time, the next value of `k` will be `2 + 2 = 4`.

4. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The condition for the loop to continue is that `k` must be less than `n`. Given that `n` must be greater than or equal to `2`, and `k` is now `4`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `4` for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the Other States**: The other states (`i`, `a`, `b`, and `no_path`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Based on these steps, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `i` is `i_current + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `k` is 4, `a` is a new string input by the user, `b` is the new input string, and if `b[k]` is not '>', `no_path` remains `False`.**
