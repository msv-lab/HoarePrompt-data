Output: **k (where k is the next even number after the current value of k and k > 1)**

Explanation:
- `no_path` is False, but this variable is not relevant to the print statement.
- `n` must be greater than 1, but its exact value is not needed for the print statement.
- The next even number after the current value of `k` is assigned to `k`. Since `k` is updated to the next even number, `k` will be an even number greater than 1.
- `a` is a string input by the user, but its content is not relevant to the print statement.
- The current value of `a[k]` is not '>', but this condition is also not relevant to the print statement.

Therefore, the print statement will output the updated value of `k`, which is the next even number after the original value of `k` and is greater than 1.
