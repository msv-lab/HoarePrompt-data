Postcondition: `no_path` is a boolean, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to the highest even number less than or equal to its initial value, `k` is either the highest even number less than or equal to the initial value of `n` or the last even number less than `n`, `a` is a string input by the user, and `b` is a string input by the user. If `no_path` is True, `k` is the highest even number less than or equal to the initial value of `n` and the character at the final position of `k` in `a` is not '>'. If `no_path` is False, `k` is the last even number less than `n` and the character at the final position of `k` in `a` is '>'.
