Output State: All iterations of the loop have been executed, meaning `i` is now equal to the total number of test cases provided as input. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` retain their values from the last iteration of the loop. Specifically, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and n is even, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', and `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'. After the loop, the value of `no_path` is determined based on the conditions checked within the loop, and it will be `True` or `False` accordingly. If `b[-2] != '>'`, the loop checks the conditions for `no_path` based on the values of `a` and `b` as described in the loop body.
