Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for k in range(0, n, 2)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `k` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `k` is less than `n` and `k` increments by 2 each time.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `i_current + 1`
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 2
   - `k` is 2
   - `a` is a new string input by the user
   - `b` is the new input string
   - `no_path` remains `False` if `b[k]` is not `'> '`.

4. **Determine the next value of `k`**: Since `k` starts at 2 and increments by 2 each time, the next value of `k` would be `2 + 2 = 4`.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than `n`. Given that `k` is now 4, `n` must be greater than 4.

6. **Adjust the states accordingly**: The only variables that need to be adjusted are `k` and `n`. The other variables (`i`, `a`, `b`, and `no_path`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is `i_current + 1`, `n` must be greater than 4, `k` is 4, `a` is a new string input by the user, `b` is the new input string, and if `b[k]` is not `'> '`, `no_path` remains `False`.**
