Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to check if the robot can reach the last column (2, n) when the arrows in the second row do not consistently point to the right. Here is an example to demonstrate this:

Consider the following input:
```
4
4
>>><
><>>
```

In this case, the robot starts at (1, 1) and needs to reach (2, 4). The path would be:
1. Move right to (1, 2).
2. Follow the arrow '<' to (1, 1).
3. Move right to (1, 2).
4. Follow the arrow '>' to (2, 2).
5. Move right to (2, 3).
6. Follow the arrow '<' to (2, 2).
7. Move right to (2, 3).
8. Follow the arrow '>' to (2, 4).

However, the program incorrectly prints 'NO' because it only checks if `b[-2]` is `'>` and if `n == 1`. It does not properly handle the scenario where the robot can navigate through the grid using a combination of moves and arrow directions.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
