Postcondition: **`a` is a string input from the user, `n` is an input integer, `b` is a new string input from the user, and the second last character of `b` is not '>'. If `n` equals 1, then `no_path` is True, `k` is set to `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `b[1]` is not '>', and the value of `a[k]` remains unchanged. If `n` does not equal 1, then `no_path` is True, `k` is set to `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `b[1]` is not '>', and the value of `a[k]` remains unchanged.**
