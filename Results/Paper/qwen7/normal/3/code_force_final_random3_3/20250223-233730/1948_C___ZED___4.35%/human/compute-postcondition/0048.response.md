Based on the initial state provided:

- `no_path` is `True`
- `k` is set to `n-1`
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `b[1]` is not `'>'`
- The value of `a[k]` remains unchanged as it was originally not `'>'`

The print statement simply outputs the string `'YES'`. Since no other variables or objects are involved in this print statement, the output is directly the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
