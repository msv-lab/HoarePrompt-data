Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is `i_current + 1`
- `n` is an integer greater than 4
- `k` is `n-1`, so `k` is also an integer greater than 3
- `a` is a new string input by the user
- `b` is the new input string
- `no_path` remains `False`
- If `no_path` is `False`, then `i` is incremented by 1 and `a[k]` is not `'>'.`

The `print('YES')` statement simply prints the string "YES" regardless of the values of other variables.

Output: **YES**
