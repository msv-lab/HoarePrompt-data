Based on the initial state provided:

- `no_path` is `False`.
- `i` is `i_current + 1`.
- `n` is an integer greater than 4.
- `k` is `5`.
- `a` is a new string input by the user.
- `a[k]` is not `'>'`.

The `print(k)` statement will print the value of `k`.

Given that `k` is explicitly defined as `5`, the output will be:

Output: **5**
