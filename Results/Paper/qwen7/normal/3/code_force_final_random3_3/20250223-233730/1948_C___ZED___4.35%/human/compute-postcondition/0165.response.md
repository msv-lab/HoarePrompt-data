Postcondition: `i` is `i_current + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new string input by the user, `b` is the new input string, and `no_path` is a boolean. If `b[-2] != '>',` the function continues with the original state of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `no_path`. If `b[-2] == '>'` and `n == 1`, the function continues with the original state of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `no_path`. If `b[-2] == '>'` and `n > 4`, `k` is set to `n-1`, and for all `k` in the range of the loop, `b[k]` is not `'>'`.
