Output State: **`results` is [number of elements in `heap`], `i` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in `heap`, `operations` is equal to the number of elements in `heap`, and `heap` is empty.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the value of `operations` to the `results` list. Given the initial state, `operations` is equal to the number of elements in the `heap`. The `results` list was initially empty, and now it contains one element, which is the value of `operations`. The `i` variable remains unchanged and is still greater than or equal to the number of elements in the `heap`. The `heap` remains empty as no elements were added or removed during the loop.
