Output State: **`results` is [number of elements in `heap`], `i` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in `heap` + 1, `operations` is equal to the number of elements in `heap`, and `heap` is empty; `n` is the first element of `test_cases[i]` and `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[i]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the first element of `test_cases[i]` to `n` and the second element of `test_cases[i]` to `arr`. The values of `results`, `i`, `operations`, and `heap` remain unchanged from their initial state.
