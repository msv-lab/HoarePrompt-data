Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `operations` is 0, `heap` contains its first element which is `smallest + 1`, and `smallest` is the smallest element from `heap[0]`**.

Explanation: The code `heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)` pushes the value `smallest + 1` into the heap. Since `smallest` is the smallest element from `heap[0]`, after the operation, the heap's first element changes to `smallest + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
