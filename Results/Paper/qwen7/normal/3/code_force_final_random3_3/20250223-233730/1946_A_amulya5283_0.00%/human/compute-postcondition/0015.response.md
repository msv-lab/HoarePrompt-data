Output State: **`smallest` is popped from `heap`, `results` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `operations` is 1, and `heap` contains `smallest + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)` pushes the value `smallest + 1` back into the heap. Since `smallest` was previously popped from the heap and is now used to calculate `smallest + 1`, the heap now contains `smallest + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
