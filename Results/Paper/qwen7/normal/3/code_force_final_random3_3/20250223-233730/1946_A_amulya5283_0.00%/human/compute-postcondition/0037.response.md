Output State: **`results` is [number of elements in heap - 1], `i` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in heap + 3, `operations` is 3, `heap` is now a min-heap containing `arr[median_index + 1:]` with the smallest element being `current_median`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `smallest + 1`, `smallest` is the second smallest element from the original heap after removing the smallest element.**

Explanation: The line `smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)` pops the smallest element from the heap and assigns it to `smallest`. Since `heap` was a min-heap with the smallest element being `smallest + 1`, after popping the smallest element, the new smallest element in the heap will be `current_median`, which is `smallest + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
