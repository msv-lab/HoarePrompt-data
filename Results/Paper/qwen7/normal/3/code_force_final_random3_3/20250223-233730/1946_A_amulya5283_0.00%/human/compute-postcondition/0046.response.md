Output State: **`results` is [5], `i` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in heap + 6, `operations` is 5, `heap` is now a min-heap containing `arr[median_index + 1:]` with the smallest element being `current_median + 1 + 5`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `smallest + 1`, `smallest` is the second smallest element from the original heap after removing the smallest element twice.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `operations` (which is 5) to the `results` list. This does not change the values of `i`, `heap`, `median_index`, `current_median`, or `smallest`. The smallest element in the heap has been incremented by 5, making it `current_median + 1 + 5`. The output state includes all the variables that were previously defined and updated them according to the changes made by the code.
