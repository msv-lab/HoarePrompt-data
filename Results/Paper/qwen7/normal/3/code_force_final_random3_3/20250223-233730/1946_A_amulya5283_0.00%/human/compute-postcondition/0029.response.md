Output State: **`results` is [number of elements in `heap`], `i` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in `heap` + 1, `operations` is equal to the number of elements in `heap`, and `heap` is now equal to `arr[median_index:]`; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`**

Explanation: The line `heap = arr[median_index:]` assigns a slice of the array `arr` starting from the index `median_index` to the variable `heap`. Since `median_index` is `n // 2`, `heap` now contains all elements of `arr` from index `n // 2` to the end. All other variables (`results`, `i`, `operations`, `median_index`, and `current_median`) remain unchanged as per the initial state.
