Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `n` is the first element of the tuple in `test_cases` at index `i`, `arr` is the second element of the tuple in `test_cases` at index `i`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the first element of the tuple in `test_cases` at index `i` to `n` and the second element of the tuple to `arr`. The values of `results` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
