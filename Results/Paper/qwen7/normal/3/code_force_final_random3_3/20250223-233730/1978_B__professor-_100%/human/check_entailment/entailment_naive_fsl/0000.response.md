Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program does not consider the scenario where `b` is between `a` and `n`. Let's analyze the logic:

1. If `b <= a`, the program correctly prints `n * a`.
2. If `b - a >= n`, the program correctly calculates the sum of an arithmetic series using the formula `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`.
3. However, if `a < b < a + n`, the program does not handle this case correctly. It uses the formula `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n`, which is incorrect because it does not account for the proper distribution of the modified prices.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input: `n = 5`, `a = 5`, `b = 7`
- Expected output: The optimal choice is to sell the first two buns at 7 and 6 coins respectively, and the remaining three buns at 5 coins each. The total profit would be `7 + 6 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 28`.

However, the program outputs:
```
(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n = (7 - 5) * (7 - 5 + 1) // 2 + 5 * 5 = 2 * 3 // 2 + 25 = 3 + 25 = 28
```

This calculation is incorrect because it does not properly distribute the modified prices. The correct approach would be to calculate the sum of the modified prices directly.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases and thus the correctness is **False**.
