Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is set to `t-1`, but this does not affect the print statement directly since `t` is not used in it.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is an input integer.

The print statement `print(n * a)` will multiply the value of `n` by the value of `a` and print the result.

Output: **n * a (where n is an input integer and a is an input integer)**
