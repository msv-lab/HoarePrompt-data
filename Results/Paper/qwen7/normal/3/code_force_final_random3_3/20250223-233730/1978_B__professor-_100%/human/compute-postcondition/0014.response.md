Output State: **`t` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively. The value of `t` is reduced by 1 due to the precondition, but the exact value of `t` is not specified, so we only know that `t` is now `t-1`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are set to the integers input by the user, and their previous values as inputs are no longer relevant.
