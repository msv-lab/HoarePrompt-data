Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer.**

After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will be decremented until it reaches 0, as it represents the number of test cases. At this point, there will be no more inputs to process, and the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` will be the last set of values read from the input during the loop's final iteration. All other variables outside the loop will retain their values from the initial state or remain unchanged.
