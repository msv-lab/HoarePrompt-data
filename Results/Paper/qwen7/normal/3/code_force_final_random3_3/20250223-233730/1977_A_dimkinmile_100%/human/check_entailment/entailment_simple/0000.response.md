Reasoning:

1. The program should read the number of test cases `t` from the input.
2. For each test case, it should read two integers `n` and `m`.
3. It should check if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
4. The logic to determine if it's possible is correct: `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0`. This ensures that the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative, which means the operations (adding or removing cubes) can balance out to result in `m` cubes.

However, there are a few issues with the provided program:

- The variable `kreker` is used instead of the expected variable `t` in the loop.
- The function `func_1()` is called without passing any arguments, but it expects `n` and `m` to be provided.
- The program does not handle the input correctly for multiple test cases.

Given these points, let's correct the program:

```python
t = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases
for _ in range(t):  # Loop over each test case
    n, m = map(int, input().split())  # Read n and m for each test case
    if ((n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

With this corrected version, the program should work as expected.

Correctness: **False**

The original program does not correctly implement the logic for handling multiple test cases and does not pass the necessary parameters to the function.
