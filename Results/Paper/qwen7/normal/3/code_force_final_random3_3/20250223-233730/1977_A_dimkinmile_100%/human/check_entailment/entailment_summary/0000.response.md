Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by defining a function `func_1()` that processes the input values \( n \) and \( m \) and checks if the difference \( n - m \) is even and non-negative. Based on this check, it prints 'Yes' or 'No'.

However, there is an issue with the loop in the main part of the program. The loop variable `i` is not used within the loop, and the function `func_1()` is called without passing any arguments. This means that the function `func_1()` is not actually being called with the correct inputs for each test case.

To fix this, the function should be called inside the loop with the appropriate arguments. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    func_1(n, m)
    
def func_1(n, m):
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

With this correction, the function `func_1()` will be called with the correct inputs for each test case, and the program will work as intended.

Correctness: **False**
