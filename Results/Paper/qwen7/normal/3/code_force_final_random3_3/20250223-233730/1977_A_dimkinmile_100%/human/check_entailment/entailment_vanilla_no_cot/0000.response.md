Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining whether it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Specifically:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program calls `func_1()` without passing any arguments, which means `func_1()` will receive default values for `n` and `m`. This is incorrect because `func_1()` expects two arguments (`n` and `m`).

2. **Logic Error**: The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` is flawed. It checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative. However, this does not correctly determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Instead, you should check if the absolute difference between `n` and `2 * m` is even, because each move can either add or remove one cube.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if abs(n - 2 * m) % 2 == 0 and abs(n - 2 * m) <= n:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This version correctly handles the input and uses the appropriate logic to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
