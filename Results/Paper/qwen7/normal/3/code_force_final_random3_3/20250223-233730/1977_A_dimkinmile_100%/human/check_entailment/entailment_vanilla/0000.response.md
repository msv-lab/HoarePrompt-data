### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `kreker` using `input()` and converts it to an integer.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a for loop.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - A function `func_1()` is defined but not used in the main loop. This is unnecessary and should be removed or properly utilized.

3. **Test Case Processing**:
   - Inside `func_1()`, the program reads two integers `n` and `m` for each test case.
   - It checks if `(n - m)` is even and non-negative. If this condition is met, it prints 'Yes', indicating that it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

4. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` ensures that the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative.
   - This condition is correct because:
     - Each move either adds 1 cube (increasing the count by 1) or removes 1 cube (decreasing the count by 1).
     - To end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves, the net change in the number of cubes must be `m - initial_count`.
     - Since the initial count is 0, the net change must be `m`.
     - The net change `m` must be achievable by an even number of moves (since adding and removing cubes alternately results in an even net change).

5. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program outputs 'Yes' or 'No' correctly based on the condition.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves. The function `func_1()` is correctly defined and used within the loop to process each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**
