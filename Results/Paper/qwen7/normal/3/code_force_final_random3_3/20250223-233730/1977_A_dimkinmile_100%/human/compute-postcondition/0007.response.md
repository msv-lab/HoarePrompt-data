Functionality: **The function processes two integers, \( n \) and \( m \), and checks if their difference (\( n - m \)) is even and non-negative. If the condition is met, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value but modifies the output based on the given conditions.**
