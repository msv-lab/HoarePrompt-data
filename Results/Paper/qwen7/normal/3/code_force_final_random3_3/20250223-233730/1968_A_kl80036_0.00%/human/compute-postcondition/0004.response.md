Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `x` is an input integer between 1 and 1000
   - `y` is `x // 2`

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop is defined as `for i in range(int(input())):`

3. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will run for each value in the range from 0 to `int(input()) - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.

4. **Determining the Next Value of `i`:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration.

5. **Adjusting Other Variables:**
   - The variables `x` and `y` are not part of the loop head and their values remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body, which is omitted here.
   - Hence, `x` and `y` retain their initial values.

6. **Final State for the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `x` is an input integer between 1 and 1000 (unchanged)
   - `y` is `x // 2` (unchanged)

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `y` is `x // 2`**
