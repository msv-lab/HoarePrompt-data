Output State: **`i` is 2, `x` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `y` is `x // 2`, and the value obtained from `int(input())` is greater than 1**

Explanation: The code `y = x // 2` does not change the values of `i` or `x`. It only updates the value of `y` to be the integer division of `x` by 2. The condition that the value obtained from `int(input())` is greater than 1 remains unchanged.
