### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \leq y < x \)) such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized.
2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \( x \).
   - It calculates \( y \) as \( y = \frac{x}{2} \) and prints this value.
3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic of setting \( y = \frac{x}{2} \) does not necessarily maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\). 
   - For example, consider \( x = 10 \):
     - If \( y = 5 \), \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7\).
     - However, if \( y = 9 \), \(\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10\), which is greater than 7.
   - Therefore, \( y = \frac{x}{2} \) is not always the optimal choice.
4. **Counterexample**:
   - For \( x = 10 \), the program outputs \( y = 5 \), but a better choice would be \( y = 9 \).

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem because it does not guarantee finding the maximum possible value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

### Response:
Correctness: **False**
