Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `y` is `x // 2`**

The code `y = x // 2` does not change the values of `i` or `x`. It updates the value of `y` to be the integer division of `x` by 2. Since `x` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `y` will be the integer division of `x` by 2, which remains within the range of 0 to 499 (inclusive).
