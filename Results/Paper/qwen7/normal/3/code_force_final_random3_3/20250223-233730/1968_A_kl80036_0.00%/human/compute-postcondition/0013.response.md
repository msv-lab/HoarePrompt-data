Output State: The loop will continue to execute as long as the user provides more inputs. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to the total number of times the loop has executed, which is the value entered on the first line minus one. For each iteration, `x` will be an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), and `y` will be `x // 2`. The final value of `i` will be the total number of inputs provided, and `y` will be the result of dividing the last provided `x` by 2.
