Postcondition: `i` is 0, `len_a` is a non-negative integer, `len_b` is a non-negative integer, and max(`len_a`, `len_b`) is a positive integer. The length of `len_a` is greater than `i + 1`, the length of `len_b` is greater than `i + 1`, and if `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, then `count_b` is 1. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `len_a`, `len_b`, and `count_b` remain unchanged.
