Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. The initial condition that `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are set to the integers entered by the user.
