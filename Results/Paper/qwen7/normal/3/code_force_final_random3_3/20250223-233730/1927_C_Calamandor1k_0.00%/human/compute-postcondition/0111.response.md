Postcondition: `i` is 0, `len_a` is the length of list `a`, `len_b` is the length of list `b`, and `i` is less than `max(len_a, len_b)`. The current value of `len_a` is greater than `i + 1`, and if `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, then `count_a` is 1. If `a[i]` is greater than `k`, then `count_a` remains unchanged.
