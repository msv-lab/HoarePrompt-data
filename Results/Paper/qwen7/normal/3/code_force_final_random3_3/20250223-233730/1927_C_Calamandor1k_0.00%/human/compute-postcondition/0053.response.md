Output State: **`t` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from another input string split on spaces and converted to integers, `len_a` is the length of list `a`, `len_b` is the length of list `b`, `count_a` is 0, `count_b` is 0, `d` is `k // 2`.**

The value of `d` is assigned the integer division of `k` by 2. Since `k` is an input integer, `d` will be the integer result of dividing `k` by 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
