The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop variable and does not hold any specific value. The loop itself is controlled by the variable `t`, which determines how many times the loop should run.

Given that the loop is controlled by `t`, and assuming `t` is a positive integer representing the number of iterations, the loop will execute one more time if `t` is greater than 0. Since the problem does not provide the exact value of `t` but only the condition that it controls the loop, we need to ensure that `t` is decremented by 1 for each iteration to allow the loop to continue.

Since no other variables are mentioned in the loop head, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
