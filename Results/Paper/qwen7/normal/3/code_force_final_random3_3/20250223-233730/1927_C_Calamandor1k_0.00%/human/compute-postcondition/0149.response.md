Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes positive integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^5), an even integer k (2 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅min(n, m)), and two arrays a and b (each containing n and m integers respectively, with values in the range 1 to 10^6). The function returns different outputs based on the conditions specified for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters and arrays. It processes these inputs according to certain conditions and returns results accordingly.
