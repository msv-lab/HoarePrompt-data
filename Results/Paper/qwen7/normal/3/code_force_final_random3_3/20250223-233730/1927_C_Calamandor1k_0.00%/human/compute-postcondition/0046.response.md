Based on the initial state provided, we know that:

- `i` has reached the value of `max(len_a, len_b)`.
- `count_a` is the total number of elements in list `a` that are less than or equal to `k`.
- `count_b` is the total number of elements in list `b` that are less than or equal to `k`.

The `print` statement checks if both `count_a` and `count_b` are greater than or equal to `d`. If both conditions are met, it prints `'YES'`; otherwise, it prints `'NO'`.

To determine what will be printed, we need to consider the values of `count_a` and `count_b` relative to `d`.

Since the exact values of `count_a`, `count_b`, and `d` are not provided, we can only describe the condition under which the output will be `'YES'` or `'NO'`.

Output: **'YES' if count_a >= d and count_b >= d, else 'NO'**
