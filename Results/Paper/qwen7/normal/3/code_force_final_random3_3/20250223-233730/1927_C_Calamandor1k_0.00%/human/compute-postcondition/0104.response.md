Output State: **`count_a` is 0, `count_b` is 0, `len_a` is the length of list `a`, `len_b` is the length of list `b`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `d` is `k // 2`**.

The value of `d` is calculated as `k // 2`, which means `d` is the integer division of `k` by 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
