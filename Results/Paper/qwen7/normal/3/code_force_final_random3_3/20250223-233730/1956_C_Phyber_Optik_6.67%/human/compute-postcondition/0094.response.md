Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined as `for j in range(1, n + r + 1)`. The variables involved in this loop are `j` and the range boundaries, which are `1`, `n + r + 1`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is given as `j` is 2, `n` is at least 1, and `j` is less than or equal to `n + r`.

3. **Check if the loop can continue**: For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `n + r + 1`. Given that `j` is currently 2 and `j` is less than or equal to `n + r`, the loop can continue if `n + r` is at least 2.

4. **Update the state**: Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 3. Therefore, `j` must be 3 for the loop to continue. Also, since `j` must still be less than or equal to `n + r`, `n + r` must be at least 3.

5. **Adjust the state**: The state needs to reflect that `j` is now 3 and `n` is at least 1 (since `n` is at least 1 and `r` is non-negative, `n + r` being at least 3 implies `n` is at least 2).

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`j` is 3, `n` is at least 2**
