Output State: **`j` is 2 * n + 2, `n` must still be at least 1, `r` is `i`, `t` remains t - n * n, and `sum` is updated to sum + 3 * n**.

Explanation: The code snippet `r = i` assigns the value of `i` to `r`. No other variables are affected. The initial conditions for `j`, `n`, `t`, and `sum` remain unchanged except that `r` now holds the value of `i`.
