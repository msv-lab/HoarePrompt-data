Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `sum` is 0, `r` is 1, and the current value of `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than the current value of `i * n`.**

Explanation: The variable `r` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
