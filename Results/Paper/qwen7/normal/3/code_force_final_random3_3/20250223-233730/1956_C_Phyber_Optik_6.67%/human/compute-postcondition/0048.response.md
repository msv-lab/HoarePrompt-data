Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is `j + 1`
- `n` is known
- `r` is known
- `sum` remains 0 if `j + 1` is still less than or equal to `n + r`

The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive. The values of `n` and `r` do not affect the range being printed since the `range` function only depends on `n` in this context.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n**
