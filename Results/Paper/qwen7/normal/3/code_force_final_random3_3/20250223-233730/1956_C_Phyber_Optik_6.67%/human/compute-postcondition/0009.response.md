Output State: **`sum` is `i * n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `r` is 0, and the condition `(n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n)` holds true.**

Explanation: The code `sum += i * n` updates the value of `sum` by adding `i * n` to its current value. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, so `i * n` is `n`. After the addition, `sum` becomes `n`. Also, since the condition `(n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n)` holds true initially, and `i` is incremented to 2 (as part of the loop or sequence of operations implied by the condition), the updated condition would be checked again with `i` as 2. However, the specific value of `n` remains unchanged, and the other variables (`i` is now 2, `r` is still 0) are updated accordingly.
