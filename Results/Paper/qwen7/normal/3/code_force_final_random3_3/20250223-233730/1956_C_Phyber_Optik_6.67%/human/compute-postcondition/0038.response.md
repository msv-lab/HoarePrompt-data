Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is `j + 1`, which means `j` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `n` is known (though its specific value is not provided).
- `r` is known (though its specific value is not provided).
- `sum` is 0 if `j` is still less than or equal to `n`.

The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

Since `j` is `j + 1`, it implies that `j` was previously less than or equal to `n`, and now it has been incremented by 1. Therefore, the condition `j <= n` is no longer true, but this does not affect the range being printed because the `print` statement is independent of the value of `j` in this context.

Thus, the output will be the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.

Output: **1 2 ... n**
