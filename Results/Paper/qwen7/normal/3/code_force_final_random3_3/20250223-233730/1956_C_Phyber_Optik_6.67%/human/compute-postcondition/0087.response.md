Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j`, `n`, and `r`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n + r`. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n + r`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 1
   - `n` is at least 1
   - `t` is some initial value (not relevant to the loop)
   - `i` is some initial value (not relevant to the loop)
   - `r` is some initial value (not relevant to the loop)
   - Either `j` is less than or equal to `n` or `j` is greater than `n`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts at 1 and the loop increments `j` by 1 each iteration, if `j` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than or equal to `n + r`. Given that `j` is now 2, `n` is at least 1, and `r` is some initial value, `n + r` must be at least 2 for the loop to continue.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` will be 2.
   - `n` remains at least 1.
   - `r` remains some initial value.
   - The condition `j` is less than or equal to `n + r` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `j` is 2, `n` is at least 1, `r` is some initial value, and `j` is less than or equal to `n + r`.**
