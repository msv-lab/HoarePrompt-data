Output State: **`sum` is either 2 * n + n * (n + 1) // 2 or 2 * n + 2 * n, depending on whether the condition n * (n + 1) // 2 > 2 * n holds true; `i` is 2; `r` is 2.**

Explanation: The code `sum += n * (n + 1) // 2` adds `n * (n + 1) // 2` to the current value of `sum`. Depending on the initial state of `sum`, if `sum` was initially `0 + n * (n + 1) // 2`, then it becomes `2 * n + n * (n + 1) // 2`. If `sum` was initially `2 * n`, then it becomes `2 * n + 2 * n`. The values of `i` and `r` remain unchanged.
