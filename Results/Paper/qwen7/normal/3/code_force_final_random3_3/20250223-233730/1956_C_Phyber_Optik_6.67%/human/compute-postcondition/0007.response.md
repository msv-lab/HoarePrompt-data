Output State: **`sum` is now 0 + n * (n + 1) // 2, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `r` is 1.**

The code updates the variable `sum` by adding the value of `n * (n + 1) // 2` to its current value. Since `sum` was initially 0, it now becomes `n * (n + 1) // 2`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial states.
