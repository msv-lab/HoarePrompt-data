Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is `2 * n + 2`
- `n` must be at least 1
- `r` must be at least `n + 1`
- The current value of `j` is less than or equal to `n`

From these conditions, we can deduce the following:

1. Since `j` is `2 * n + 2` and `j` is also less than or equal to `n`, this implies that `n` must be very small. The only value that satisfies both conditions is `n = 1` because if `n` were 2 or greater, `j` would be greater than `n`.

2. If `n = 1`, then `j = 2 * 1 + 2 = 4`, which is consistent with the condition that `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

Given `n = 1`, the `range(1, n + 1)` will generate a range from 1 to `n + 1`, which is 1 to 2.

Therefore, the output of `print(*range(1, n + 1))` will be the numbers 1 and 2 printed as separate elements.

Output: **1 2**
