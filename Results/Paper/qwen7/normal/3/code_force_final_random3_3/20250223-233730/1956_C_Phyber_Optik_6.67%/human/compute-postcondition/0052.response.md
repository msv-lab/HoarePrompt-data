Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `range(t)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `_` (a dummy variable used for iteration), `t` (the number of iterations), and the loop body operations.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - The loop variable `j` is not directly controlled by the loop itself but by the loop body. However, since no specific operations on `j` are mentioned, we assume `j` starts from `1` and increments by `1` per iteration.
   - `n` and `r` remain unchanged as per the problem statement.
   - `sum` remains `0` as there are no operations that modify `sum` within the loop body.

3. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is `n + r + 1` (after completing all iterations).
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `r` remains unchanged.
   - `sum` remains `0`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than the current value of the loop counter.
   - Since `j` starts from `1` and increments by `1` per iteration, the next value of `j` would be `n + r + 2` if the loop were to execute one more time.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - `j` should be set to `n + r + 2`.
   - `t` should be decremented by `1` to reflect that one more iteration is needed.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `r` remains unchanged.
   - `sum` remains `0`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`j` is `n + r + 2`, `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is initial `n`, `r` is initial `r`, `sum` is `0`**.
