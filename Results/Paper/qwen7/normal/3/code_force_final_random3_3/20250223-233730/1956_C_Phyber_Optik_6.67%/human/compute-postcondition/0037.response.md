Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is `j + 1`, which means `j` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `n` is known, but its specific value is not provided.
- `r` is known, but its specific value is not provided.
- `sum` is 0 if `j` is still less than or equal to `n`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(1, j, end=' ')
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `print` function will print the values of its arguments separated by a space.
2. The first argument is `1`, which is a constant value.
3. The second argument is `j`, which has been incremented by 1 from its previous value.
4. Since the exact value of `j` is not provided, we know it is now one more than its previous value. However, without knowing the initial value of `j`, we cannot specify the exact number it represents.

Therefore, the output will be a 1 followed by the new value of `j`, with no newline character added because of the `end=' '` parameter.

Output: **1 [new_value_of_j]**
