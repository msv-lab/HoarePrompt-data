Output State: **`j` is `2 * n + 2`, `n` is at least 1, `r` is either `i` or 3 depending on the previous values of `i`, `t` is reduced by `n * n` for each iteration, and `sum` is `3 * n * n + n * (n + 1) // 2` since it is incremented by `3 * n + n * (n + 1) // 2` for each iteration.**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `j` will remain as `2 * n + 2`, `n` will still be at least 1, `r` could be `i` or 3, `t` will be reduced by `n * n` for each iteration, and `sum` will be the total of `3 * n * n` plus `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all iterations.
