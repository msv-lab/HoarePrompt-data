Given the initial state where `j` is 3 and `n` is at least 2, the `range(1, n + 1)` function will generate a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive). Since `n` is at least 2 but its exact value is not specified, the smallest possible value for `n` is 2. However, since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can only describe the output based on the minimum value of `n`.

Let's consider the minimum value of `n`, which is 2:
- When `n = 2`, the range will be `range(1, 2 + 1)`, which generates the sequence `[1, 2]`.

The `*` operator before `range(1, n + 1)` will unpack the sequence into individual arguments for the `print` function, resulting in the numbers being printed separately.

Output: **1 2**
