Given the initial state:
- `j` is 1
- `n` is known but its specific value is not provided
- `r` is known but its specific value is not provided
- `sum` is 0
- `j` is greater than `n`

Let's break down the print statement:

```python
print(2, j % n, end=' ')
```

1. **First Argument: `2`**
   - This is a constant integer value, so it will be printed as is.

2. **Second Argument: `j % n`**
   - Here, `j` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1 (since `j` is greater than `n` is stated as false, meaning `j` cannot be greater than `n` if `j` is 1).
   - Therefore, `1 % n` will always result in 1 because any number modulo itself (or a larger number) where the smaller number is 1 will always be 1.

3. **`end=' '`**
   - This specifies that there should be a space after the printed values instead of a newline.

Combining these observations, the print statement will output `2` followed by `1` with a space in between.

Output: **2 1**
