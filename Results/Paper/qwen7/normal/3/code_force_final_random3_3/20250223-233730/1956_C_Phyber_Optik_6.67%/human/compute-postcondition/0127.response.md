Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is set to `2 * n + 2`, where `n` must be at least 1.
- `r` is either `i` or 3 depending on the previous values of `i`.
- `t` is reduced by `n * n` for each iteration.
- `sum` is updated to `sum + 3 * n + n * (n + 1) // 2` for each iteration, and this update happens for all iterations since `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n`.

Given these conditions, let's break down the values:

1. **Sum Calculation**: 
   - For each iteration, `sum` is updated to `sum + 3 * n + n * (n + 1) // 2`.
   - Since `i` ranges from 1 to `n`, and the update happens for each iteration, the final value of `sum` will be the sum of `3 * n` for each iteration plus `n * (n + 1) // 2` for each iteration.
   - This simplifies to `sum = 3 * n * n + n * (n + 1) // 2`.

2. **Value of `n`**:
   - `n` is at least 1, but its exact value is not specified. Let's denote it as `n`.

3. **Value of `r`**:
   - `r` can be either `i` or 3. Since `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n`, `r` could be any value between 1 and 3 depending on the specific values of `i` during the iterations.

4. **Value of `j`**:
   - `j` is set to `2 * n + 2`, so its value is determined by the value of `n`.

Therefore, the print statement `print(sum, n + r)` will output the final value of `sum` and the expression `n + r`.

Output: **3 * n * n + n * (n + 1) // 2, n + r**
