Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the sum of the matrix using at most 2n operations.
2. The provided code attempts to calculate the sum and the number of operations needed, but it does not correctly implement the logic required to achieve the maximum sum.
3. The code calculates `sum` as `3 * n * n + n * (n + 1) // 2` and sets `r` to 3, which is incorrect for general values of `n`.
4. The operations printed do not align with the problem's requirements. Specifically, the operations are not correctly setting the matrix elements to achieve the maximum possible sum.

Given the problem constraints and the goal of maximizing the sum of the matrix, the correct approach involves setting the matrix to have the highest possible values in a way that respects the operation constraints. The provided code does not achieve this.

Correctness: **False**
