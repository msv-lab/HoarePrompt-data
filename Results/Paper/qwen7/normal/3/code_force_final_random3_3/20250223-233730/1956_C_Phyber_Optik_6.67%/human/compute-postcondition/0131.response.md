Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is `2 * n + 2`
- `n` must be at least 1
- `r` must be at least `n + 1`
- The current value of `j` is less than or equal to `n`

From these conditions, let's deduce the value of `j`:

1. Since `j` is `2 * n + 2`, and `n` must be at least 1, the smallest possible value for `n` is 1.
2. If `n = 1`, then `j = 2 * 1 + 2 = 4`.
3. However, it is also stated that the current value of `j` is less than or equal to `n`. Given that `n` is at least 1 and `j` is `2 * n + 2`, this implies that `j` cannot be less than or equal to `n` unless `n` is specifically chosen such that `2 * n + 2 <= n`, which is not possible for any positive integer `n`.

Given the contradiction between `j = 2 * n + 2` and `j <= n`, the only way to satisfy both conditions is if `n` is set to a value that makes `j` equal to `n`. This can only happen if `n` is chosen such that `2 * n + 2 = n`, which simplifies to `n = -2`. However, since `n` must be at least 1, this scenario is impossible under the given constraints.

Therefore, the only feasible interpretation is that there might be a specific value of `n` that satisfies both conditions, but without a concrete value for `n`, we can infer that the smallest `n` that could possibly work is 1, leading to `j = 4`.

Thus, the print statement will output `1` followed by `4` with a space in between.

Output: **1 4**
