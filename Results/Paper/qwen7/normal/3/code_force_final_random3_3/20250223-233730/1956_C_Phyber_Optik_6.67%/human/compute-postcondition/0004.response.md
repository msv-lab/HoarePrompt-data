State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `sum` is 0, `r` is 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. The loop `for i in range(1, n + 1):` will start with `i` set to 1 and will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.
3. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0 because if `n` is 0 or negative, the range function will not generate any values for `i`.
4. The variable `i` is initialized to 1 within the loop, so no adjustment is needed for `i` before the loop starts.
5. The variables `sum` and `r` are not used to determine the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the only adjustments needed are to ensure `n` is greater than 0, and to initialize `i` to 1, while keeping `sum` and `r` as they are.
