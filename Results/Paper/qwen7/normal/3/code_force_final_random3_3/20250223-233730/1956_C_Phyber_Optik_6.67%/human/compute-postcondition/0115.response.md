Output State: **`j` remains 2 * n + 2, `n` must still be at least 1, `r` is now `i`, `t` remains t - n * n, `sum` is updated to sum + n * (n + 1) // 2.**

Explanation: The code updates the `sum` variable by adding the value of `n * (n + 1) // 2` to it. Since `n` must still be at least 1, the value of `j` remains unchanged as `2 * n + 2`. The value of `r` is set to `i`, which is 3. The value of `t` remains unchanged as `t - n * n`. The value of `sum` is updated based on the new value of `i` (3) and the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > 3 * n`.
