Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `arr[i]` is greater than 0; `mex` now contains the minimum value of `arr[i]`.**

Explanation: The line `mex.append(minn)` appends the value of `minn` to the list `mex`. Since `minn` is the minimum value of `arr[i]` (as per the precondition), `mex` now contains this value. The values of `i`, `n`, and `arr[i]` remain unchanged as no operations were performed on them directly within this line of code.
