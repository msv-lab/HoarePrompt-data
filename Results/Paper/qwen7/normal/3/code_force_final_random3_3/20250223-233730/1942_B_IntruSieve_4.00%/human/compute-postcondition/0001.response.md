Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of `n` integers such that -`n` ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`, and `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input and converts each integer to a list of integers. The original list `a` remains unchanged, and a new list `arr` is created with the same elements. The values of `t` and `n` remain the same as they were in the initial state.
