Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `arr[i]` is greater than 0; `mex` now contains the minimum value of `arr[i]`; `minn` is 2; the current value of `minn` is equal to the current value of `maxx` + 1.**

Explanation: The code updates `minn` to be `maxx + 1`. Since the initial state had `minn` equal to `maxx`, and the problem statement mentions that the current value of `minn` is equal to the current value of `maxx`, we can deduce that `minn` is now `maxx + 1`. Given that `maxx` was initially equal to `minn`, `minn` is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state description.
