### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires moving chips to the left until they form a single block without any free cells between them. The objective is to find the minimum number of operations needed to achieve this.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and a string `arr` representing the initial state of the cells (where '1' indicates a chip and '0' indicates a free cell).
   - It then finds the first occurrence of '1' (using `arr.find('1')`) and the last occurrence of '1' (using `arr[::-1].find('1')`).
   - It extracts a substring `z` from `x` to `n - y` (where `y` is the index of the last '1' from the end).
   - Finally, it counts the number of '0's in this substring and prints the count.

3. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The logic of counting '0's in the extracted substring does not correctly represent the minimum number of operations required to move all chips to form a single block.
   - The count of '0's does not account for the actual movement of chips. It only counts the number of free cells in a specific segment, which is not relevant to the minimum operations needed.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this problem, we need to count the number of operations required to move all chips to the leftmost possible position.
   - This involves counting the number of '0's (free cells) between the first and last '1' in the string representation of the cells.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
