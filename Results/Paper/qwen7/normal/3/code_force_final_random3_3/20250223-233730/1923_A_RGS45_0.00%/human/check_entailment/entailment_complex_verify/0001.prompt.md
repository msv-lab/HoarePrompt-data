You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = str(input(''))
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; the second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is either 0 or 1, indicating whether the i-th cell is free (0) or contains a chip (1); in each test case, at least one cell contains a chip.
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        
        arr = str(input(''))
        
        x = arr.find('1')
        
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        
        print(z.count('0'))
        
    #State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 998, `_` is `t-1`, `n` is the integer input by the user in the last iteration, `arr` is the string input by the user in the last iteration, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is a substring from `arr[x]` to `arr[n - y - 1]` if both `x` and `n - y` are valid indices, otherwise `z` is an empty string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer t, followed by t pairs of integers n and a string arr. For each pair, it finds the first and last positions of '1' in arr, extracts the substring between these positions, and counts the number of '0's in this substring. It then prints the count for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires moving chips to the left until they form a single block without any free cells between them. The objective is to find the minimum number of operations needed to achieve this.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and a string `arr` representing the initial state of the cells (where '1' indicates a chip and '0' indicates a free cell).
   - It then finds the first occurrence of '1' (using `arr.find('1')`) and the last occurrence of '1' (using `arr[::-1].find('1')`).
   - It extracts a substring `z` from `x` to `n - y` (where `y` is the index of the last '1' from the end).
   - Finally, it counts the number of '0's in this substring and prints the count.

3. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The logic of counting '0's in the extracted substring does not correctly represent the minimum number of operations required to move all chips to form a single block.
   - The count of '0's does not account for the actual movement of chips. It only counts the number of free cells in a specific segment, which is not relevant to the minimum operations needed.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this problem, we need to count the number of operations required to move all chips to the leftmost possible position.
   - This involves counting the number of '0's (free cells) between the first and last '1' in the string representation of the cells.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
