Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and it is equal to the input integer from the user; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; the second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is either 0 or 1, indicating whether the i-th cell is free (0) or contains a chip (1); in each test case, at least one cell contains a chip.**

This output state indicates that the variable `t` has been updated to the integer input by the user, while the other conditions and variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
