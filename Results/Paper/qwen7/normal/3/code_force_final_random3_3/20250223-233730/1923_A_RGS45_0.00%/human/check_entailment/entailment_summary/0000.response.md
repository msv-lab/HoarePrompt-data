Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Operations**: The program simply counts the number of '0's (free cells) between the first and last '1's in the string `arr`. However, the goal is to move the chips to form a single block with no free cells between them, which requires a different approach.

2. **Misinterpretation of Chip Movement**: The program does not simulate the actual movement of chips to achieve the desired configuration. Instead, it just counts the number of free cells between the first and last chip, which does not reflect the minimum number of operations needed.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when all chips are already in a single block or when the first or last cell is occupied by a chip.

4. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic to find the first and last positions of '1's and then count the '0's in between is flawed because it does not account for the necessary movements of chips to achieve the desired configuration.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
