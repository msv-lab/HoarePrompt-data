Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 998, `_` is `t-1`, `n` is the integer input by the user in the last iteration, `arr` is the string input by the user in the last iteration, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is a substring from `arr[x]` to `arr[n - y - 1]` if both `x` and `n - y` are valid indices, otherwise `z` is an empty string.**

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `t` will be decremented by the number of iterations, so it will be `t-1`. The loop variable `_` will be equal to `t-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `t-1`. The values of `n` and `arr` will be the inputs from the last iteration of the loop since these values are redefined in each iteration. The variables `x`, `y`, and `z` will hold the values determined from the final input string `arr` as described.
