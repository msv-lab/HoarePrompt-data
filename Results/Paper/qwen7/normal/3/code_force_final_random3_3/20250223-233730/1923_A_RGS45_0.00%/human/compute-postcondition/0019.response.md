Output State: **`arr` is the new string input by the user, `t` is an integer between 1 and 999, `_` is 1, `n` is the integer input by the user, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is an empty string.**

Explanation: The code `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` finds the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the reversed string `arr[::-1]`. If '1' is not found, it returns -1. This value is then assigned to `y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
