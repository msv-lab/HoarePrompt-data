Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 999, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string input by the user, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr` or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in `arr` (if '1' is present) or -1 if '1' is not found, `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending at index `n - y - 1` if both `x` and `n - y` are valid indices, otherwise `z` is an empty string, `n` is updated to an input integer, `arr` is updated to a string input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `arr = str(input(''))` updates the variable `arr` to a string input by the user. It does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged from their initial states.
