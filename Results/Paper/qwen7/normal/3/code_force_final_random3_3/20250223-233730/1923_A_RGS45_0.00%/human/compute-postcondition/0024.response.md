Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer t, followed by t pairs of integers n and a string arr. For each pair, it finds the first and last positions of '1' in arr, extracts the substring between these positions, and counts the number of '0's in this substring. It then prints the count for each test case.**
