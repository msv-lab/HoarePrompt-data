Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block. The logic in the program is flawed because it does not account for the positions of the chips and the free cells correctly.

For instance, consider the input:
```
5
8
0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
```
The program finds the first '1' at index 1 and the last '1' at index 6, then calculates `z` as `arr[1:6]`, which is `"1110"`. It then counts the number of zeros in this substring, which is `1`. However, the correct solution involves moving the chip at position 7 to position 5, which requires only 1 operation, as described in the example note.

The program fails to consider the optimal strategy for moving chips to minimize the number of operations. It simply counts the number of free cells between the first and last chip, which does not always yield the minimum number of operations needed.
