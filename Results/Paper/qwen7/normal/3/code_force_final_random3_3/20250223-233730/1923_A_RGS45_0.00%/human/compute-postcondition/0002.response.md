Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code takes an input and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The variable `_` remains unchanged and is still 0. The value of `t` is also unchanged and remains an integer between 1 and 1000.
