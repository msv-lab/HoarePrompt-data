Output State: **`ans` is equal to `ans * (a[3] - a[2]) * (a[4] - a[3])`, `i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by multiplying it with the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 4, `ans` is now multiplied by `(a[4] - a[3])`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
