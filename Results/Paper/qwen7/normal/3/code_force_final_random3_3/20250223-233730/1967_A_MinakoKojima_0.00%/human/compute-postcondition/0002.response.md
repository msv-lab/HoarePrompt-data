Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `n` is the first integer input split from the input string, `k` is the second integer input split from the input string, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes the input as a string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
