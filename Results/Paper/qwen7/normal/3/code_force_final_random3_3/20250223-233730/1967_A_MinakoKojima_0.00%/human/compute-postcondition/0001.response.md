Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `n` is the first integer input split from the input string, `k` is the second integer input split from the input string.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into two integers, and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
