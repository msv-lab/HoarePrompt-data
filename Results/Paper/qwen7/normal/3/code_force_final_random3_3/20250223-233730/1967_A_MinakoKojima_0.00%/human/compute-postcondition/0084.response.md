Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `ans` is multiplied by `a[1] - a[0]`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 2, for the loop to continue, `i` must be incremented to 3.
   - `n` must remain greater than 1 because it was already specified that `n` must be greater than 1 at the end of the previous iteration.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be 3.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`ans` is multiplied by `a[1] - a[0]`, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1**
