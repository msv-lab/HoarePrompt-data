Output State: **`ans` is multiplied by `a[1] - a[0]` * (a[3] - a[2]), `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by multiplying it with the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is 3, `a[i]` is `a[3]` and `a[i - 1]` is `a[2]`. Therefore, `ans` is now multiplied by `(a[3] - a[2])`. The other variables remain unchanged, so `i` is still 3 and `n` must still be greater than 1.
