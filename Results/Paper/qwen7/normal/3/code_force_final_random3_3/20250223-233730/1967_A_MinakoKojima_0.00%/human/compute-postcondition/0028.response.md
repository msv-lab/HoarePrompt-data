Output State: `ans` is multiplied by the product of differences between consecutive elements in the array `a` from index 1 to `n-1`.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `ans` will be the initial value of `ans` (which is `a[0]`) multiplied by the product of the differences between each pair of consecutive elements in the array `a` from index 1 to `n-1`.
