You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program:
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
    return ma - mi + 2



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a string `s` containing characters 'W' and 'B', where at least one character is 'B'. It calculates and returns the difference between the length of the string `s` minus the distance from the end of the string to the first occurrence of 'B', plus 2.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()` and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is supposed to find the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white to make all cells white.
   - Variables `ma` and `mi` are initialized to 0.
   - `m` is read as the length of the strip, and `s` is read as the string representing the strip.
   - Variables `c` and `d` are initialized to 0.
   - Lists `l` is initialized but not used in the current implementation.
   - Two loops are used to find the positions of the first and last black cells:
     - The first loop (`for j in s:`) iterates through the string `s` from left to right.
     - If a black cell ('B') is found, `mi` is set to the count of white cells encountered so far (`c`), and the loop breaks.
     - The second loop (`for j in s[::-1]:`) iterates through the string `s` from right to left.
     - If a black cell ('B') is found, `ma` is set to the distance from the end of the string to the black cell (`len(s) - d`), and the loop breaks.
   - Finally, the function returns `ma - mi + 2`.

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation:**
   - The logic for finding the minimum length of the segment is flawed.
   - The variable `mi` is set to the count of white cells before the first black cell, which does not correctly represent the position of the first black cell.
   - Similarly, `ma` is set to the distance from the end of the string to the first black cell from the right, which does not correctly represent the position of the last black cell.
   - The formula `ma - mi + 2` is incorrect because it does not account for the actual positions of the first and last black cells.

2. **Example Test Cases:**
   - Let's test the program with the provided examples:
     - For the strip "WBBWBW":
       - First black cell is at position 2 (index 1).
       - Last black cell is at position 5 (index 4).
       - The correct answer should be 4, but the program returns 6 (5 - 1 + 2).
     - For the strip "BBW":
       - First black cell is at position 1 (index 0).
       - Last black cell is at position 2 (index 1).
       - The correct answer should be 2, but the program returns 4 (2 - 0 + 2).

### Correct Solution:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the positions of the first and last black cells and calculate the distance between them.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
n = int(input())
for _ in range(n):
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    first_black = s.find('B')
    last_black = s.rfind('B')
    if first_black == -1 or last_black == -1:
        print(m)
    else:
        print(last_black - first_black + 1)
```

### Conclusion:

The given program is incorrect due to the flawed logic for calculating the minimum segment length. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
