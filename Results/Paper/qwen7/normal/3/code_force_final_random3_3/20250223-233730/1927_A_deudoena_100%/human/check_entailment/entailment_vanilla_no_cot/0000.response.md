Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not accurately calculate the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white to turn all cells white. The current implementation only considers the first and last black cells and calculates a fixed distance between them plus two, which is incorrect.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    # Find the first and last index of black cells
    start = None
    end = None
    for i, cell in enumerate(s):
        if cell == 'B':
            if start is None:
                start = i
            end = i
    # If there are no black cells, the entire strip is already white
    if start is None:
        return 0
    # The minimum length is the distance between the first and last black cell + 1
    return end - start + 1
```

This corrected version properly identifies the first and last black cells and calculates the minimum segment length needed to turn all cells white.
