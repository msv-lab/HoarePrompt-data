Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes the following: an integer `t` (though not passed as a parameter), for each test case, an integer `n`, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where at least one character is 'B'. It returns the difference between the length of string `s` minus `d` and the length of string `s`, plus 2.**

Note: The integer `t` is mentioned in the constraints but is not passed as a parameter to the function `func_1`. It seems to be part of the context or loop count for processing multiple test cases.
