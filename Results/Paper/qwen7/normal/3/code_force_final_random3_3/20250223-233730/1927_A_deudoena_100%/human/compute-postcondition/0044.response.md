Postcondition: `d` is 3, `ma` is the length of the string `s` - 3, `mi` is the length of the string `s`, `m` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty string starting with 'B', `c` is the length of the string `s`, the current value of `j` is the first character of the original string `s`, and `l` is an empty list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
