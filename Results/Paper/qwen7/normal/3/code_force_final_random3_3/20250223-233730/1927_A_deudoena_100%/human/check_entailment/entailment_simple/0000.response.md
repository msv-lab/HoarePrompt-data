Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is defined to process each test case. However, the logic inside the function does not accurately solve the problem as described.

3. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The function initializes `ma` and `mi` to 0.
   - It then reads the integer `m` and the string `s`.
   - The first loop (`for j in s:`) iterates through the string `s` to find the first occurrence of 'B' and sets `mi` to the position (index + 1) of the first 'B'. If no 'B' is found, `mi` remains 0, which is incorrect since it should be the length of the string `s` + 1.
   - The second loop (`for j in s[::-1]:`) iterates through the string `s` in reverse to find the last occurrence of 'B' and sets `ma` to the length of the string `s` - `d`. Again, this is incorrect because `d` is incremented regardless of whether 'B' is found or not, and the logic to update `ma` is flawed.

4. **Return Statement**:
   - The return statement `return ma - mi + 2` is incorrect. The logic to calculate the minimum segment length is not implemented properly. The function should find the minimum segment length that includes all black cells.

Given these issues, the function does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
