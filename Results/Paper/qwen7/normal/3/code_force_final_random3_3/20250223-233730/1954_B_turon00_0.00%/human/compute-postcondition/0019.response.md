Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, and the first element of `a` is not equal to `tmp`.**

Explanation: The line `cnt = 0` sets the value of `cnt` to 0. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, and `tmp`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still 0, `n` must still be greater than 0, and the first element of `a` is not equal to `tmp`.
