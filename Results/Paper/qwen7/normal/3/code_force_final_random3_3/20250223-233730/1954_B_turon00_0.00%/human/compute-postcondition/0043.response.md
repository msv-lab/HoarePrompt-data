Postcondition: `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`; `cnt` is 0; `i` is equal to `n`; `t` is `t-1`; `a` is a list of integers entered by the user; `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`; `aa` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `a`. If the set `aa` contains exactly one unique element, then `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`. Otherwise, the values of `ans`, `cnt`, `i`, `t`, `a`, `tmp`, and `aa` remain unchanged.
