Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `cnt` is `cnt + 1`**

Explanation: The variable `cnt` is incremented by 1. The initial state of `i` is `i + 1` and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`. After executing `cnt += 1`, `cnt` is updated to `cnt + 1`. The conditions and values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
