Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to `n`.
   - `n` is a variable that determines the number of iterations.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n`. Since `i` starts at `n`, the loop will not execute if `n` is less than or equal to 0.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute, `n` must be greater than 0.
   - The value of `i` will be updated within the loop, but initially, it should be `n`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0**
