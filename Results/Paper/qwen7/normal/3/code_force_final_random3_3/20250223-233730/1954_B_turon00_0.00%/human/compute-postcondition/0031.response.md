Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`, `cnt` is 0**.

Explanation: The code initializes `cnt` to 0. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum between its previous value and `cnt`, which is now 0.
