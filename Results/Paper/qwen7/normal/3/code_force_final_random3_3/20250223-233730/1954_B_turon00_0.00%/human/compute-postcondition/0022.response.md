Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables and conditions:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `cnt` is incremented by 1 if `a[i]` equals `tmp`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0.
   - The first element of `a` is not equal to `tmp`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration:**
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must remain greater than 1 (since `i` is now 1).
   - The value of `cnt` will depend on whether `a[1]` equals `tmp`. If it does, `cnt` will be incremented by 1; otherwise, it will remain the same as the previous value.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly:**
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `cnt` will either be the previous value plus 1 or the previous value, depending on whether `a[1]` equals `tmp`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, and `cnt` is incremented by 1 if `a[1]` equals `tmp`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains the same as the previous value.**
