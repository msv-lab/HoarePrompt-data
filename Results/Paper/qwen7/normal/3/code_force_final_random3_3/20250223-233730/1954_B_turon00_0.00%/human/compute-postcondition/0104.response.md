Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` holds the minimum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop execution.
- `cnt` is initialized to 0.
- `i` is equal to `n`.
- `tmp` retains its initial value (though the initial value of `tmp` is not specified, it does not affect the value of `ans`).
- `a` remains as the list of integers provided initially (though the list `a` itself is not specified, it does not affect the value of `ans`).

Since `cnt` starts at 0 and no other operations modify `cnt` or `ans` before the `print(ans)` statement, `ans` must also be 0.

Output: **0**
