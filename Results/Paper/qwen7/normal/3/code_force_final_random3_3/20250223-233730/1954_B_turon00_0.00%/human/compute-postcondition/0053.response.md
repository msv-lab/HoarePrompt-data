Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, `i` is less than `n`, `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 0**

Explanation: The code sets `cnt` to 0, which updates the value of `cnt`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
