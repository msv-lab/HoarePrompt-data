Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from the array to make it non-beautiful. Here's why:

1. **Logic for Checking Beauty**: The current implementation checks if all elements are the same initially and prints `-1` if they are. However, this is not sufficient. We need to ensure that after removing some elements, the array cannot be made beautiful anymore.

2. **Counting Consecutive Elements**: The code counts consecutive elements that are the same but does not handle the removal of elements to break the beauty condition properly.

3. **Finding Minimum Removals**: The solution should identify segments where removing one element breaks the beauty condition. It should then count the minimum number of such removals needed.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        # Identify segments where removing one element would break the beauty condition
        segments = []
        i = 0
        while i < n:
            start = i
            while i < n and a[i] == a[start]:
                i += 1
            if i - start > 1:
                segments.append((start, i))
        
        # If there are no segments of length > 1, the array is already not beautiful
        if not segments:
            print(-1)
        else:
            # Find the segment that requires the minimum removals to break the beauty condition
            min_removals = float('inf')
            for start, end in segments:
                # Removing one element from the middle of the segment breaks the beauty condition
                min_removals = min(min_removals, end - start - 1)
            
            print(min_removals)

func()
```

This corrected version identifies segments of consecutive identical elements and determines the minimum number of removals required to break the beauty condition.
