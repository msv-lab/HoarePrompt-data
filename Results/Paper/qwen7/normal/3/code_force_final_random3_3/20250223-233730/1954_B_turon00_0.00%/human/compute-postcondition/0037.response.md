Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(t)`. The key variables here are `t`, which is used as the upper limit for the range function.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop runs `t` times. At the end of each iteration, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, and `cnt` is reset to 0. The variable `i` is set to `n`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs based on `t`, the only variable that needs to be adjusted for the next iteration is `t`. Specifically, `t` should be decremented by 1 because the loop runs from 0 to `t-1`.
   - The variables `ans`, `cnt`, and `i` are reset or updated within the loop body and do not affect the condition for the next iteration of the loop.

4. **Formulate the new state**: Given that `t` is the only variable that controls the loop execution and it should be decremented by 1 for the next iteration, the new state should reflect this.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, `cnt` is 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `t` is `t-1`**
