Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` should be initialized to 0 because `range(n)` generates numbers starting from 0 up to (but not including) `n`.
   - `n` is already given as an input integer.

3. **Adjust the states based on the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, as `range(n)` will generate numbers only if `n` is positive.

4. **Consider the other variables**:
   - `cnt`, `t`, `a`, `tmp`, `aa`, and `ans` are not part of the loop head and their values do not affect whether the loop can execute. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
