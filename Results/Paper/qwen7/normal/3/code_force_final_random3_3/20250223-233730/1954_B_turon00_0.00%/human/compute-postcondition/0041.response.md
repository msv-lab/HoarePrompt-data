Output State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`; `cnt` is 0; `i` is equal to `n`; `t` is `t-1`; `a` is a list of integers entered by the user; `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`; `aa` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `a`.**

Explanation: The line `aa = set(a)` creates a set from the list `a`, which removes any duplicate elements in `a`. The values of `ans`, `cnt`, `i`, `t`, `a`, and `tmp` remain unchanged from their initial states.
