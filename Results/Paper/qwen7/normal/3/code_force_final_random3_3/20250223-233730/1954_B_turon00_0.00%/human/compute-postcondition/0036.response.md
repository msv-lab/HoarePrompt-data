Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state defines that `ans` is updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`.
2. It also states that `cnt` is 0.
3. Additionally, `i` is equal to `n`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the print statement:

- Since `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is being updated to the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`, if `ans` is initially greater than 0, it will be updated to 0 after this operation.
- If `ans` is already 0 or negative, it remains unchanged.

Therefore, after the update, `ans` will be 0.

Output: **0**
