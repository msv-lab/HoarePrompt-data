Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

3. **Analyze the Postconditions**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`).
   - `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.
   - `ans` is assigned the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`.
   - `cnt` is either incremented by 1 if `a[i] == tmp` is true or reset to 0.

4. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is incremented by 1 from the previous iteration.
   - `n` must still be greater than `i + 1` (which is now `i + 2`).

5. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be the old value of `i` plus 1.
   - `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`, which is `i + 2`.

6. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `i` is updated to `i + 1`.
   - `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, which means it must be greater than `i + 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`**.
