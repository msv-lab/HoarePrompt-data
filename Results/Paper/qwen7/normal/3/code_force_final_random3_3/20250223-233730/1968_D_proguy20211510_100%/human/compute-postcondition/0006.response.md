Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `pb` is an integer from input, `ps` is an integer from input, `P_S` is an unchanged positive integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input string, `a` is an unchanged array of positive integers, `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `YES` is 'YES', `NO` is 'NO', `MOD` is 1000000007.**

The code `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `p`. The other variables remain unchanged.
