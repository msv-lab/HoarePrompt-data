Output State: **`i` is 0, `len(pathb)` is a positive integer, `curr` is `preb + pathb[0] * (k - 0)`, `preb` is `preb + pathb[0]`**

Explanation: The code `preb += pathb[i]` increments the value of `preb` by `pathb[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `preb` is updated to `preb + pathb[0]`. The values of `len(pathb)`, `curr`, and `i` remain unchanged.
