Output State: **`vis` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros except for the index `pb - 1` which is set to 1, `i` is equal to `len(paths)`, `curr` is `pres + a[pb - 1] * (k - len(paths) + 1)`, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, `ress` stores the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `n` is the first input string converted to integer, `k` is the second input string converted to integer, `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is the fourth input string converted to integer, `pathb` is a list containing `a[pb - 1]` followed by `a[pb - 1]` and an additional element `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, `vis[pb - 1]` remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change any variable values but instead exits the current loop or conditional block. All other variables retain their previous values as specified in the initial state.
