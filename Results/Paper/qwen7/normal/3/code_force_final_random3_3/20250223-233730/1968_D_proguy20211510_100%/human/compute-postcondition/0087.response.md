Output State: **`pres` is equal to `paths[4] * (k - 3)`, `curr` is the result of `pres + paths[4] * (k - 4)`, `ress` is the maximum of `ress` and `curr`, `i` is `i + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block without changing the values of the variables `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, and `i`. The only change is that we are now outside the loop or conditional block.
