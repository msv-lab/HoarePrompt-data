Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `vis[ps - 1]` is marked as visited (set to 1), `vis` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros except for `vis[ps - 1]`, `i` is equal to `len(paths)`, `curr` is `pres + a[pb - 1] * (k - len(paths) + 1)`, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, `ress` stores the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `n` is the first input string converted to integer, `k` is the second input string converted to integer, `pb` is the last value it was updated to before breaking the loop, `ps` is the fourth input string converted to integer, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of elements added during the loop execution, `paths` is an empty list, and `vis[pb - 1]` is marked as visited (set to 1).
Code of the loop:
while True:
    paths.append(a[ps - 1])
    ps = p[ps - 1]
    if vis[ps - 1] == 1:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `total` is 10, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `curr` is undefined, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, `ress` stores the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `k` is the second input string converted to integer, `pb` is the last value it was updated to before breaking the loop, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of elements added during the loop execution, `paths` is now `[a[ps - 1]]`, and `vis[pb - 1]` is marked as visited (set to 1). If `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `total` is 10, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `curr` is undefined, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, `ress` stores the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `k` is the second input string converted to integer, `pb` is the last value it was updated to before breaking the loop, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of elements added during the loop execution, `paths` is now `[a[ps - 1], a[ps - 1]]`, and `vis[pb - 1]` is marked as visited (set to 1). If `vis[ps - 1]` is already visited, the loops or if statements are exited.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `total` is 10, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `curr` is undefined, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, `ress` stores the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `k` is the second input string converted to integer, `pb` is the last value it was updated to before breaking the loop, `ps` is now `p[ps - 1]`, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of elements added during the loop execution, `paths` is now `[a[ps - 1], a[ps - 1], a[ps - 1]]`, and `vis[pb - 1]` is marked as visited (set to 1). If `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
