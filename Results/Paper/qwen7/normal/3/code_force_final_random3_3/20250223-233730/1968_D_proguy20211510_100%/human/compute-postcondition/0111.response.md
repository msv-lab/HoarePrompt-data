Postcondition: **`pres` is the sum of `paths[4] * (k - 3)`, `paths[5]`, and `paths[6]` up to the last element where the condition `k < i + 1` holds true, `curr` is calculated based on the current value of `pres` and the current element of `paths`, `ress` keeps track of the maximum value of `curr` encountered during the loop's execution, `i` is equal to the length of `paths`, and `resb` is either greater than or equal to `ress`.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether `resb` is greater than or less than or equal to `ress`, the final states of `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, and `i` remain consistent with the loop's termination condition and the calculations performed within the if-else block.
