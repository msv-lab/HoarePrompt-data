Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `total` is 10, `i` equals `len(pathb)` (indicating the loop has completed all iterations), `n` is an integer, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, `ress` is the maximum value between `ress` and `curr` for all iterations, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `k` is the second input string converted to integer, `pb` is the last value it was updated to before breaking the loop (which in this case never happens since `i` reaches `len(pathb)`), `ps` is now the final value of `p[ps - 1]` after the loop, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of elements added during the loop execution, `paths` is now a list of `k` elements, each being `a[ps - 1]`, `vis[pb - 1]` is marked as visited (set to 1), `resb` is equal to the maximum value of `curr` calculated over all iterations, `ress` is the same as `resb`.

This output state reflects that the loop has completed all its iterations, with `i` reaching the length of `pathb`. The value of `preb` is the cumulative sum of all elements in `pathb` due to the additions performed in the loop. `resb` and `ress` store the maximum value of `curr` computed during each iteration.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(paths)):
    if k < i + 1:
        break
    curr = pres + paths[i] * (k - i)
    pres += paths[i]
    ress = max(ress, curr)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `total` is 10, `i` is less than `len(paths)`, `n` is an integer, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths` plus `paths[i]`, `ress` is the maximum value between `ress` and `curr` for all iterations, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `k` is the second input string converted to integer, `pb` is the last value it was updated to before breaking the loop (which in this case never happens), `ps` is now the final value of `p[ps - 1]` after the loop, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of elements added during the loop execution, `paths` is now a list of `k` elements, each being `a[ps - 1]`, `vis[pb - 1]` is marked as visited (set to 1), `resb` is equal to the maximum value of `curr` calculated over all iterations, `ress` is equal to `resb`, `curr` is equal to `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`; `ress` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `total` is 10, `i` is less than `len(paths)`, `n` is an integer, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths` plus `paths[i]`, `ress` is the maximum value between `ress` and `curr` for all iterations, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `k` is the second input string converted to integer, `pb` is the last value it was updated to before breaking the loop (which in this case never happens), `ps` is now the final value of `p[ps - 1]` after the loop, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of elements added during the loop execution, `paths` is now a list of `k` elements, each being `a[ps - 1]`, `vis[pb - 1]` is marked as visited (set to 1), `resb` is equal to the maximum value of `curr` calculated over all iterations, `ress` is updated to `max(ress, curr)`, and we break out of the loop if `k < i + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `total` is 10, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is an integer, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths` plus `paths[i]` increased by `paths[i]`, `ress` is the maximum value between `ress` and `curr` for all iterations, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `k` is the second input string converted to integer, `pb` is the last value it was updated to before breaking the loop (which in this case never happens), `ps` is now the final value of `p[ps - 1]` after the loop, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of elements added during the loop execution, `paths` is now a list of `k` elements, each being `a[ps - 1]`, `vis[pb - 1]` is marked as visited (set to 1), `resb` is equal to the maximum value of `curr` calculated over all iterations, `curr` is equal to `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`; `ress` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
