Output State: **`resb` is equal to `max(resb, curr)`, `curr` is equal to `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`, and if `k < i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `curr` to `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`. It does not affect the relationship between `resb` and `curr`, which is maintained by the previous condition. The condition `if k < i + 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement` remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated values are as stated above.
