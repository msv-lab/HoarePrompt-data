State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S` are positive integers, `p` is a permutation of length `n`, `a` is an array of positive integers, `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `YES` is 'YES', `NO` is 'NO', `MOD` is 1000000007, input is a function call that returns an integer**

Explanation:
- The loop is controlled by the value returned by `int(input())`.
- The variable `t` represents the number of test cases, but since the loop runs based on user input, `t` does not directly control the loop's execution.
- The loop will run as long as `int(input())` returns a positive integer (since `t` is a positive integer).
- Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input itself, which should return a positive integer to ensure the loop executes.

So, the state before the loop starts should include the condition that the input function returns a positive integer.
