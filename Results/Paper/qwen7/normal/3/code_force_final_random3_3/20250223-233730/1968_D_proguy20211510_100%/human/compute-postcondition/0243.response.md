Postcondition: **`vis` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros except for the index `pb - 1` which is set to 1, `i` is equal to `len(paths)`, `curr` is `pres + a[pb - 1] * (k - len(paths) + 1)`, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, `ress` stores the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `n` is the first input string converted to integer, `k` is the second input string converted to integer, `pb` remains unchanged, `ps` is the fourth input string converted to integer, `pathb` is a list containing `a[pb - 1]` appended with `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, and `vis[pb - 1]` remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This postcondition describes the state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block. It states that the `vis` list remains unchanged except for the `pb - 1` index, which is still set to 1. The other variables (`i`, `curr`, `pres`, `ress`, `a`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `pathb`, and `paths`) remain as they were before the execution of the if-else block, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.
