Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, `curr` is undefined, `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths`, `ress` stores the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `k` is the second input string converted to integer, `pb` is the last value it was updated to before breaking the loop, `ps` is now `p[ps - 1]`, `pathb` is a list containing the sequence of elements added during the loop execution, `paths` is now `[a[ps - 1], a[ps - 1], a[ps - 1]]`, and `vis[pb - 1]` is marked as visited (set to 1), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but indicates that the program has exited the innermost loop or conditional block. All other variables retain their previous values as per the initial state.
