Output State: **`i` is `i_end + 1`; `curr` is `pres + paths[i_end + 1] * (k - (i_end + 1))`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `curr` with the value of `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`. Given the initial state where `i` is `i_end + 1`, the value of `i` in the expression becomes `i_end + 1`. Therefore, `curr` is set to `pres + paths[i_end + 1] * (k - (i_end + 1))`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.
