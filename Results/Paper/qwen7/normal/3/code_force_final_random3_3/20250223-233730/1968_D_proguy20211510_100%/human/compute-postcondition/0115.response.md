Output State: **`n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are now integers converted from their respective input values, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `i`, `resb`, and `p` (a list of integers) remain in their previous states.**

Explanation: The code `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `p`. The initial states of `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `i`, and `resb` remain unchanged.
