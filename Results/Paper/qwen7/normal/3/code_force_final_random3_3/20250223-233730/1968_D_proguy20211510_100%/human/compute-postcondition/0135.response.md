Postcondition: **`pathb` contains the value of `a[pb - 1]` appended to it, `paths` is an empty list, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are integers converted from their respective input values, `vis` is a list of n zeros where the element at index `pb - 1` is now 1, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, `i`, `resb`, and `p` remain in their previous states, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, `pb` is updated to the value of `p[pb - 1]`, and `vis[pb - 1]` is 1.**

This postcondition remains the same as the precondition because the if condition `vis[pb - 1] == 1` is always true according to the given information, and thus the if part is executed. Therefore, the state of all variables and lists remains unchanged as described in the precondition.
