Output State: **`curr` is equal to `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`, `pres` is increased by `paths[i]`, `k` is an integer, and if `k` is less than `i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `pres` by adding `paths[i]` to it. The initial state of `curr` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this line of code. The condition for breaking out of the loop or if statement also remains the same.
