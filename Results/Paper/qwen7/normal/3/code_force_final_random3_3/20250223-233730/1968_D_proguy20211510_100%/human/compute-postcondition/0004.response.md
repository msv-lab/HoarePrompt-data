Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is the first integer from input, `k` is the second integer from input, `P_B` is the third integer from input, `P_S` is an unchanged positive integer, `p` is an unchanged permutation of length `n`, `a` is an unchanged array of positive integers, `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `YES` is 'YES', `NO` is 'NO', `MOD` is 1000000007.**

The code splits the input into three parts and assigns them to `n`, `k`, and `P_B` respectively. The values of `t`, `P_S`, `p`, `a`, `alpha`, `YES`, `NO`, and `MOD` remain unchanged.
