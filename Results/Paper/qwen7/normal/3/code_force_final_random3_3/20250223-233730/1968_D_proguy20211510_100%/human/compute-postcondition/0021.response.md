Output State: **`vis` is a list of length `n` where all elements are 0 except for the element at index `pb - 1` which is 1, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer from input, `k` is an integer from input, `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is an integer from input, `P_S` is an unchanged positive integer, `p` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input string, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting the input string, `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `YES` is 'YES', `NO` is 'NO', `MOD` is 1000000007, `pathb` is a list containing the elements `a[pb - 1]` and `a[pb - 1]`, and `paths` is an unchanged empty list. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change any variable values but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it is within. Since no such loop or conditional was specified, the only change is that we know we have broken out of one. All other variables retain their initial states.
