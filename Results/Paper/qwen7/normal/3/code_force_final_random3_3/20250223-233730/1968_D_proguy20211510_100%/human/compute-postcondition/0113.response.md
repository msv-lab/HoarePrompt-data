Output State: **`n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces, `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, and `i` remain in their previous states, `resb` remains in its previous state.**

Explanation: The code `n, k, pb, ps = input().split()` takes a single line of input and splits it into four parts, assigning them to `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` respectively. The variables `pres`, `curr`, `ress`, and `i` are not affected by this operation, nor is `resb`. Therefore, they retain their previous values.
