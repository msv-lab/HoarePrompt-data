Output State: **`resb` is equal to `max(resb, curr)`, `curr` is equal to `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i) + pathb[i]`, and we are inside the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The line `resb = max(resb, curr)` updates `resb` to be the maximum of its current value (`resb`) and the new value of `curr`. The value of `curr` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the updated state includes `resb` being set to the maximum of its original value and the current value of `curr`, while `curr` retains its original value from before the line was executed.
