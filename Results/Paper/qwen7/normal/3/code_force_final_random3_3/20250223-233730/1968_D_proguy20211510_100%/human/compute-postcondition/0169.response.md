Output State: **`i` is 0, `len(pathb)` is a positive integer, `curr` is `preb + pathb[0] * (k - 0)`**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `curr` to the value of `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`. Given the initial state where `i` is 0, `len(pathb)` is a positive integer, and since `k` is less than `i + 1` (which is 1), the condition in the if statement is always false, so the program does not enter the if block and no changes are made to the variables. Therefore, `curr` is calculated as `preb + pathb[0] * (k - 0)`.
