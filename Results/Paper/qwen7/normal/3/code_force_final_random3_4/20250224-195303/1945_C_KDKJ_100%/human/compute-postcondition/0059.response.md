Output State: **`i` is the previous value of `i` plus 2; `left` equals `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `i`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`; `rsum` is `n - i`; `ans` is `i`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `ans`. All other variables (`i`, `left`, `lsum`, `right`, `rsum`) remain unchanged from their previous values.
