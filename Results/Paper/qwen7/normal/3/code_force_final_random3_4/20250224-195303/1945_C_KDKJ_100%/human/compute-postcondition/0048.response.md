The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no specific action is taken within the loop body except for the `continue` statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1 + 1`, `left` is `S[i][0]`, `lsum` is `i`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - i`, and `ans` is either 0 or the value that minimizes the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`, ensuring that the condition `(left * 2 >= lsum) and (right * 2 >= rsum)` still holds true.**
