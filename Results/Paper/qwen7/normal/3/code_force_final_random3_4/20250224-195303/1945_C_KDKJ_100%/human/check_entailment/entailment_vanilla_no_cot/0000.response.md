Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal position `i` for laying the road such that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` reads the number of houses `n` and the binary string `a` representing the preferences of the residents.
   - It initializes a list `S` to store the cumulative counts of residents preferring left (`0`) and right (`1`) sides.

2. **Cumulative Count Calculation**:
   - For each resident, it updates the cumulative counts of residents preferring left and right sides.
   - This is stored in the list `S`, where `S[i]` contains `[left_count, right_count]` up to the `i-th` resident.

3. **Finding the Optimal Position**:
   - It iterates through each possible position `i` from `0` to `n`.
   - For each position `i`, it calculates the number of residents on the left and right sides.
   - It checks if the number of satisfied residents on both sides meets the criteria (`left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum`).
   - If the criteria are met, it updates the answer `ans` if the current position `i` is closer to the middle of the village (`abs(n / 2 - i) < abs(n / 2 - ans)`).

4. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the optimal position `ans`.

5. **Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The function `func_2` handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

The logic and implementation are sound and correctly follow the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
