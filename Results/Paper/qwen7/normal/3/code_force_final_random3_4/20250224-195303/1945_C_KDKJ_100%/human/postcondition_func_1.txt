The function does not accept any parameters and does not return anything. It reads an integer `n` from user input, which must be between 3 and 300,000 inclusive, and then calls another function `func_1()` multiple times (specifically, the number of times equal to the value of `n`). After executing these calls, the function ends without returning any value.
