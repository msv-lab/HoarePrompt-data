Postcondition: **`i` is incremented by 2, `left` remains as `S[i][0]`, `lsum` remains as `i`, `right` remains as `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` remains as `n - i`, and `ans` is updated to `i` if the new `i` provides a smaller absolute difference with `n / 2`, while maintaining the condition `(left * 2 >= lsum) and (right * 2 >= rsum)`**.

This means that after the execution of the if-else block, `i` is incremented by 2, `left` remains unchanged as `S[i][0]`, `lsum` remains unchanged as `i`, `right` remains unchanged as `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` remains unchanged as `n - i`, and `ans` is updated to `i` if the new `i` results in a smaller absolute difference with `n / 2`, while ensuring that the condition `(left * 2 >= lsum) and (right * 2 >= rsum)` is still satisfied.
