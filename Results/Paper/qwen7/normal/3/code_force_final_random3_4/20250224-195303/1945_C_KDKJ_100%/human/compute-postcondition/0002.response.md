Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved here are the input value itself, which determines the number of iterations, and the loop counter (which is `_` in this case, but it doesn't affect the state since it's an underscore).

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\). No changes have been made to `n` by the function `func_1()`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as the input value is positive. Since the loop is defined by `range(int(input()))`, the loop will execute one more time if `int(input())` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state**: For the loop to execute one more time, the input value must be greater than 0. Since `n` is the only variable that could potentially change based on the input, and no changes have been made to `n` by `func_1()`, the only thing that can change is the input value itself.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the fact that the input value must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\) and the input value must be greater than 0**
