Output State: **The new value of `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 2; `left` equals `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `i`; `right`, `rsum`, and `ans` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `lsum = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `lsum`. Since `i` was updated to its previous value plus 2, `lsum` now holds that value. All other variables (`left`, `right`, `rsum`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
