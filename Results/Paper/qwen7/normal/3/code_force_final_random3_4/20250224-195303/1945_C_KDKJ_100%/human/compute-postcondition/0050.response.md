Postcondition: `i` is `i + 1 + 1`, `left` is `S[i][0]`, `lsum` is `i`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - i`, and `ans` is either `0` or the value that minimizes the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`, ensuring that the condition `(left * 2 >= lsum) and (right * 2 >= rsum)` still holds true, and if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is smaller than the current `ans`, then `ans` is updated to `i`.
