Output State: **`i` is 0, `left` is `S[0][0]`, `lsum` is 0, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[0][1]`, `rsum` is `n - i`, `ans` is 0**.

Explanation: The line `ans = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 0) to the variable `ans`. All other variables (`left`, `lsum`, `right`, `rsum`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The condition `(left * 2 >= lsum) and (right * 2 >= rsum)` and the condition `(abs(n / 2 - i) < abs(n / 2 - ans))` also remain valid as they were before the assignment.
