Output State: **`i` is 0; `left` is `S[0][0]`; `lsum` is 0; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[0][1]`; `rsum` is `n - i`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `n - i` to the variable `rsum`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `rsum` becomes `n - 0`, which simplifies to `n`. The values of `i`, `left`, `lsum`, and `right` remain unchanged from their initial states.
