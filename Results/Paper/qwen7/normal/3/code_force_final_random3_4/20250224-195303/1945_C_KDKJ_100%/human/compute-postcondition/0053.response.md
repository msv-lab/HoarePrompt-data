Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for i in range(n + 1):`. The only variable that changes within this loop is `i`.

2. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is incremented by 2.
   - `left` remains as `S[i][0]`.
   - `lsum` remains as `i`.
   - `right` remains as `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`.
   - `rsum` remains as `n - i`.
   - `ans` is updated to `i` if the new `i` provides a smaller absolute difference with `n / 2`, while maintaining the condition `(left * 2 >= lsum) and (right * 2 >= rsum)`.

3. **Determine the New Values for Each Variable:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 2, the new value of `i` will be the previous value of `i` plus 2.
   - `left` remains as `S[i][0]`, so it does not change.
   - `lsum` remains as `i`, so it does not change.
   - `right` remains as `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, so it does not change.
   - `rsum` remains as `n - i`, so it does not change.
   - `ans` is updated to `i` if the new `i` provides a smaller absolute difference with `n / 2`, but since we are determining the state before the update, we keep `ans` as its previous value.

4. **Formulate the New State:**
   - The new value of `i` is the previous value of `i` plus 2.
   - `left`, `lsum`, `right`, and `rsum` remain unchanged.
   - `ans` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is the previous value of `i` plus 2, `left` remains as `S[i][0]`, `lsum` remains as `i`, `right` remains as `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` remains as `n - i`, and `ans` remains as its previous value.**
