Output State: **`i` is the previous value of `i` plus 2; `left` equals `S[i][0]`; `lsum` is `i`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`; `rsum` and `ans` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `right` to be `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`. All other variables (`i`, `left`, `lsum`, `right`, `rsum`, and `ans`) retain their previous values.
