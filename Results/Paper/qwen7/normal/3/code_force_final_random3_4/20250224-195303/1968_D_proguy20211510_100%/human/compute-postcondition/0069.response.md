Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `pathb`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = len(pathb) - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

3. **Update the value of `i`**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `1 + 1 = 2`.

4. **Check the condition `k < 2`**:
   - This condition does not depend on `i` but rather on the initial value of `k`. Since the problem does not specify how `k` changes within the loop, we assume it remains unchanged or is not directly affected by `i`.

5. **Update the other relevant states**:
   - `preb` and `pathb[i]`: At the end of the previous iteration, `preb` is updated to `preb + pathb[i]` where `i` was 1. So, `preb` is now `preb + pathb[1]`.
   - `curr`: The formula for `curr` is `curr = preb + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`. Since `k` is less than 2, this formula holds true.
   - `resb`: The formula for updating `resb` is `resb = max(resb, curr)`. Since `curr` is already calculated, `resb` remains the same unless a new maximum is found.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- `i` will be 2.
- `k` remains less than 2.
- `preb` is updated to `preb + pathb[1]`.
- `curr` remains as `preb + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`.
- `resb` remains the same unless a new maximum is found.

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`i` is 2, `k` is less than 2, `curr` is `preb + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`, `preb` is `preb + pathb[1]`, `resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `curr`**
