Output State: **`i` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or switch statement. Since there was no loop or switch statement in the initial state, the `break` statement does not change the value of `i`. It simply indicates that if there had been such a structure, we would have exited it. Therefore, the value of `i` remains 2, and we know that a break occurred.
