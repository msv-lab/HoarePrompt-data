Output State: **`i` is 1 and `k` is less than 2; `curr` is `preb + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `curr` to be the sum of `preb` and `pathb[i]` multiplied by `(k - i)`. Given the initial state where `i` is 1 and `k` is less than 2, `curr` is calculated as `preb + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged as no assignment to them was made in the given code snippet.
