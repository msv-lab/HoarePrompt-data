The only variable in the loop head is the condition itself, which is `True`. Since the loop is `while True`, it will always execute again unless explicitly broken out of. Therefore, no adjustments to the states are necessary because the loop will continue to execute regardless of the current state of the variables.

State: **`input_value` must be a positive integer, `n` is the converted integer value of the first split value from input, `k` is the converted integer value of the second split value from input, `pb` is updated to the value of `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is the converted integer value of the fourth split value from input, `p` is a list containing `[a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3]]`, where `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `pathb` is a list containing the elements `a[pb - 1]` appended with `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `vis[pb - 1]` is equal to 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
