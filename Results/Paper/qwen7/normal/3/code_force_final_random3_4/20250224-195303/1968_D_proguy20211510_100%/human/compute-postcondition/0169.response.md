Output State: **`i` is 1, `preb` is `preb` + `pathb[0]` * (`k` - 0), `curr` is `preb` + `pathb[0]` * (`k` - 0), `resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `curr`**.

Explanation: The line `resb = max(resb, curr)` updates `resb` to be the maximum value between its current value and `curr`. Since `curr` is equal to `preb + pathb[0] * (k - 0)`, which simplifies to `preb + pathb[0] * k`, `resb` is now updated to this maximum value. The values of `i`, `preb`, `curr`, and `pathb[0]` remain unchanged from their initial states.
