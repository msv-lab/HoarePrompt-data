Output State: **`i` is 1, `curr` is `pres` + `paths[1]` * (`k` - 1), `pres` is `pres` + `paths[0]` + `paths[1]`, `ress` is the maximum of `ress` and `curr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since no loop or conditional block is explicitly mentioned, we assume it is part of a loop or conditional structure. After executing the `break` statement, the values of `i`, `curr`, `pres`, and `ress` remain unchanged from their initial states. We also note that the execution breaks out of the loop or conditional structure.
