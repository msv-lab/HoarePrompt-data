Output State: **`num_iterations` is decremented by 1, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are strings split from the input.**

The code splits the input into four variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`. Since the input is not specified, these variables will hold the first, second, third, and fourth parts of the input string respectively. The `num_iterations` variable is decremented by 1 as per the initial state.
