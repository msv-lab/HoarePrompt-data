Based on the given initial state and the code snippet, let's break down the variables and their values:

1. `i` is equal to the total number of elements in the `paths` list.
2. `curr` holds the value of `pres` plus the last element of `paths` multiplied by the difference between `k` and the index of the last element.
3. `pres` is the sum of all elements in the `paths` list.
4. `ress` contains the maximum value between its initial value and the calculated `curr` value for each iteration.
5. The value of `resb` is less than or equal to `ress`, and `ress` is not greater than `resb`.

The code snippet simply prints the string `'Draw'`. Since no other variables or values are printed, the only thing that will be printed is the string `'Draw'`.

Output: **Draw**
