Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is less than 2, `curr` is `preb + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`, `preb` is `preb + pathb[i]`, `resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `curr`**.

Explanation: The line `resb = max(resb, curr)` updates `resb` to be the maximum value between its current value and `curr`. The values of `i`, `k`, `curr`, and `preb` remain unchanged from their initial states.
