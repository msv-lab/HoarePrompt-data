Output State: **`input_value` must be a positive integer, `n` is the converted integer value of the first split value from input, `k` is the converted integer value of the second split value from input, `pb` is now the final value obtained after all iterations of the loop, `ps` is the converted integer value of the fourth split value from input, `p` is a list containing `[a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3]]`, `pathb` is a list containing the elements `a[pb - 1]` repeated as many times as the loop iterated, `paths` is a list containing the element `a[ps - 1]`, `vis` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros except for index `pb - 1` which is set to 1, and `vis` is now `[1, 0, 0, ..., 0]` (with 1 at index `pb - 1` and 0s elsewhere).**

Explanation: The line `paths.append(a[ps - 1])` appends the element `a[ps - 1]` to the list `paths`. Since `ps` is the converted integer value of the fourth split value from input, `a[ps - 1]` is the element at the position `ps - 1` in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
