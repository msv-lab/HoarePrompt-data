Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1; `curr` is equal to `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` if `k` is less than `i + 1`, otherwise `curr` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `curr` based on the formula `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`. This calculation only happens if `k` is less than `i + 1`. If `k` is not less than `i + 1`, `curr` remains unchanged. The increment of `i` by 1 is a precondition that is already given and is not affected by the current line of code.
