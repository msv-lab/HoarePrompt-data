Output State: **`i` is 4, `pathb` is a list with at least 4 elements, `preb` is `preb + pathb[4] * (k - 3)`, `curr` is `preb + pathb[4] * (k - 4)`, `resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `curr`.**

Explanation: The line `resb = max(resb, curr)` updates `resb` to be the maximum value between its current value and the value of `curr`. The values of `i`, `pathb`, `preb`, and `curr` remain unchanged from their initial states.
