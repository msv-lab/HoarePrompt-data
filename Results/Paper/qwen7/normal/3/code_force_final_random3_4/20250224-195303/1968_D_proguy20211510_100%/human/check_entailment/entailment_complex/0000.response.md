Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the input parameters for each test case, including \( n \), \( k \), \( P_B \), \( P_S \), the permutation \( p \), and the array \( a \).
2. It then constructs two paths for Bodya and Sasha based on their starting positions and the permutation \( p \).
3. The function calculates the maximum possible scores for both players using the formula `pre + path[i] * (k - i)` for each step in the path.
4. It compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').
5. The logic for calculating the scores and comparing them is correct and follows the problem statement accurately.

Given the above analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
