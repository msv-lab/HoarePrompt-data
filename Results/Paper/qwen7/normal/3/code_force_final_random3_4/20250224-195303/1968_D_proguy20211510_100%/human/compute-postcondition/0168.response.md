Output State: **`i` is 1, `preb` is `preb` + `pathb[0]` * (`k` - 0), `curr` is `preb` + `pathb[0]` * (`k` - 0)**

Explanation: The code `preb += pathb[i]` increments the value of `preb` by `pathb[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the value of `preb` is updated to `preb + pathb[1]`. Since `curr` was previously defined as `preb + pathb[0] * (k - 0)`, its value remains unchanged because `i` did not affect its calculation. Therefore, `i` remains 1, `preb` is updated to `preb + pathb[1]`, and `curr` remains `preb + pathb[0] * k`.
