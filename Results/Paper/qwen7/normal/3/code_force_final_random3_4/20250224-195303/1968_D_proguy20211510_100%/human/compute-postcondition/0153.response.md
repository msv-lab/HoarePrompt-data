Output State: **`vis[ps - 1]` is set to 1, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`, and `paths` has appended `a[ps - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `a[ps - 1]` to the list `paths`. The variables `vis[ps - 1]` and `ps` are updated as per their previous conditions, and `paths` now contains the new element.
