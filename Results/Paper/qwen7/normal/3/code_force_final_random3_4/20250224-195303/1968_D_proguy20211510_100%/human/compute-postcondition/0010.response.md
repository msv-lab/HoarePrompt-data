Output State: **`input_value` must be a positive integer, `n` is the converted integer value of the first split value from input, `k` is the converted integer value of the second split value from input, `pb` is the converted integer value of the third split value from input, `ps` is the converted integer value of the fourth split value from input, `p` is a list containing `[a[0], a[1], a[2], a[3]]`, where `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `pathb` is an empty list, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `vis[pb - 1] = 1`**.

This means that the value at index `pb - 1` in the `vis` list has been set to 1, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
