Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `len(paths)`. These are the only variables that can be adjusted.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 3.
   - `pres` is `pres` + `paths[3]`.
   - `ress` is the maximum of `ress` and `curr`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < len(paths)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(paths)`.

4. **Calculate the new value of `i`**: Since `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 4 for the next iteration.

5. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(paths)`. Therefore, `len(paths)` must be greater than 4.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be 4.
   - `len(paths)` must be greater than 4.

7. **Consider the expressions involving `pres` and `ress`**: These expressions depend on the loop body, but since we are only adjusting the loop head variables, we do not need to change `pres` or `ress` directly. However, we should note that `pres` will be updated based on `paths[4]` if the loop continues, and `ress` will be updated based on `curr` if the loop continues.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 4, `len(paths)` must be greater than 4**
