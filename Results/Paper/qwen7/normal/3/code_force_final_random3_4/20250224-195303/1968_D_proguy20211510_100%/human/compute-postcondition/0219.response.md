Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to `len(paths)`, meaning `i` is the length of the `paths` list.
- `k` is an integer less than `len(paths) + 1`.
- `curr` is calculated as `pres + paths[len(paths) - 1] * k`, where `pres` is the sum of all elements in `paths`.
- `ress` is the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`.
- `resb` is greater than or equal to `ress`.

The `print` statement simply outputs the string `'Draw'`.

Output: **'Draw'**
