Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is less than 4, `curr` is `pres` + `paths[3]` * (`k` - 3), `pres` is increased by `paths[3]`, `ress` is the maximum of `ress` and `curr`**.

Explanation: The line `ress = max(ress, curr)` updates `ress` to be the maximum value between its current value and `curr`. Since `curr` is defined as `pres + paths[3] * (k - 3)`, and `pres` is increased by `paths[3]`, these changes are reflected in the output state. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged, and the relationship between `curr` and the other variables is maintained.
