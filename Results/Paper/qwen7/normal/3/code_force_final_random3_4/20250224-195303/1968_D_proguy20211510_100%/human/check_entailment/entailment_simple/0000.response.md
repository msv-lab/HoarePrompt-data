Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the input parameters for each test case.
2. It initializes the necessary variables and constructs the paths for both Bodya and Sasha based on their starting positions.
3. The logic for calculating the scores for both players is implemented correctly using the formula \( \text{current score} = \text{previous score} + \text{score at current position} \times (\text{remaining turns}) \).
4. The program iterates through the paths and calculates the maximum possible scores for both players.
5. Finally, it compares the scores and prints the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').

Given the provided annotations and the logic in the program, the implementation seems to follow the problem statement accurately. There are no apparent errors in the logic or the flow of the program.

Correctness: **True**
