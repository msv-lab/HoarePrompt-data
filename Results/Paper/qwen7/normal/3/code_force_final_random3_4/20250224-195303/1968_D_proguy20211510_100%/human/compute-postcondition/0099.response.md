Output State: **`i` is 4, `k` is less than 5, `curr` is `pres` + `paths[4]` * (`k` - 4), `pres` is increased by `paths[4]`, `ress` is the maximum between `ress` and `curr`.**

Explanation: The code updates `pres` by adding `paths[4]` to it. It also calculates `curr` using the formula `pres` + `paths[4]` * (`k` - 4). Then, it updates `ress` to be the maximum value between its current value and `curr`. The values of `i` and `k` remain unchanged, and the updated values of `pres` and `curr` are used in the calculation of `ress`.
