Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a set of inputs including a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), test cases where for each case, it receives positive integers n, k, P_B, P_S (1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9), a permutation p of length n, and an array a of positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i). It returns different outputs based on the given inputs for each test case.**

- For each test case, the function processes the inputs n, k, P_B, P_S, the permutation p, and the array a.
- The function returns specific outputs based on the processed inputs for each test case.
