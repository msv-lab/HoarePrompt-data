Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for the "Permutation game." Specifically, the program does not account for the possibility of a player moving back and forth between positions, which could potentially maximize their score. Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

Consider the following input:
```
1
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```

- **Testcase Input:**
  - `n = 4`, `k = 2`, `P_B = 3`, `P_S = 2`
  - Permutation: `[4, 1, 2, 3]`
  - Array `a`: `[7, 2, 5, 6]`

- **Expected Outcome:**
  - Bodya starts at position 3 (value 3). His possible moves are:
    - Stay at 3: Score = 5 (since `a[3-1] = 5`).
    - Move to position 2 (value 1): Score = 5 (since `a[3-1] = 5`).
  - Sasha starts at position 2 (value 1). His possible moves are:
    - Stay at 2: Score = 2 (since `a[2-1] = 2`).
    - Move to position 4 (value 3): Score = 2 (since `a[2-1] = 2`).

- **Actual Output:**
  - The program calculates the scores as follows:
    - Bodya's score: `5 + 5 = 10` (staying at 3 for both turns).
    - Sasha's score: `2 + 2 = 4` (staying at 2 for both turns).

- **Issue:**
  - The program does not consider the optimal strategy for Sasha. Sasha can move from position 2 to position 4, and then back to position 2, achieving a higher score of `2 + 3 + 2 = 7`.

Therefore, the program does not handle all possible optimal strategies for the players, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.
