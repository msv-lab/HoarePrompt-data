Output State: **`vis` is a list of n zeros with the element at index `pb` - 1 set to 1, `i` is equal to the length of `paths`, `k` is equal to the length of `paths`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the loop iterations, `ress` holds the final maximum value between all `curr` values, `pathb` is a list containing the elements `a[pb - 1]` and `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, `n` is an integer from the first input string, `pb` is updated to the value of `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is an integer from the fourth input string, `p` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the first input string and converting each element to an integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers, `pb` is now the value of `p[pb - 1]`.**

In natural language: The value of `pb` is updated to the value of `p[pb - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
