Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is less than `i + 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; `resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `curr`, `preb` is `preb + pathb[0]`, `curr` is `preb + pathb[0] * (k - 0)**.

Explanation: The line `resb = max(resb, curr)` updates `resb` to be the maximum of its current value and `curr`. The value of `curr` is calculated as `preb + pathb[0] * (k - 0)`, which simplifies to `preb + pathb[0] * k`. Additionally, `preb` is updated to `preb + pathb[0]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
