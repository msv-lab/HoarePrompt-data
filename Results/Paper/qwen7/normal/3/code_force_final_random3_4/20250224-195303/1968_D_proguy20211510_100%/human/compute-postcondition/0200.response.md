Output State: **`pres` is increased by `paths[i]`, `i` is `len(paths) + 1`, `k` is an integer less than `len(paths) + 1`, `ress` is the maximum value between `ress` and `curr`, `curr` is equal to `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`, `ress` is updated to be the maximum of `ress` and `curr`.**

Explanation: The line `ress = max(ress, curr)` updates `ress` to be the maximum value between its current value and `curr`. The other variables (`pres`, `i`, `k`, and `curr`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
