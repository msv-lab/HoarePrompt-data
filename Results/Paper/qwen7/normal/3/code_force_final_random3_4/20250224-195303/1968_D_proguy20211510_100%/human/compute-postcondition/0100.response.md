Output State: **All variables are as follows: `i` is equal to the length of `paths`, `k` is equal to the length of `paths`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `resb` is the maximum value of `curr` calculated during the loop iterations, and `ress` holds the final maximum value between all `curr` values.**

In natural language, after the loop completes all its iterations:
- The variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `paths`.
- The variable `k` will also be equal to the length of the list `paths`.
- The variable `preb` will be the sum of all elements in the list `pathb`.
- The variable `resb` will hold the maximum value of `curr` that was calculated during the loop iterations.
- The variable `ress` will hold the final maximum value between all `curr` values calculated throughout the loop.
