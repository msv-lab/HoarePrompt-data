Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of test cases where each test case consists of three non-negative integers: the number of introverts (a), the number of extroverts (b), and the number of universals (c). The function returns the result based on the given constraints and relationships between these integers.**

Note: The actual processing logic and return values are not described here as per the instruction to only describe the parameters and return value without detailing the internal operations.
