Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `k` is 0.**

The code initializes `k` to 0, which does not affect the values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, or `c`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and only `k` is updated to 0.
