Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2 or 3, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user, `k` is either `a + (b + c) // 3` or `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1` depending on whether `(b + c) % 3` is not equal to 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are now integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers from the user input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial conditions for `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `k` remain valid, but now `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated to the values entered by the user.
