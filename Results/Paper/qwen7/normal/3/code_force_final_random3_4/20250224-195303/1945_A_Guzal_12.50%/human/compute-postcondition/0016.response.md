Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1 or 2, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The initial conditions for `n` and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, `n` must still be greater than 0, and `i` is either 1 or 2. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are the integers that the user inputs.
