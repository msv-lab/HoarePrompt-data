You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        k = 0
        if (b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0:
            print(-1)
        else:
            k += a + (b + c) // 3
            if (b + c) % 3 != 0:
                k += 1
            print(k)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three non-negative integers representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals. For each test case, it calculates a value based on specific conditions involving these integers and prints the result. If certain conditions are met, it adjusts the calculated value accordingly. The function ultimately outputs the cumulative sum of these adjusted values for all test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for calculating the number of tents is flawed. Let's consider the following test case:

- Input: `1 2 1` (1 introvert, 2 extroverts, 1 universal)

According to the problem description:
- The introvert needs 1 tent.
- The 2 extroverts need 1 tent together.
- The universal can share a tent with either the introvert or the extroverts.

The correct solution would be:
- 1 tent for the introvert.
- 1 tent for the 2 extroverts.
- 1 tent for the universal and the remaining extrovert.

So, the total number of tents required is 3.

However, the given program incorrectly calculates the number of tents. For the input `1 2 1`, the program prints `-1` because `(b + c) % 3 != 0` evaluates to `True`, which triggers the `-1` output.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly account for the different combinations of introverts, extroverts, and universals. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        k = 0
        
        # Tents for introverts
        k += a
        
        # Remaining people after allocating tents for introverts
        remaining_extroverts = b
        remaining_universals = c
        
        # Tents for extroverts
        if remaining_extroverts >= 2:
            k += remaining_extroverts // 3
            remaining_extroverts %= 3
        
        # Tents for universals
        if remaining_extroverts > 0:
            k += remaining_extroverts // 2
            remaining_universals -= remaining_extroverts // 2
        
        # Tents for remaining universals
        k += remaining_universals // 3
        
        print(k)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program handles all potential cases correctly.
