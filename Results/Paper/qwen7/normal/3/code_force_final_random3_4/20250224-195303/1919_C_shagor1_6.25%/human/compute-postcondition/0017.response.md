Postcondition: `a` and `x` are integers. If `a` is less than or equal to `x`, then `x` is set to `a`. If `a` is greater than `x`, then `x` is set to `y`, `y` is set to `a`, and `ans` is 1 if `a` is less than or equal to `y`. Otherwise, `y` is set to `a` and all other variables retain their values from the precondition.
