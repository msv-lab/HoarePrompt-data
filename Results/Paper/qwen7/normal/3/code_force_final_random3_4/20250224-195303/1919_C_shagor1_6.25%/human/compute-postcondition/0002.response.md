Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `inp` is a tuple containing integers from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `*inp, = map(int, input().split())` takes a line of input, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and assigns these integers to the elements of the tuple `inp`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The variable `n` is also not changed by this code.
