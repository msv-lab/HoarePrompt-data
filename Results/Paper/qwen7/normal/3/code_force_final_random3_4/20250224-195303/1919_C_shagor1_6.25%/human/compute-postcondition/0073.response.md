Postcondition: `ans` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the first element `a` of the non-empty list `inp` is less than or equal to `y`. After the if-else block executes, `n` is `n - 1`, `x` is `n`, and `y` is either `max(n, a)` or `a`. If `a <= x` (which is equivalent to `a <= y` since `x` is set to `a` in the if part), then `ans` is set to `a`. Otherwise, `ans` remains as either 0 or 1.
