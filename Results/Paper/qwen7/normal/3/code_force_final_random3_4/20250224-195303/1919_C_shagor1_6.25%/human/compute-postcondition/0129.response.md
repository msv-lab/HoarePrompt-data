Based on the initial state provided:

- After the loop executes all iterations, `x` will be the minimum value in the list `inp`.
- `y` will be the second minimum value in the list `inp`.
- `ans` will be the count of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.

The `print(ans)` statement will print the count of elements in the list `inp` that are greater than both the minimum value (`x`) and the second minimum value (`y`).

Output: **ans (where ans is the count of elements in the list inp that are greater than both the minimum value x and the second minimum value y)**
