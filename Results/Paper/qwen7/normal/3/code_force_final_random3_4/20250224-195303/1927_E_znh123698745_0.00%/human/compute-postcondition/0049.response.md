Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `array` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged, `answer` has an element appended which is `array[a[0]]`.**

Explanation: The code `answer.append(array[a[0]])` appends the element at index `a[0]` of the list `array` to the list `answer`. However, since the initial state does not provide specific values for `array` and `a`, these lists remain unchanged. The only change is that `answer` now contains one additional element, which is `array[a[0]]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain the same as they were in the initial state.
