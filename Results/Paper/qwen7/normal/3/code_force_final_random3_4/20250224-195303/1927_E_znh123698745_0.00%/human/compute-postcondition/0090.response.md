Output State: The `answer` list will contain `n` elements, starting with 1, followed by the elements at indices `a[-1]` and `a[0]` being adjusted according to the loop's conditions. Specifically, `a[-1]` will be decremented each time `(-1) ** i` is -1, and `a[0]` will be incremented each time it is not -1. Given the loop runs until `i` equals `n`, and considering the initial values and the conditions provided, `a[-1]` will eventually reach 0 and `a[0]` will reach `n-1`.

In more detail, the `answer` list will start with 1 (as given). For each iteration from 1 to `n-1`:
- If `(-1) ** i` is -1 (which happens when `i` is odd), `a[-1]` is decremented and the element at `array[a[-1]]` is appended to `answer`.
- If `(-1) ** i` is 1 (which happens when `i` is even), `a[0]` is incremented and the element at `array[a[0]]` is appended to `answer`.

After `n` iterations, `a[-1]` will be 0 (decremented from its initial value of 1 for every odd `i` up to `n-1`), and `a[0]` will be `n-1` (incremented from its initial value of 1 for every even `i` up to `n-2`). Therefore, the final `answer` list will be constructed as follows:
- The first element is 1.
- Subsequent elements come from `array[0]` for even `i` and `array[a[-1]]` (which becomes 0) for odd `i`.

So, the final `answer` list will be `[1, array[0], array[1], ..., array[n-2], array[0]]`.
