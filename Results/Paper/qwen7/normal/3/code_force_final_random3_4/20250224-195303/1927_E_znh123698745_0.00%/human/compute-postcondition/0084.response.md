Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `answer` is updated with the element at index `array[a[-1]]`**

Explanation: The code snippet `answer.append(array[a[-1]])` appends the element at the index specified by `a[-1]` from the list `array` to the list `answer`. However, the initial values and conditions of `i`, `n`, and `a` are not provided, so we only know that `i` remains 3 and `n` must be greater than 3. The `answer` list is updated with the new element.
