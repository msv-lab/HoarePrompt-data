Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `array` is unchanged, `a`[0] is 2, `answer` has an element appended which is `array[1]`**

Explanation: The code `a[0] += 1` increments the value of `a[0]` by 1. Given that `a[0]` was initially 1, it now becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
