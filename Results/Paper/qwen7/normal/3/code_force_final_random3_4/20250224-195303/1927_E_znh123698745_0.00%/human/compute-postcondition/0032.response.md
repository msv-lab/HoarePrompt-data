Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two inputs separated by a space and converts them to integers, assigning the first to `n` and the second to `k`. The values of `i` and the other variables (`a` and `array`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
