Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `array` is unchanged, `a[0]` is `a[0] + 1`, `answer` has the element `array[a[0]]` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code `a[0] += 1` increments the value of `a[0]` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` remains 3, `n` remains an input integer, `array` remains unchanged, and `a[0]` is now `a[0] + 1`. The `answer` list still has the element `array[a[0]]` appended to it.
