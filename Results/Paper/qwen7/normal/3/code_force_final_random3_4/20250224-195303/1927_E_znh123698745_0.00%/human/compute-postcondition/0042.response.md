Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `array` is a list containing numbers from 1 to n, `answer` is a list containing the numbers 1 and array[1], `a` is a list containing [1, -1]**.

Explanation: The code `answer.append(array[a[0]])` appends the element at index `a[0]` of the list `array` to the list `answer`. Since `a[0]` is 1 (because `a` is `[1, -1]`), `answer` will now contain the first element of `array`, which is 1 (since `array` contains numbers from 1 to n). Therefore, `answer` becomes a list containing the numbers 1 and array[1]. All other variables remain unchanged.
