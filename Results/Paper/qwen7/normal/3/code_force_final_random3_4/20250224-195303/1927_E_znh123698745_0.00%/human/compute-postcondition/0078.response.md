Output State: **`i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 1; `a[-1]` is one less than its original value; `answer` has an element appended from `array[a[-1]]`.**

Explanation: The code `a[-1] -= 1` decrements the last element of list `a` by 1. Since `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 1, these conditions remain unchanged. The `answer` list appends an element from `array[a[-1]]`, which means the element from `array` indexed by the new value of `a[-1]` is appended to `answer`.
