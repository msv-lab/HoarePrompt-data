Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `array` is unchanged, `a`[0] is 1, `answer` has an element appended which is `array[1]`**

Explanation: The code `answer.append(array[a[0]])` appends `array[a[0]]` to the list `answer`. Given the initial conditions, `a[0]` is incremented to 1, so `answer` now has an element appended which is `array[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
