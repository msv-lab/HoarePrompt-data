You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        array = list(range(1, n + 1))
        answer = [1]
        a = [1, -1]
        for i in range(1, n):
            if (-1) ** i == -1:
                answer.append(array[a[-1]])
                a[-1] -= 1
            else:
                answer.append(array[a[0]])
                a[0] += 1
        print(*answer)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each containing integers `n` and `k` (with `2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5` and `k` being even). For each test case, it constructs a list `answer` of length `n-1` by iterating through the range from 1 to `n-1`. During each iteration, it appends elements from a predefined list `array` (containing numbers from 1 to `n`) to `answer` based on specific conditions involving two indices `a[0]` and `a[-1]`. After processing all test cases, it prints the `answer` list for each case. The final state of the program is that it has printed the constructed `answer` lists for all given test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly constructs a k-level permutation of length n for the given problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The program initializes an array `array` with values from 1 to n.
   - It starts constructing the answer array `answer` with the value 1.
   - It uses a list `a` initialized as `[1, -1]` to keep track of indices for selecting elements from the `array`.

3. **Building the Permutation**:
   - The loop runs from 1 to `n-1` to fill the rest of the `answer` array.
   - Inside the loop:
     - If `(-1) ** i` is `-1`, it appends `array[a[-1]]` to `answer` and decrements `a[-1]`.
     - Otherwise, it appends `array[a[0]]` to `answer` and increments `a[0]`.

### Verification

To verify the correctness, let's consider the logic and constraints:

1. **k-Level Permutation Definition**:
   - A permutation is k-level if the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any continuous segment of length k is at most 1.

2. **Pattern in the Given Program**:
   - The program alternates between selecting elements from the start and end of the `array`. This pattern ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length k will be close to each other because the differences between consecutive elements in the `array` are small (just 1).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles even `k` correctly by alternating between the start and end indices.
   - The initial value of 1 in the `answer` array ensures that the first sum is 1, and the subsequent sums follow a pattern that maintains the k-level property.

### Testing with Examples

Let's test the program with the provided examples:

- **Test Case 1**: `n = 2`, `k = 2`
  - `array = [1, 2]`
  - `answer = [1, 2]`
  - Sums: `1 + 2 = 3`

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 3`, `k = 2`
  - `array = [1, 2, 3]`
  - `answer = [1, 2, 3]`
  - Sums: `1 + 2 = 3`, `2 + 3 = 5`

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 10`, `k = 4`
  - `array = [1, 2, 3, ..., 10]`
  - `answer = [1, 8, 4, 10, 2, 7, 5, 9, 3, 6]`
  - Sums: `1 + 8 + 4 + 10 = 23`, `8 + 4 + 10 + 2 = 24`, etc.

### Conclusion

The program correctly constructs a k-level permutation by alternating between the start and end of the array, ensuring that the sums of continuous segments of length k are close to each other.
