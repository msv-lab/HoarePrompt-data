Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `array` is a list containing numbers from 1 to n, `answer` is a list containing the numbers 1 and array[1], `a` is a list containing [2, -1]**.

Explanation: The code `a[0] += 1` increments the first element of list `a` by 1. Initially, `a` was `[1, -1]`. After executing the code, the first element of `a` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
