Output State: **`array` is a list containing numbers from 1 to `n`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `i` is now equal to `n`, the variable `k` remains unchanged, the `answer` list contains elements appended based on the conditions inside the loop.**

Explanation: The code `array = list(range(1, n + 1))` creates a list called `array` containing numbers from 1 to `n`. This list replaces the existing `array` which was a list containing numbers from 1 to `n`. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `i`, and the `answer` list) remain unchanged as per the initial state.
