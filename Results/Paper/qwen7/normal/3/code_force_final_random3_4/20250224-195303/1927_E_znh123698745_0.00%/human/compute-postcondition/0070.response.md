Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `answer` contains the element at index `array[a[-1]-1]`**

Explanation: The code `a[-1] -= 1` decrements the last element of the list `a` by 1. Since `a[-1]` was previously referring to the last element of `a`, after the decrement, `a[-1]` now refers to the new value of the last element. The variable `answer` still contains the element at the index `array[a[-1]]`, but since `a[-1]` has been decremented by 1, it now refers to the element at index `array[a[-1]-1]`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
