Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `(-1)^i` is equal to 1; `a[0]` is increased by 1; `answer` now contains the element `array[a[0]]` from the original list.**

Explanation: The value of `i` remains 1, `n` remains greater than or equal to 1, `(-1)^i` remains equal to 1 since `i` is 1, and `a[0]` is incremented by 1. The value of `answer` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code snippet.
