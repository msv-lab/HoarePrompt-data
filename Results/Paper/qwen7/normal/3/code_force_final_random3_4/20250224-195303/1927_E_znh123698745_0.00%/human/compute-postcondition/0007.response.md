Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `answer` contains the element at index `array[a[-1]]`.**

Explanation: The code `answer.append(array[a[-1]])` appends the element at the index specified by `a[-1]` from the list `array` to the list `answer`. However, the exact value of `answer` and `array` is not provided, and neither is the value of `a`. Therefore, we can only state that `answer` now contains the element at the index `a[-1]` from `array`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
