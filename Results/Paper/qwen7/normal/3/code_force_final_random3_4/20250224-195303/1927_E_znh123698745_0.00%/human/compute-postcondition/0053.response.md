Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is an input integer (unchanged)
   - `array` is unchanged
   - Postcondition: If `i` is 2 and `(-1) ** i` equals -1, then `a`[-1] is decreased by 1 and an element is appended to `answer` from `array[a[-1]]`. Otherwise, `a` is set to [1] and an element is appended to `answer` which is `array[1]`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.

4. **Next Value of `i`:**
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 3.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be 3.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged.
   - The `array` remains unchanged.
   - The postcondition needs to be checked for the new value of `i`.

6. **Postcondition Check for New `i`:**
   - For `i = 3`, `(-1) ** i` equals 1 (since `(-1) ** 3` is -1, but the condition checks if it equals 1).
   - Therefore, the postcondition does not apply directly, and the logic inside the loop body for `i = 3` would be different from the previous iteration.

7. **Final State Adjustment:**
   - The only variable that changes is `i`, which becomes 3.
   - `n` and `array` remain unchanged.
   - The postcondition for `i = 3` is not explicitly given, but we know the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `array` is unchanged**
