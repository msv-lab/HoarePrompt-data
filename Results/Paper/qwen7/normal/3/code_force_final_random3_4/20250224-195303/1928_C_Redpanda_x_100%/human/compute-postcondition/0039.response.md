Output State: **`prime_to_i` is now `prime_to_i * prime * prime`, `rest` is the list without its first two elements, `factor` is the second element of the modified `rest` list, `factors[prime]` must be at least 1, and `factor * prime_to_i` is yielded.**

Explanation: The code multiplies `prime_to_i` by `prime`, updating its value to `prime_to_i * prime * prime`. The other variables (`rest`, `factor`, `factors[prime]`, and the yielded value) remain unchanged from their previous states.
