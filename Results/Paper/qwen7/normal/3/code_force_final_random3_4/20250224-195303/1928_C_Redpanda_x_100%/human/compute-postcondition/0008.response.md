Output State: **`factors[prime]` is a non-negative integer; `factor * prime_to_i` is generated and yielded.**

Explanation: The code `yield factor * prime_to_i` generates and yields the value of `factor * prime_to_i`. However, the actual value of `factor * prime_to_i` is not specified in the initial state, so we only know that it is generated and yielded. The value of `factors[prime]` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it directly.
