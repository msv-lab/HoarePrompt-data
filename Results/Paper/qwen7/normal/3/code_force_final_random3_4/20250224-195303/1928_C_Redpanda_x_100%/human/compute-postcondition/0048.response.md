Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter k. It generates a sequence based on the value of k where each test case consists of two integers n and x such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9 and 1 <= k <= 100. The function returns a value based on the sequence generated.**

Note: The specific value returned from the sequence generation is not detailed in the provided information, so the functionality focuses on the process described.
