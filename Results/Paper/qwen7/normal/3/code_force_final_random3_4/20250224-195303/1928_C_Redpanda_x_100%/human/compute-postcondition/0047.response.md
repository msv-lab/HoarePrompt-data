Postcondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, each test case consists of two integers n and x such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9. If k (the length of the list primes) is equal to the length of the list primes, then 1 is yielded. Otherwise, the rest list is empty, prime_to_i holds the product of prime raised to the power of the sum of factors[prime] over all iterations plus one, factor is None because there are no more elements in rest, factors[prime] is set to 0, and the loop has yielded several values of factor * prime_to_i during its execution.**
