Based on the initial state provided:

- `b` is a list.
- `n` is at least 2.
- Every even-indexed element of `b` up to `n-2` is not equal to '>'.
- `no_path` remains False.

The print statement is simply:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string 'YES' regardless of the values of `b`, `n`, and `no_path`.

Output: **YES**
