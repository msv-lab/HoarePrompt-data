Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `b` is a list (though the contents of the list are not specified).
   - `k` is explicitly set to 5.
   - There is a conditional check involving `a[5]`, but since `a` is not defined, it's unclear what `a[5]` refers to. However, the problem states that if `a[5]` is not equal to '>', then `no_path` is False. This part is irrelevant to the `print(k)` statement.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   - The code snippet contains only one line: `print(k)`.

3. **Determination of Output**:
   - Since `k` is explicitly set to 5, the `print(k)` statement will simply print the value of `k`.

Output: **5**
