Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string from the user, `b` is the input string from the user, and the second last character of `b` is not '>'**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The other variables (`i`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged, including the condition about the second last character of `b` not being '>'.
