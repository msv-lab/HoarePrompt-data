Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `k` is 0
   - `n` must be at least 2
   - If `b[k]` is not '>', then `no_path` is False. If `b[k]` is '>', then no change occurs to the variables.

2. **Loop Head**: The loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for k in range(0, n, 2):
       # the loop body is omit
   ```

3. **Loop Iteration**: The loop iterates over `k` starting from 0 up to `n-1` in steps of 2. Given that `k` was 0 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `k` would be 2 (since the step size is 2).

4. **Conditions for Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue if `k < n`.
   - Since `k` is incremented by 2 each time, the next value of `k` is 2.
   - For the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than `n`.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - `k` will be set to 2.
   - `n` must still be at least 2.
   - The condition for `no_path` remains the same based on the value of `b[2]`.

Given this analysis, the updated state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`k` is 2, `n` must be at least 2**
