Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 2, `no_path` is `False`**

Explanation: The code simply assigns `False` to the variable `no_path`. Since `no_path` was previously set to `False` based on the condition involving `b[2]`, this assignment does not change its value. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
