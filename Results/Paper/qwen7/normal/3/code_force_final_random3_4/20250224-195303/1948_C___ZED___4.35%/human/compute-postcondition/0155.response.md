Postcondition: `k` is `n-2`, `no_path` remains `True`, and `n` retains its original value. If during any iteration, `b[k]` is not '>', `no_path` will be set to `False`. Therefore, `no_path` will be `False` if any element in the range `[0, n-3]` of `b` is not '>', and `True` otherwise. `i` will still be 2, `n` will retain its original value, and both `a` and `b` will remain as the strings input by the user.
