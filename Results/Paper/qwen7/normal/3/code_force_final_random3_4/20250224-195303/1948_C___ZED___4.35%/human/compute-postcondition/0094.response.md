Output State: **`k` is `n-2`, `n` must be at least 3, and `no_path` is `False`**.

Explanation: The line `no_path = False` sets the variable `no_path` to `False`. The values of `k` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state includes these unchanged values along with the updated value of `no_path`.
