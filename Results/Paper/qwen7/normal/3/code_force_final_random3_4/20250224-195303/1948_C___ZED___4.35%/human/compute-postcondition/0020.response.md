Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `k`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `k` is less than `n` and `k` is incremented by 2 each time.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `b` is a list.
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - The `(k_end + 2)`-th element of `b` is not equal to `'>'.
   - `no_path` remains `False`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `k` by 2, the next value of `k` would be `k_end + 2`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `k_end + 2` must be less than `n`.

5. **Update the State**:
   - `k` will be updated to `k_end + 2`.
   - The condition `n` must be at least 2 still holds.
   - The condition that the `(k_end + 2)`-th element of `b` is not equal to `'>`' still holds.
   - `no_path` remains `False`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: `b` is a list, `n` must be at least 2, and the `(k_end + 2)`-th element of `b` is not equal to `'>`, and `no_path` remains `False`.**
