Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes two strings of length n, where each character in the strings is either '<' or '>'. The function returns a value based on the relationship between these two strings, considering the constraints that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 with n being even.**
