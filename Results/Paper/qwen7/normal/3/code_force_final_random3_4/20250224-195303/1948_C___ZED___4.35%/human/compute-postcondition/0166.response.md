Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` retains its original value, `a` and `b` remain as the strings input by the user. If `b[-2] != '>', then `i` remains 2 and `n` retains its original value. If `n` equals 1, `i` remains 2 and `n` retains its original value. Otherwise, `k` is set to `n-2`, `no_path` is `False`, and `n` retains its original value.
