Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, the number of columns.
   - It then reads two strings `a` and `b` representing the first and second rows of the grid respectively.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - If `b[-2]` (the second last character of the second row) is not `'>`', the program prints 'NO'. This check is incomplete because it only considers the second last column and does not account for the entire path.
   - If `n == 1`, the program prints 'YES'. This is incorrect because the problem specifies that `n` is at least 2.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The program sets `no_path` to `True` initially.
   - It iterates through every second column in the second row (`b`). If any of these columns have a `<` (left arrow), it sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - After this loop, if `no_path` is still `True`, it means there is a continuous path of `>` (right arrows) from the start to the end of the second row.
   - Next, it checks the first row (`a`) in a similar manner but only for odd-indexed columns. If any of these columns have a `<` (left arrow), it sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - Finally, if `no_path` is still `True`, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Issues with the Program

1. **Incomplete Check for Second Row:**
   - The check `if b[-2] != '>'` is insufficient. It only checks the second last column and does not ensure the robot can reach the last column.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Single Column Case:**
   - The condition `if n == 1` should not return 'YES' because the robot cannot move from `(1, 1)` to `(2, 1)` in a single column grid.

3. **Incorrect Path Checking:**
   - The logic for checking paths in the first and second rows is flawed. It does not correctly simulate the robot's movement considering both rows simultaneously.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the robot's movement through both rows and ensure it can reach `(2, n)`.

### Corrected Program

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        
        # Check if the last column can be reached
        if b[-1] == '<':
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        # Simulate the robot's movement
        row = 1
        col = 1
        while col < n:
            if row == 1:
                if a[col] == '<':
                    row = 2
                else:
                    col += 1
            else:
                if b[col] == '<':
                    row = 1
                else:
                    col += 1
        
        if col == n and row == 2:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

### Conclusion

The original program has several logical flaws and does not correctly simulate the robot's movement. The corrected program ensures the robot's movement is properly simulated and checks if it can reach the target cell `(2, n)`.

**Correctness: **False**
