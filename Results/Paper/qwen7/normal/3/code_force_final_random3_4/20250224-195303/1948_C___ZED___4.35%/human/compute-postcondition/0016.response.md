Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `k` and the range `range(0, n, 2)`. Therefore, the variables involved are `k` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `k` is less than `n` and `k` is incremented by 2 each iteration.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `b` is a list.
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - The `k`-th element of `b` is not equal to `'>'.
   - `no_path` is `False`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `k` is incremented by 2 each iteration, if `k` was `k_end` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `k` will be `k_end + 2`.
   - The condition `n` must be at least 2 remains unchanged unless specified otherwise.
   - The postcondition about the `k`-th element of `b` not being `'>`' still holds.
   - The state of `no_path` remains `False`.

5. **Calculate the New Value of `k`**:
   - Let's assume `k_end` (the value of `k` at the end of the previous iteration) was `k_end`.
   - At the start of the next iteration, `k` will be `k_end + 2`.

6. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `b` remains a list.
   - `n` must still be at least 2.
   - The `(k_end + 2)`-th element of `b` is not equal to `'>`.
   - `no_path` remains `False`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`b` is a list, `n` must be at least 2, and the (k_end + 2)-th element of `b` is not equal to '>', and `no_path` is False**.
