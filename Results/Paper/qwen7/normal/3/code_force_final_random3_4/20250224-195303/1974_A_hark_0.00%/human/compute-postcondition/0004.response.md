Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0**

Explanation: The function `func_2()` is called, but since no changes to variables are made within the function call itself (no assignments or operations that affect `t` are shown), the value of `t` remains unchanged. Therefore, the only information about `t` that remains valid is that it is an integer greater than 0.
