State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, _ is not relevant as it is a placeholder**.

Explanation:
- The variable `_` is a placeholder used in Python for loop indices when the index itself is not needed. It does not hold any state that needs adjustment for the loop to execute.
- The variable `t` is an input integer that determines how many times the loop will run. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a valid integer within the specified range (1 to \(10^4\)).

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
