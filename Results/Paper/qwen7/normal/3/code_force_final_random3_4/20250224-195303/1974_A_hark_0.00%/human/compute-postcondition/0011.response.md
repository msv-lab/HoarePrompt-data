Given the initial state where `x` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, and `y` is 0, we need to determine the output of the expression `math.ceil(x / 15)`.

1. Since `x` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, it means `x` can be any positive integer (e.g., 1, 2, 3, ...).
2. The expression inside the `math.ceil` function is `x / 15`. This will give us a floating-point number.
3. The `math.ceil` function rounds this floating-point number up to the nearest integer.

For example:
- If `x = 1`, then `x / 15` is approximately `0.0667`, and `math.ceil(0.0667)` is `1`.
- If `x = 15`, then `x / 15` is `1`, and `math.ceil(1)` is `1`.
- If `x = 16`, then `x / 15` is approximately `1.0667`, and `math.ceil(1.0667)` is `2`.

Since `x` can be any positive integer, the result of `math.ceil(x / 15)` will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `x / 15`.

Therefore, the output will be the ceiling value of `x / 15`.

Output: **math.ceil(x / 15) (where x is a non-negative integer greater than 0)**
