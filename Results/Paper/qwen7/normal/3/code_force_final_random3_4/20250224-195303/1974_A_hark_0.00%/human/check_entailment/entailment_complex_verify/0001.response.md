### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the logic in `func_2` is flawed and provides a detailed explanation of why it is incorrect. The key issues are:

1. The calculation `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect because it incorrectly assumes that each 2x2 icon takes up 15 cells instead of 4 cells.
2. The calculation `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1` is also incorrect because it does not account for the placement of 1x1 icons correctly.

The original assessment suggests a corrected approach, which involves:
1. Calculating the number of 2x2 icons that can fit into the grid.
2. Subtracting the space taken by these 2x2 icons from the total grid space.
3. Calculating how many 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining space.
4. Summing up the number of screens needed for both types of icons.

Given the provided annotated code and the detailed analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program needs to be revised to correctly calculate the number of screens required.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in calculating the number of screens needed, as identified and explained in the original assessment.
