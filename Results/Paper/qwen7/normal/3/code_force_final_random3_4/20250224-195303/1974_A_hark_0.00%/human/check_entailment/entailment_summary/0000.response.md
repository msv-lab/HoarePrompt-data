Reasoning:
- The program is designed to process multiple test cases where each test case involves determining the minimum number of screens needed to place a given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons on a grid.
- The main function `func_3()` reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by calling `func_2()`.
- `func_2()` correctly handles different scenarios based on the presence of 1x1 and 2x2 icons and calculates the minimum number of screens required.
- The logic in `func_2()` is sound:
  - If both `x` and `y` are positive, it adjusts `x` and calculates the total number of rows needed.
  - If only `y` is positive, it directly calculates the number of rows needed for 2x2 icons.
  - If only `x` is positive, it calculates the number of rows needed for 1x1 icons.
  - If neither `x` nor `y` is positive, it prints 0, indicating no icons to place.
- Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the implementation appears to correctly solve the problem for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
