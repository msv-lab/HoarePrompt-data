Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

# Annotated Functions:
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_3()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.
def func_1(a, b):
    return a if a < b else b
    #The program returns the value of 'b' if 'a' is greater than or equal to 'b', otherwise it returns the value of 'a'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b`. It compares these values and returns `b` if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, otherwise it returns `a`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers representing the number of applications with 1 × 1 and 2 × 2 icons, respectively.
def func_2():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if (x > 0 and y > 0) :
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
        #This is printed: bxsfory1 + bxsfory (where bxsfory1 = math.ceil(x / 15) + 1 and bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2))
    else :
        if (x == 0 and y > 0) :
            print(math.ceil(y / 2))
            #This is printed: math.ceil(y / 2) (where y is a non-negative integer greater than 0)
        else :
            if (x > 0 and y == 0) :
                print(math.ceil(x / 15))
                #This is printed: math.ceil(x / 15) (where x is a non-negative integer greater than 0)
            else :
                print(0)
                #This is printed: 0
            #State: x and y are non-negative integers, where y is 0 and x is either greater than 0 or not greater than 0 (i.e., 0).
        #State: x and y are non-negative integers, where if x is 0, y is a non-negative integer greater than 0, and a is a list of integers. If x is not 0, then y is 0.
    #State: `x` and `y` are non-negative integers. If `x` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `bxsfory * 15` and `y` is greater than 0, then `x` is adjusted according to specific rules (either set to twice the value of `x` or incremented by 5 based on the value of `x`). If `x` is 0, then `y` is a non-negative integer greater than 0. If `x` is not 0, then `y` is set to 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes the number of 1 × 1 and 2 × 2 application icons (represented by `x` and `y` respectively) and calculates the total number of rows needed to arrange these icons. It prints the result based on the given conditions. If both `x` and `y` are positive, it adjusts `x` according to specific rules and calculates the total rows. If only `y` is positive, it calculates the rows based on `y`. If only `x` is positive, it calculates the rows based on `x`. If neither `x` nor `y` is positive, it prints 0.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.
def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_2()
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer greater than 0.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the input integer. Since the loop decreases the value of `t` by 1 with each iteration (implied by the problem's progression), after all iterations, `t` will be less than or equal to 0. However, since `t` starts as a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), and the loop continues as long as `t` is greater than 0, the final value of `t` after all iterations will still satisfy the condition of being an integer greater than 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases defined by an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, it calls another function `func_2()`, which processes two integers `x` and `y` (where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99). After processing all test cases, the function ensures that the variable `t` is an integer greater than 0.
