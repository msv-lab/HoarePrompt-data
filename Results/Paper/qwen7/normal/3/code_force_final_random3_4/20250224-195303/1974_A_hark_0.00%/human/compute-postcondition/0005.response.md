Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `t` in the expression `range(t)`. This means the loop will run `t` times.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` was an integer greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the State**: Since `t` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to ensure that `t` remains greater than 0 for the loop to continue. After each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1 (assuming the loop body does not change the value of `t`).

4. **Calculate the New Value of `t`**: If `t` was greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be decremented by 1 for the next iteration. Therefore, `t` will now be an integer greater than or equal to 0 but not greater than it was previously.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `t` is still an integer greater than 0 but has been decremented by 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0** (but has been decremented by 1 from its previous value).
