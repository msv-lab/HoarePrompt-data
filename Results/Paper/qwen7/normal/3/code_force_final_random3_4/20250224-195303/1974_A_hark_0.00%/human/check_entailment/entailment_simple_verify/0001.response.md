### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the logic in `func_2` is flawed. Let's break down the issues and verify the corrected approach.

#### Issues in the Original Logic:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Space Taken by 2x2 Icons:**
   - The original code incorrectly calculates the space taken by 2x2 icons using `bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`. Each 2x2 icon actually takes up 4 cells, not 15 cells.
   - The correct way to calculate the number of 2x2 icons that can fit into the grid is to use `math.ceil((5 * 3 * y) / (2 * 2))`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Remaining Space:**
   - After placing the 2x2 icons, the remaining space should be calculated correctly. The original code incorrectly subtracts `bxsfory * 15` from `x`, which is not the correct way to account for the space taken by 2x2 icons.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of 1x1 Icons in Remaining Space:**
   - The original code incorrectly calculates the number of 1x1 icons that can fit into the remaining space using `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`. The correct way is to use the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons and divide by 15.

#### Corrected Approach:

1. **Calculate the Number of 2x2 Icons That Can Fit:**
   - Use `math.ceil((5 * 3 * y) / (2 * 2))` to calculate the number of 2x2 icons that can fit into the grid.

2. **Calculate the Remaining Space After Placing 2x2 Icons:**
   - Subtract the space taken by the 2x2 icons from the total grid space.

3. **Calculate the Number of 1x1 Icons That Can Fit in the Remaining Space:**
   - Use the remaining space to calculate the number of 1x1 icons that can fit.

4. **Sum Up the Number of Screens Needed:**
   - Sum the number of screens needed for both 2x2 and 1x1 icons.

The corrected logic ensures that the calculations are done accurately, leading to the correct number of screens needed.

### Final Evaluation:

Based on the detailed analysis and the corrected approach, the original program is indeed incorrect due to the flawed logic in calculating the number of screens needed. The corrected approach provided above ensures the program works correctly.

**Final: False**

The original assessment was accurate in identifying the flaws in the logic.
