You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers representing the number of applications with 1 × 1 and 2 × 2 icons, respectively.
def func_2():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if (x > 0 and y > 0) :
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
        #This is printed: bxsfory1 + bxsfory (where bxsfory1 = math.ceil(x / 15) + 1 and bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2))
    else :
        if (x == 0 and y > 0) :
            print(math.ceil(y / 2))
            #This is printed: math.ceil(y / 2) (where y is a non-negative integer greater than 0)
        else :
            if (x > 0 and y == 0) :
                print(math.ceil(x / 15))
                #This is printed: math.ceil(x / 15) (where x is a non-negative integer greater than 0)
            else :
                print(0)
                #This is printed: 0
            #State: x and y are non-negative integers, where y is 0 and x is either greater than 0 or not greater than 0 (i.e., 0).
        #State: x and y are non-negative integers, where if x is 0, y is a non-negative integer greater than 0, and a is a list of integers. If x is not 0, then y is 0.
    #State: `x` and `y` are non-negative integers. If `x` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `bxsfory * 15` and `y` is greater than 0, then `x` is adjusted according to specific rules (either set to twice the value of `x` or incremented by 5 based on the value of `x`). If `x` is 0, then `y` is a non-negative integer greater than 0. If `x` is not 0, then `y` is set to 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns the total number of applications arranged using 1 × 1 and 2 × 2 icons, where x represents the number of 1 × 1 icons and y represents the number of 2 × 2 icons.

Return Postconditions: 

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
