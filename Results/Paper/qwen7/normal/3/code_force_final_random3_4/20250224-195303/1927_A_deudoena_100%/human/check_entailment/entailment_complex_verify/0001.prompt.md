You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program: 
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c

- Annotated Code: 
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10 and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where at least one character in s is 'B'.
def func_1():
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
        
    #State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows: `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one character being 'B'; `j` is the last character in the string `s`; `c` is equal to `n`; `mi` is the index (1-based) of the first 'B' in the string `s`, or 0 if there is no 'B' in the string. The variable `d` is 0, `l` is an empty list, and the other variables (`ma`, `t`, `n`, `m`) retain their initial values.
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
        
    #State: Postcondition: `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one character being 'B'; `j` is the last character in the original string `s`; `c` is `n`; `mi` is the index (1-based) of the first 'B' in the string `s`, or 0 if there is no 'B' in the string `s`; `d` is `n`; `l` is an empty list; `ma` is `0`.
    return ma - mi + 2
    #The program returns a value which is the result of subtracting the index of the first 'B' (or 0 if no 'B' exists) from 'ma' (which is 0), and then adding 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a binary string `s` of length `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10) consisting of characters 'W' and 'B'. It calculates and returns a value based on the positions of the first and last 'B' characters in the string. Specifically, it returns the difference between the position of the last 'B' and the first 'B', plus 2. If no 'B' is found, it returns 2.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum length of a continuous segment of cells that, when painted white, will turn all black cells in the segment to white.
   - The solution should work for multiple test cases, each with a different strip configuration.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()` but does not pass any parameters to it, which is incorrect.
   - `func_1()` is supposed to calculate the minimum length of the segment to paint white.

3. **Issues in `func_1()`:**
   - The function `func_1()` does not correctly identify the minimum segment length.
   - It calculates `mi` as the position of the first black cell and `ma` as the position of the last black cell from the end.
   - The formula `ma - mi + 2` is incorrect because it does not account for the correct segment length needed to cover all black cells.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To find the minimum segment length, we need to find the distance between the first and last black cells and add 1 to cover both ends.
   - If there are no black cells, the entire strip is already white, so the length is 0.

5. **Correct Implementation:**
   - We should iterate through the string to find the first and last positions of 'B'.
   - Calculate the distance between these positions and add 1.

### Corrected Code:

```python
def func_1():
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    # Find the first and last positions of 'B'
    first_black = s.find('B')
    last_black = s.rfind('B')
    
    # If no black cells, return 0
    if first_black == -1:
        return 0
    
    # Calculate the minimum segment length
    min_length = last_black - first_black + 1
    return min_length

n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())
```

### Conclusion:
The original code is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum segment length. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
