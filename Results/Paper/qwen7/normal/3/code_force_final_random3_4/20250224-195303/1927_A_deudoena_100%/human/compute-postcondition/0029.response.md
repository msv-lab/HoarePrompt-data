Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one character being 'B'; `j` is the last character in the original string `s` and it is 'B'; `c` is `n`; `mi` is the index (1-based) of the first 'B' in the string `s`, or 0 if there is no 'B' in the string; `d` is 1; `l` is an empty list; `ma` is `n - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `ma = len(s) - d` calculates the length of the string `s` and subtracts the value of `d` from it. Since `d` is 1, `ma` is set to `n - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
