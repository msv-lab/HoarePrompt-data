Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one character being 'B'; `j` is the last character in the original string `s` and it is 'B'; `c` is `n`; `mi` is the index (1-based) of the first 'B' in the string `s`, or 0 if there is no 'B' in the string; `d` is 1; `l` is an empty list; `ma` is `n - 1`; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but indicates that the execution exits the innermost loop or conditional block it was in. All other variables retain their initial states.
