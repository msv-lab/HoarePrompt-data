Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white so that all cells become white. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Initialization**: The variables `ma` and `mi` are initialized to 0, but they should be used to track the positions of the first and last black cells respectively.

2. **Logic for Finding `mi` and `ma`**: The logic for finding the first black cell (`mi`) and the last black cell (`ma`) is flawed. Specifically, the code breaks out of the loop after finding the first black cell and calculates the position incorrectly.

3. **Return Value Calculation**: The formula `ma - mi + 2` is incorrect. The correct calculation should be `ma - mi + 1`, and it should account for the case where the entire strip is already white.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1():
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = 0
    mi = float('inf')
    ma = -1
    for j in range(m):
        if s[j] == 'B':
            mi = min(mi, j)
            ma = max(ma, j)
    # If the entire strip is already white, return 0
    if ma == -1:
        return 0
    else:
        return ma - mi + 1
```

This corrected function properly identifies the positions of the first and last black cells and calculates the minimum segment length correctly.
