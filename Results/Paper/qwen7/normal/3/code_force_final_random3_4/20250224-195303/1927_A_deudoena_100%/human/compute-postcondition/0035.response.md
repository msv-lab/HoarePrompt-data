Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one character being 'B'; `j` is the second-to-last character in the original string `s`; `c` is `n`; `mi` is the index (1-based) of the first 'B' in the string `s`, or 0 if there is no 'B' in the string `s`; `d` is 2; `l` is an empty list; `ma` is `n - 2`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ma` to be `len(s) - d`. Given that `len(s)` is `n` and `d` is 2, `ma` is now `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
