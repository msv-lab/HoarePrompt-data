Output State: **`ma` is 0, `mi` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where at least one character in `s` is 'B', `m` is an input integer, `c` is 0, `d` is 0, `l` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `l`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
