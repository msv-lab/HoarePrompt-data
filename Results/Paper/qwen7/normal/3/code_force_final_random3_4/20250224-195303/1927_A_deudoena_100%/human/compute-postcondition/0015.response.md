Output State: **`mi` is 2, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one character being 'B'; `j` is the second character in the string `s`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `mi`, `s`, and `j`. It only indicates that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. The initial conditions for `s` and `j` remain unchanged.
