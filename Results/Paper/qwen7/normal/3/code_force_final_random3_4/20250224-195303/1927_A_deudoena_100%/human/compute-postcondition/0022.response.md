Output State: **`mi` is 3, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one character being 'B'; `j` is the third character in the string `s`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `mi`, `s`, or `j`. It only indicates that we exit the innermost loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.
