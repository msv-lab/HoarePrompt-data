Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `j` which is iterating over each character in the string `s`.

2. **Understand the Initial States**:
   - `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one character being 'B'.
   - `j` is the first character in the string `s`.
   - `c` is 1.
   - If `j` is 'B', then `mi` is 1 and the loop breaks.

3. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `j` is the first character in the string `s` at the start of the loop, after the first iteration, `j` will be the second character in the string `s`.
   - The value of `c` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.
   - The condition for breaking out of the loop (if `j` is 'B') still holds true for the subsequent characters in the string.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` will now be the second character in the string `s`.
   - `c` remains 1.
   - The condition for `mi` being 1 and breaking out of the loop still needs to be considered, but since we are only adjusting the states at the start of the next iteration, we don't change `mi` unless `j` is 'B'.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one character being 'B'; `j` is the second character in the string `s`; `c` is 1**.
