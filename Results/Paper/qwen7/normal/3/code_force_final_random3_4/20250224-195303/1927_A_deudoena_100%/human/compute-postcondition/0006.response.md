Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one character being 'B', `j` is the first character in the string `s`, `c` is 1.**

Explanation: The variable `c` is incremented by 1, starting from an unspecified initial value (which is not given). Since the problem does not specify the initial value of `c`, we assume it starts at 0. After executing `c += 1`, `c` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
