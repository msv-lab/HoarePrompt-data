Output State: **`tmp` must contain at least two elements, `i` is the second element of `tmp`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `tmp`, `i`, `y`, or `ans`. It only causes the loop or conditional block it is within to terminate. Since no new assignments are made, the values of `tmp` and `i` remain unchanged, and we simply note that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
