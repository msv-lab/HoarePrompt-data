Postcondition: `tmp` must contain at least one element, `i` is either the first element of `tmp` or no longer the first element of `tmp`. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, `ans` is the sum of the first element of `tmp` plus whatever was previously in `ans`, and `y` is decreased by `i - 1`. If `y` is less than `i - 1`, `i` remains the first element of `tmp`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
