Output State: **`i` is the smallest remaining value in `tmp`, `ans` is the sum of all elements in `tmp` that were successfully subtracted from `y` without making `y` negative, `tmp` is an empty list, `y` is the remaining value after all valid subtractions from `tmp` have been made, `ii` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `tt` is the same as before.**

Explanation: The code `n, x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. The initial values of `i`, `ans`, `tmp`, `y`, `ii`, and `tt` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes these updated variables along with their new values.
