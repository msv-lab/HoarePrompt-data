Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `a`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `len(a) - 1` (inclusive). This means `i` starts at `1` and increments by `1` until it reaches `len(a) - 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `a` is a list with at least 2 elements.
   - `i` is `1`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `i` is currently `1`, the next value of `i` will be `2`.
   - We need to check if `a` still has at least 2 elements for the loop to continue.

Given these points, let's adjust the states for the next iteration of the loop:

- `i` will be incremented to `2`.
- `a` must still have at least 2 elements for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2**
