Postcondition: `i` is the second element of `tmp`, `tmp` is a sorted list with at least two elements, and `ans` is the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `y` is decreased by `i - 1` and `ans` is updated to be the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus the second element of `tmp`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.
