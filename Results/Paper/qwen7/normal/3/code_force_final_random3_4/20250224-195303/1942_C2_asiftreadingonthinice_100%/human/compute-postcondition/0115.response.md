Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(a)`, `len(a)` must be greater than 0, `tmp` is a sorted list that must have at least one element, and `ans` is `ans + i`, and `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += i` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `i`. Since `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `ans` is updated to `ans + len(a)`. The other variables (`tmp` and `y`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.
