Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `n` retains its original value, `x` retains its original value, `y` retains its original value, `ans` is `x + y - 1`, `tmp` is an empty list, `i` is 2, and the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is 2.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` was initially set to `x + y - 2`. After executing `ans += 1`, `ans` is incremented by 1, making its new value `x + y - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
