Output State: **`ans` is the value it had at the end of the previous iteration plus the second element of `tmp`, `tmp` is a sorted list with at least two elements, and `i` is the second element of `tmp`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += i` adds the value of `i` (which is the second element of `tmp`) to `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
