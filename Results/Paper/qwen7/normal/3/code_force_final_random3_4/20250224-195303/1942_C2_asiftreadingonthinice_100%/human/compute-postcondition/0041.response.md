Postcondition: `i` will be equal to `len(a) - 1`, `ans` will be incremented by 1 each time the difference between consecutive elements in the list `a` is exactly 2, `tmp` will contain the half of the difference between consecutive elements in `a` whenever this difference is even but not 2, and `tmp` will include the value of `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2` if the condition `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2)` is true, otherwise, `tmp` will include the value of `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2` if the condition is false and `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2)` is false but `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1])` is even.
