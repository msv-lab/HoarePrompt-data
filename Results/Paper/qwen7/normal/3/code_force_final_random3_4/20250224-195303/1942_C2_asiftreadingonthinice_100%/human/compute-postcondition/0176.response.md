Postcondition: **`a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `n` retains its original value, `x` retains its original value, `y` retains its original value, `ans` is either `x + y` or `x + y - 1`, `tmp` is a list containing one or more values of the form `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` where `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0`, and `i` is equal to `len(a)`. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`, then `ans` is `x + y`. Otherwise, `ans` is `x + y - 1` and `tmp` includes the value `((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)` if `((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0)` is true.**
