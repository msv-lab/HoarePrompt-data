Output State: **`tmp` must contain at least one element, `i` is no longer the first element of `tmp`, `ans` is the sum of the first element of `tmp` plus whatever was previously in `ans`, `y` is decreased by `i - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `y -= i - 1` decreases the value of `y` by the value of `i - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
