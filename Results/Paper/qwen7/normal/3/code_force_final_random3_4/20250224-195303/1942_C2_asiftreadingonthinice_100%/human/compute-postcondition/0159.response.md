Postcondition: **`a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `n` retains its original value, `x` retains its original value, `y` retains its original value, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is a list containing either 1 or the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, and `i` is 4 if `(a[4] - a[3]) % 2 == 0`, otherwise `i` remains 3.**
