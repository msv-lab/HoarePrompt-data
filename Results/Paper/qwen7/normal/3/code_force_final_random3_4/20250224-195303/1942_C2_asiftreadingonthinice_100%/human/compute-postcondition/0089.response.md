Output State: **`i` is 3, `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`, and `len(a)` is greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to the list `tmp`. Given that `i` is initially 2, after executing the line, `i` becomes 3. The value being appended to `tmp` is `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
