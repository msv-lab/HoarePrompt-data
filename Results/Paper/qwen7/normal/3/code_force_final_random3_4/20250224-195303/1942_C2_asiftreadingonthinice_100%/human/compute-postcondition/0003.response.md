Output State: **`ii` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list named `a`. The initial values of `ii`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
