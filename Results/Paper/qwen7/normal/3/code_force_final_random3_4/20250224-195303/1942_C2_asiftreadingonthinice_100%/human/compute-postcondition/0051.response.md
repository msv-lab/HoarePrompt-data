Postcondition: `i` is either `len(a) - 2` or `len(a) - 1`, `tmp` is a non-empty sorted list, `ans` is updated to `ans + (len(a) - 1)` if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, and `y` is updated to `y - (i - 1)` if `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`. If `y` is less than `i - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
