Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` from the list `tmp`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element `i` in `tmp`.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `tmp` must contain at least one element.
   - `i` is either the first element of `tmp` or no longer the first element of `tmp`.
   - If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, `ans` is updated by adding the first element of `tmp` (which is `i`) to `ans`, and `y` is decreased by `i - 1`.
   - If `y` is less than `i - 1`, `i` remains the first element of `tmp`, and the loop breaks.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `i` from `tmp`, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` itself.
   - After the previous iteration, `i` could either be the first element of `tmp` or no longer the first element of `tmp`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be the next element in `tmp`.

5. **Update the State**:
   - If `i` was the first element of `tmp`, it will now be the second element of `tmp`.
   - If `i` was not the first element of `tmp`, it will remain the same but will now be the first element of `tmp` for the next iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the next element in `tmp` being `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`tmp` must contain at least two elements, `i` is the second element of `tmp`, and `y` and `ans` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.**
