Postcondition: **`a` is a sorted list of integers from the input, `n` retains its original value, `x` retains its original value, `y` retains its original value, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is a list containing either 1 or the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`, and `i` is 2.**

This postcondition summarizes both cases: if `a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2`, then `tmp` contains 1; otherwise, `tmp` contains the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`. Both scenarios maintain the original values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `ans`, and keep `i` as 2.
