Postcondition: `a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1. If the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i - 1` is 2, then `ans` is 1. If the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i - 1` is even but not 2, then `tmp` contains the value `(a[1] - a[0]) // 2`.
