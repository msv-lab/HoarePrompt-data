Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: From the given information, after executing the if-else block, `i` will be equal to `len(a) - 1`. Therefore, `i` should start from `len(a) - 1` when the loop begins.

3. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each element in the `tmp` list. Since `tmp` is sorted and contains values derived from the list `a`, the loop will execute as long as `tmp` is not empty.

4. **Adjust the state of `tmp`**: Since `tmp` is used in the loop, it must be non-empty for the loop to execute. The `tmp` list is sorted and contains values based on the conditions described (half of the difference between consecutive elements in `a` when the difference is even but not 2, and `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2` if the condition is true).

5. **Combine the necessary adjustments**: We need to ensure that `i` starts from `len(a) - 1` and that `tmp` is non-empty and sorted.

**Final State Adjustment**:
State: **`i` is `len(a) - 1`, `tmp` is a non-empty sorted list**
