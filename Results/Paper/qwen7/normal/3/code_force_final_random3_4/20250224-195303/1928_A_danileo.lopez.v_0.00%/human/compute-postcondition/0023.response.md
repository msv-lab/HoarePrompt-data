Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \(t\) (1 ≤ \(t\) ≤ 10^4) followed by two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\) (1 ≤ \(a\), \(b\) ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even. If at least one of them is even, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with no explicit return value, but the output consists of 'Yes' or 'No' for each test case.**
