Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer \(t\) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\).

2. **Condition Check**: For each pair \((a, b)\), the program checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even. If at least one of them is even, it prints 'Yes', indicating that Bob can form another rectangle. If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, it prints 'No', indicating that Bob cannot form another rectangle.

3. **Edge Cases**: The logic handles all edge cases where \(a\) and \(b\) can be any integers between 1 and \(10^9\). The condition check ensures that if either dimension is even, it is possible to form another rectangle by cutting and rearranging the pieces.

Given the problem statement and the provided test cases, the program correctly identifies whether Bob can form another rectangle based on the criteria that at least one dimension must be even.

Correctness: **True**
