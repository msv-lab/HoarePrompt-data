State: **`t` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, _ is 0**

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `_` is a placeholder and typically starts at 0 when the loop begins. Therefore, `_` should be set to 0.
- The variable `t` is the one that controls the number of iterations of the loop. It must be a positive integer within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) for the loop to execute.

Since `t` is the only variable in the loop head that affects the loop's execution, and `_` is initialized to 0, these are the states that need to be adjusted.
