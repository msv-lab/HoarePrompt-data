Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `j`. The loop iterates from `n-1` to `0` with a step of `-1`.

2. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `cards` is a list of integers.
   - `dp[i][1]` is updated based on specific rules involving the value `2` in the `cards` list.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `j` is within the range `[n-1, 0]`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - At the end of the last iteration, `j` was set to the current value minus 1. Since the loop starts at `n-1` and decreases by 1 each iteration, the next value of `j` would be `j - 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must still be within the range `[0, n-1]`.

Given the initial state where `j` was part of the range `[n-1, 0]`, and considering the decrement in the loop, the next value of `j` will be `j - 1`.

Since the loop head only involves `j` and `n`, and `n` remains unchanged, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `j`:

**State: **`cards` is a list of integers, `dp[i][1]` is updated based on the following rules: if there is no occurrence of `j + 1` (which is 2) in the list `cards`, then `dp[i][1]` is updated to `dp[i + 1][1]`. Otherwise, `dp[i][1]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][1]`, `dp[i + 2][0] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][2]` if `cards.count(2) == 1`. Here, `j` is `j - 1` and `n` is 5.**
