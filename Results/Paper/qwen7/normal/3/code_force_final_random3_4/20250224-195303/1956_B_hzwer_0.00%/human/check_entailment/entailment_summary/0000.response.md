Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem using dynamic programming. However, the logic within the `func_1` function does not accurately reflect the game rules and the optimal strategy for maximizing the player's score.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: The initialization of `dp` matrix seems incorrect. The indices `dp[n-1][0]` and `dp[n-2][0]` are set to 0, but this doesn't align with the problem's requirements. The DP table should consider the current state of the game, including the cards available and the points scored.

2. **State Transition Logic**: The transition logic in the nested loops is flawed. The logic checks the count of each card and tries to decide whether to pick a card or not, but it does not correctly simulate the game's turns and the opponent's optimal strategy. The logic should account for the fact that Nene will always try to minimize your score while maximizing hers.

3. **Game Strategy**: The program does not simulate the game's turns properly. It assumes that the player can make decisions without considering the opponent's actions, which is incorrect. Nene's optimal strategy involves anticipating your moves and responding accordingly to minimize your score.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
