Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):`. This means the loop variable is `j`, and the range is defined by `n - 1` (inclusive) to `-1` (exclusive) with a step of `-1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `j`**: Since the loop starts from `n - 1` and goes down to `-1`, the initial value of `j` must be `n - 1`.

3. **Determine the state of `n`**: The state of `n` is mentioned as "the same as before," meaning its value remains unchanged from the state before the loop.

4. **Adjust the states**: We need to ensure that the loop can start with `j` being `n - 1`.

Given these points, the state before the loop should be adjusted to reflect that `j` starts at `n - 1` and `n` remains the same as before.

**State:**
**`i` is `i + 1`, `j` is `n - 1`, `n` is the same as before**
