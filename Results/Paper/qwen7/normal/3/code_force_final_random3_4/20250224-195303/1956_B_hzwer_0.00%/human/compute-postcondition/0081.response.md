Output State: **`dp[i][j]` is assigned the maximum value among `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.**

This means that the value of `dp[i][j]` is updated to be the highest value among the three options: `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
