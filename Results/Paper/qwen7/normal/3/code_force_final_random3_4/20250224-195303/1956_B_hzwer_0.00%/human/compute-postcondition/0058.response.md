Output State: **`dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum value among `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]` if `cards.count(j + 1)` is either 0 or 1. If `cards.count(j + 1) == 0`, then `dp[i][j]` is set to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If `cards.count(j + 1) == 1`, then `dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum value among `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `dp[i][j]` based on the conditions given. It does not affect any other variables, so the initial conditions for `dp[i][j]` and `cards.count(j + 1)` remain unchanged. The output state reflects the updated value of `dp[i][j]` according to the specified rules.
