Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in `func_1` is flawed and does not accurately simulate the game dynamics as described. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**: The initial conditions for the dynamic programming table (`dp`) are not correctly set up. The indices should represent the number of remaining cards in your hand and the number of points you have, but the current initialization doesn't reflect this properly.

2. **Logic for Filling DP Table**: The logic inside the nested loops for filling the DP table is incorrect. Specifically, the conditions for updating the DP table do not correctly model the game rules. For instance, the condition `if cards.count(j + 1) == 0:` checks if a particular card value `j+1` is not present in your hand, which is not relevant to the game logic. Similarly, the other conditions also do not correctly handle the game dynamics.

3. **Optimal Strategy for Nene**: The problem specifies that Nene will play optimally to maximize her score while minimizing yours. The current implementation does not account for this strategic behavior of Nene.

To correctly solve this problem, you would need to simulate the game turns and consider the optimal moves for both players. A more appropriate approach would involve simulating the game turns and considering the best possible moves for both players at each step. This might involve maintaining counts of available cards and strategically choosing moves to maximize your score while considering Nene's potential responses.
