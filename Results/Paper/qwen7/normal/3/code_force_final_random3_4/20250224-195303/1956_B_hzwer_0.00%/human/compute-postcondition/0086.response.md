Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop is iterating over `j` in reverse order from `n-1` to `0`. Therefore, the only variable in the loop head is `j`.

2. **Understand the postcondition**: The postcondition updates `dp[i][j]` based on certain conditions involving `dp[i+1][j]`, `dp[i+2][j-1] + 1`, and `dp[i+1][j+1]`. The specific conditions depend on the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list.

3. **Determine the state adjustments**:
   - Since the loop is iterating in reverse, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be decremented by 1.
   - The state of `dp[i][j]` will be updated based on the conditions mentioned in the postcondition, but the exact value is not specified here. We only need to know that it will be updated according to the rules given.

Given these points, we can conclude that the only state that needs to be adjusted is `j`, as it is the only variable in the loop head.

**State at the start of the next iteration**:
- `j` will be `j - 1` (decremented by 1).
- The other states (`dp[i][j]`, `cards`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`j` is `j - 1`**
