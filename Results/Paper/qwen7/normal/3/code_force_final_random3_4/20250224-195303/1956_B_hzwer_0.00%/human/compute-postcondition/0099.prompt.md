You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; the list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n represents the integers on the cards in your hand, where each integer from 1 through n appears at most twice; the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    cards = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [([0] * (n + 1)) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[n - 1][0] = 0
    dp[n - 2][0] = 0
    for i in range(n - 3, -1, -1):
        for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            if cards.count(j + 1) == 0:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]
            elif cards.count(j + 1) == 1:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])
        
    #State: The final output state after the loop executes all its iterations will be such that `dp[i][0]` contains the maximum value obtainable for each `i` from `0` to `n-1`. This value represents the optimal solution for the problem defined by the loop, which involves making decisions based on the count of occurrences of each integer in the `cards` list. Specifically, `dp[i][0]` reflects the best outcome for the subproblems starting from index `i` down to `0`, considering the conditions provided within the loop.
    return dp[0][0]
    #The program returns the maximum value obtainable when starting from index 0 and considering the conditions provided within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a predefined list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` under the given constraints. It returns the maximum value obtainable when starting from index 0 and considering the conditions provided within the loop.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the maximum value obtainable when starting from index 0 and considering the conditions provided within the loop.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
