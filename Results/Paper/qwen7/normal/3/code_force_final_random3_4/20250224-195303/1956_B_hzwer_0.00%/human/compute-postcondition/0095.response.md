Output State: The final state of `dp[i][j]` after the loop executes all its iterations will be determined by the maximum value among the following possibilities for each `i` and `j`:

- `dp[i + 1][j]`: This is the value of `dp[i][j]` from the previous iteration or subproblem.
- `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`: This is considered if `j + 1` exists in the `cards` list exactly once, and it adds 1 to the value of `dp[i + 2][j - 1]`.
- `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`: This is considered if `j + 1` exists in the `cards` list more than once, and it uses the value of `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.

The final value of `dp[i][j]` will be the highest of these three values for each `i` and `j` after the loop has completed all its iterations.
