Output State: **`nodes` is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of a tree with `n` nodes; `leaves` contains the key.**

Explanation: The code snippet `leaves.append(key)` appends the `key` to the `leaves` list. This operation does not affect the `nodes` dictionary itself, but it adds the `key` to the `leaves` list. Therefore, the `nodes` dictionary remains unchanged, and the `leaves` list now includes the `key`.
