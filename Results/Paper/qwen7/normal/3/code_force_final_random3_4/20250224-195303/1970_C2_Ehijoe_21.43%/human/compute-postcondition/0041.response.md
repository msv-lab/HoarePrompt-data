Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5), an integer `t` (where t = 1), a list of tuples `edges` representing the edges of a tree, and an integer `start` (where 1 ≤ start ≤ n). The function returns a value based on the structure of the tree and the starting node.**

This means the function `func_2` takes an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a tree, an integer `t` which is fixed at 1, a list of tuples `edges` that define the connections between nodes in the tree, and an integer `start` indicating the initial node. The function then processes this information to determine and return some specific value or outcome related to the tree structure starting from the given node.
