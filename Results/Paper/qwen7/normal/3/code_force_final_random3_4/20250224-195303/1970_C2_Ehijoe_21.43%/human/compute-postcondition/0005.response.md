Output State: **`i` is 0, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `u, v = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `u` and `v`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was initially set to 0. The initial conditions for `n` (between 2 and 2Ã—10^5 inclusive) are still valid but `n` itself is not directly involved in the given code snippet. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values for `u` and `v`, while keeping `i` and the range condition for `n` intact.
