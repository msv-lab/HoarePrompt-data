Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, `edges` is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree, where each tuple (u, v) indicates an undirected edge between nodes u and v, and `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, representing the initial node where the stone is placed, `n` is updated to the integer value entered by the user, and `t` is updated to the integer value entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `t`. Since the input values replace the original values of `n` and `t`, the new values of `n` and `t` are the integers entered by the user. The other variables (`edges` and `start`) remain unchanged.
