Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves a game played on a tree structure where players take turns moving a stone from one node to another. The game is played for a fixed number of rounds, and the player who cannot make a move loses. The goal is to determine the winner based on the optimal play strategy.

2. **Analysis of Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the distances from the starting node to all other nodes in the tree.
   - It uses recursion to traverse the tree and build a list of distances.
   - The function is correctly implemented to handle the tree traversal and distance calculation.

3. **Analysis of Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input, constructs the tree, and identifies leaf nodes.
   - It then calls `func_1` to get the distances from the starting node to all other nodes.
   - The function checks if any of these distances are odd. If so, it prints "Ron"; otherwise, it prints "Hermione".
   - The logic is correct because in a tree, the parity of the distance between two nodes determines the winner. If there is at least one odd distance, Ron wins because he can force the game into a position where Hermione cannot make a move.

4. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles the input and constructs the tree.
   - It accurately calculates the distances from the starting node.
   - The decision logic based on the parity of the distances is correct and aligns with the game's rules.

Given the analysis, the program meets the requirements of the problem statement and correctly determines the winner based on the optimal play strategy.

Correctness: **True**
