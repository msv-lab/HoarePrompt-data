Output State: **`i` is 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `nodes[u]` contains `[u, v, 2]`, `n` must be greater than 3.**

Explanation: The code appends `u` to the list `nodes[v]`. Initially, `nodes[v]` contains `[u, v]`. After executing `nodes[v].append(u)`, `nodes[v]` will contain `[u, v, u]`. Since `u` is an input integer, we keep it as is. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The condition that `n` must be greater than 3 is still valid.
