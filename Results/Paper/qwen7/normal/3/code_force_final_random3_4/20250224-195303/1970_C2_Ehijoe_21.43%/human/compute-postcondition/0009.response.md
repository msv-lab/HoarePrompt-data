Output State: **`i` is 1, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `nodes[v]` contains `[u]`**

Explanation: The code `u, v = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space and assigns them to `u` and `v`. The initial values of `i`, `u`, `v`, and `nodes[v]` are updated accordingly. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The value of `u` and `v` are now the integers entered by the user, and `nodes[v]` is updated to contain `[u]`.
