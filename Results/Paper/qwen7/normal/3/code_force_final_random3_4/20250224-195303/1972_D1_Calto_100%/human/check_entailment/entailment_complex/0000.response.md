Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `a` and `b`. This part of the code is correct and well-understood.

2. **Function `func_2`**: The current implementation of `func_2` does not seem to match the problem statement. The logic inside the function does not correctly calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. Specifically:
   - The variables `x` and `y` are defined in a way that does not align with the problem constraints.
   - The loop variable `i` seems to be used in a manner that does not correctly iterate over possible values of \(b\) and check the conditions involving \(a\) and \(b\).
   - The final value of `cnt` (20) and the specific values of `i`, `x`, and `y` mentioned do not correspond to any meaningful calculation related to the problem.

Given the discrepancy between the expected behavior and the actual implementation of `func_2`, the program as written does not solve the problem correctly.

Correctness: **False**
