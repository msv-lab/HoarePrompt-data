### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Understanding the Problem:
- We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\).
- The condition is that \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Given Functions:
- `func_1(a, b)` computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\). This function is correct because it uses the Euclidean algorithm, which is a well-known and efficient method for computing GCD.
- `func_2(n, m)` is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition. Let's examine this function closely.

#### Analyzing `func_2(n, m)`:
- The function iterates over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
- For each \(b\), it calculates \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\).
- It then increments the count `cnt` by `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.

### Issues with `func_2(n, m)`:

1. **Incorrect Calculation:**
   - The expressions \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\) do not seem to have any relation to the problem statement.
   - These calculations do not help in determining whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **No Implementation of the Condition:**
   - The function does not check whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for any pair \((a, b)\).
   - Instead, it seems to be trying to count something else, possibly related to quadratic residues or some other unrelated computation.

3. **Incorrect Logic:**
   - The function `func_2` does not correctly implement the required condition. It should iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and check the condition for each pair, but it does not do so.

### Correct Approach:
- To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).
- The function `func_1` is used to compute the GCD, which is correct.
- We need to modify `func_2` to correctly check the condition for each pair.

### Corrected Function `func_2`:
```python
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for b in range(1, m + 1):
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt
```

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment correctly identified that the provided `func_2` does not correctly solve the problem.
- The corrected approach involves iterating over all pairs \((a, b)\) and checking the condition, which aligns with the problem requirements.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
