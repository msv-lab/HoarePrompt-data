You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6.
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        
        y = i * i
        
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
        
    #State: Output State: `cnt` is 20, `i` is 5, `x` is `n - 27`, `y` is 25, `m` must be at least 4.
    #
    #To understand this, let's break it down:
    #
    #- Initially, `cnt` is -1.
    #- After the first iteration (`i` is 2), `cnt` becomes 1.
    #- After the second iteration (`i` is 3), `cnt` becomes 4.
    #- After the third iteration (`i` is 4), `cnt` becomes 10.
    #
    #Each time the loop runs, `cnt` is updated by adding `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` where `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`.
    #
    #For the fourth iteration (`i` is 5):
    #- `x` is calculated as `n - (5 * 5 - 5) = n - 20`.
    #- `y` is `5 * 5 = 25`.
    #- The term `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` will add 1 to `cnt` because `x` divided by `y` is less than 1, so `math.ceil(x / y)` is 1, and `x % y` is not zero, so `(x % y == 0)` is 0. Therefore, `cnt` becomes 10 + 1 = 11.
    #
    #For the fifth iteration (`i` is 6):
    #- `x` is calculated as `n - (6 * 6 - 6) = n - 30`.
    #- `y` is `6 * 6 = 36`.
    #- The term `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` will add 1 to `cnt` because `x` divided by `y` is less than 1, so `math.ceil(x / y)` is 1, and `x % y` is not zero, so `(x % y == 0)` is 0. Therefore, `cnt` becomes 11 + 1 = 12.
    #
    #Continuing this pattern, we can see that each iteration adds 1 to `cnt`. Since the loop runs from `i = 1` to `m`, and we know `m` must be at least 4, the total number of iterations is `m`. Given the pattern, after `m` iterations, `cnt` will be `-1 + m`. If `m` is 4, then `cnt` would be `-1 + 4 = 3`. However, based on the provided information, the correct value for `m` is at least 4, leading us to conclude that after all iterations, `cnt` will be 20, with `i` being 5, `x` being `n - 27`, and `y` being 25.
    return cnt
    #The program returns 20, with `i` being 5, `x` being `n - 27`, and `y` being 25.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, both of which are positive integers with the constraint 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6. It returns 20, with `i` being 5, `x` being `n - 27`, and `y` being 25.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns 20, with `i` being 5, `x` being `n - 27`, and `y` being 25.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
