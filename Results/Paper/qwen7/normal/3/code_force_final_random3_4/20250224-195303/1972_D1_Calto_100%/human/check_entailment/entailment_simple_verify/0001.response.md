### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's re-examine the provided functions and the logic within `func_2(n, m)` more carefully:

1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of `a` and `b`. This part is correct.

2. **Function `func_2(n, m)`**:
   - The function iterates over all possible values of `b` from 1 to `m`.
   - For each `b`, it calculates `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`.
   - It then increments the count `cnt` by `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.
   - The expressions `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` do not relate to the problem statement at all. They do not help in checking whether `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

3. **Checking the Condition**:
   - The problem requires checking if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The function does not perform this check. Instead, it performs a calculation that is unrelated to the problem.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - In the example provided, the function returns 20, but this is not the correct count of valid pairs for any given `n` and `m`.

### Detailed Breakdown of `func_2(n, m)`:

- **Iteration Loop**:
  - The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `m`.
  - For each `i`, it calculates `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`.
  - The increment `cnt += math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` is added to `cnt`.
  - This incrementation does not follow the required condition of the problem.

### Correct Approach:

- To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
- The function should use the GCD computed by `func_1(a, b)` and check the condition for each pair.

### Conclusion:

The provided function `func_2(n, m)` does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
