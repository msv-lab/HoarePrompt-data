Output State: `cnt` is 21, `i` is 5, `x` is `n - 27`, `y` is 25, `m` must be at least 4.

To calculate this, we observe the pattern in the given states after each iteration. The value of `cnt` increases by 6, 6, and 7 in the first three iterations. We can infer that the increment might follow a similar pattern or a slight variation. Given the increments, we can predict the next few steps:

- After 1st iteration: `cnt` is 1
- After 2nd iteration: `cnt` is 4
- After 3rd iteration: `cnt` is 10

The increments are 3, 6, and 7. If we continue this pattern, the next increments could be 8, 9, and so on. Assuming a simple linear increase in the increment by 1 each time, we can estimate the next few steps:

- After 4th iteration: `cnt` would be 10 + 8 = 18
- After 5th iteration: `cnt` would be 18 + 9 = 27

Thus, after all iterations, `cnt` would be 21. The variable `i` would be 5, `x` would be `n - 27`, and `y` would be 25, with `m` needing to be at least 4 to allow for these iterations.
