Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Specifically, the `func_2` function does not accurately count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. The logic inside `func_2` seems to be attempting to solve a different problem, and it does not correctly handle the conditions specified in the problem statement.

To solve this problem correctly, you would need to iterate through all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within their respective ranges and check if they satisfy the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The provided `func_1` for calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) is correct, but it is not used appropriately in `func_2`.
