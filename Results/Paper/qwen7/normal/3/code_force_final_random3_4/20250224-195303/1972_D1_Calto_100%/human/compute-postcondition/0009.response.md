Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `m`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is within the range `1` to `m + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cnt` is 4
   - `i` is 3
   - `x` is `n - 10`
   - `y` is 9

4. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 each iteration.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i <= m + 1`.

5. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` was 3 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 4 in the next iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than or equal to `m + 1`.
   - Therefore, `m` must be at least 3 (since `i` is now 4).

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be updated to 4.
   - `m` must be at least 3 for the loop to continue.

7. **Final state**:
   - `cnt` remains 4.
   - `i` is now 4.
   - `x` is `n - 10` (unchanged).
   - `y` is 9 (unchanged).
   - `m` must be at least 3.

Thus, the final state is:

State: **`cnt` is 4, `i` is 4, `x` is `n - 10`, `y` is 9, `m` must be at least 3**
