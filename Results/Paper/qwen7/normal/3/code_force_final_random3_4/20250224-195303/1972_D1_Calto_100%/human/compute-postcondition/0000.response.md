Output State: **`cnt` is -1**

The initial state indicates that `n` and `m` are positive integers within the range of 1 to 2 * 10^6. The code assigns `-1` to the variable `cnt`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the output state is that `cnt` is -1, while `n` and `m` retain their unspecified but positive integer values within the given range.
