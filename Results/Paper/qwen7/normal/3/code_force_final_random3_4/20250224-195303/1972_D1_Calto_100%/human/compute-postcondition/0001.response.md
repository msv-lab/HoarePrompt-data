State: **`cnt` is -1, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `m`.
2. The loop condition `range(1, m + 1)` indicates that the loop will start with `i = 1` and continue as long as `i <= m`.
3. For the loop to execute at least once, `m` must be greater than 0 because if `m` is 0 or negative, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.
4. The variable `cnt` is not directly involved in the loop condition and its initial value `-1` does not affect the loop's execution. Therefore, it does not need to be adjusted.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` set to 1 (the starting value of the loop), `m` must be greater than 0 (to ensure the loop can execute at least once), and `cnt` remains unchanged as it is not part of the loop condition.
