### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summaries step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Problem Description Analysis:**
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function computes the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - It is correctly implemented and is not used in the main logic of the program.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - The function summary states that after iterating from \(i = 1\) to \(m\), the counter `cnt` is updated based on certain calculations involving `x` and `y`.
   - However, the function summary mentions that the final value of `cnt` is 20 when `i` is 5, `x` is `n - 27`, and `y` is 25. This does not align with the problem statement and suggests that the logic inside `func_2` is incorrect.

4. **Main Logic of `func_2`:**
   - The current implementation of `func_2` does not correctly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - Specifically, the logic inside the loop does not properly handle the GCD calculation and the condition checking.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not properly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_2` does not correctly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), and the provided function summary does not accurately reflect the intended logic.
