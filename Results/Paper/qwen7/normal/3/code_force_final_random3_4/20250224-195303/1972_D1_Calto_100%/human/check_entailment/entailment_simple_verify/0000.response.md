### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided code.

#### Problem Description:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Provided Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - It is correctly implemented and is used to compute the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
   - The logic inside `func_2` is flawed and does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - Specifically, the expression `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` do not relate to the problem requirements.

#### Annotated Code Explanation:
- The annotated code incorrectly states that `cnt` will be 20 after the loop, which is not true. The actual logic inside `func_2` does not correctly count the valid pairs.
- The loop in `func_2` iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m\), but it does not correctly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    result = count_valid_pairs(n, m)
    print(result)
```

This corrected version correctly counts the number of valid pairs by iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking the condition.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem due to the flawed logic in `func_2`.

**Final: False**
