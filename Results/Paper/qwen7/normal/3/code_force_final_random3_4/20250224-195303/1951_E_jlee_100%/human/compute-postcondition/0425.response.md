Output State: **`count2` is 0, `count` is greater than 0, `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`, and the condition `count > 1` is false.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the context and the statement itself does not change any variable values, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
