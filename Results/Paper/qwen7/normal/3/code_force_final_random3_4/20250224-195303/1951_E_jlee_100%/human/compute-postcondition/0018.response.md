Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list containing the first character of the input string, `n` is 1, `done` is False, and `x` is the first character of the input string. If the current value of `x` is not equal to the last element of `s`, the condition holds true as per the if part. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged from the if part.
