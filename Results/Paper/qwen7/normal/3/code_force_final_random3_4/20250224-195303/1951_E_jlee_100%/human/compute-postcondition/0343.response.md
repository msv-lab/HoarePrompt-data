Postcondition: `s` is a string, `done` is True, `count` is `j`, `count2` is either incremented by 1, reset to 0, or remains unchanged, `j` is `n`. If `count2` is less than `count`, `s[j]` is set to `x` if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1. If `count2` equals `count`, `count2` is reset to 0. Otherwise, the values of `s`, `done`, `count`, `count2`, and `j` remain unchanged.
