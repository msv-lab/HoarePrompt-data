Postcondition: `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `s[j]` is `s[1]`, `count` is 1, `count2` is either 0 or 1, and `done` is True. If `count2` equals `count`, `done` remains True. If `count2` is greater than `count`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` is greater than 1, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
