Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is 0
- `n` is greater than 0
- `s[j]` is `s[0]`
- `count` is 0
- `count2` remains unchanged and is either less than or equal to `count`
- `done` is True

The print statement is simply `print('YES')`.

Since the print statement directly outputs the string `'YES'`, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
