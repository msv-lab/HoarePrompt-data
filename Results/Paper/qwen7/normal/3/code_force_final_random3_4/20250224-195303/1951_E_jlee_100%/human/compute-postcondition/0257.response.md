Postcondition: **`s` is a string, `done` is True, `count` is greater than 0, and `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`. If `count2` equals `count`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `count2` is greater than `count`, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
