Postcondition: `s` is a string, `done` is True, `count` is greater than 0, and `count` was `j`. If the character at index `j` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If the character at index `j` is equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j`, `count2` is incremented by 1.
