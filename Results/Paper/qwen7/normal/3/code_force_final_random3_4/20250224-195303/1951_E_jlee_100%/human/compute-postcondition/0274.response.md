Output State: **`s` is a string, `done` is True, `count` is `j`, `count2` is either incremented by 1 or remains unchanged, `j` is `n`, and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are assigned new values or affected by the `continue` statement, the values of `s`, `done`, `count`, `count2`, and `j` remain unchanged. The only effect is that the loop continues to the next iteration.
