Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `j` is 0.
- The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to the value of `s[n - 1 - j]`.

Given these conditions, let's break down the print statement:

1. `j` is 0.
2. `s[n - 1 - j]` becomes `s[n - 1]` because `j` is 0.
3. The condition states that `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1]`.

Therefore, the print statement `print(string)` will print the string `string`, where `string` is the entire string `s` because no specific part of the string is being sliced or modified in the print statement.

Output: **string**
