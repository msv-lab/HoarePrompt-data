Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `j` is equal to `count + 2`.
- `done` is `True`.
- `count` is equal to `j`.
- `count2` is either 0 or greater than or equal to `count` (if `count` > 1). In both cases, `count2` is increased by 1 if the condition `s[j] != x` and `count < 1` is not met.

The print statement is simply `print('YES')`.

Given this information, the print statement will output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
