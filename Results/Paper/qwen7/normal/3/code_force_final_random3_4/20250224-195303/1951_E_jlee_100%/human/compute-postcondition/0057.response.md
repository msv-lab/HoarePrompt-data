Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `j` is equal to `count`, `done` is False, `count` is equal to `j`, and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the conditions and values of the variables before the `continue` statement still hold true after its execution.
