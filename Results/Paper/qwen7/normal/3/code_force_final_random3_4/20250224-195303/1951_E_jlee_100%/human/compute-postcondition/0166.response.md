Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `j` is equal to `count + 2`, `done` remains True, `count` is equal to `j`, `count2` is 0, and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified within the scope of the `continue` statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
