Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6. It returns a result for each string `s` based on its length and content.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `t` indicating the number of strings to process, followed by `t` strings `s`. The function processes each string `s` and returns a result for each string based on its length and content, ensuring the total length of all strings across all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
