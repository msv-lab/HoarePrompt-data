Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is a string.
- `done` is `True`.
- `count` is greater than 0 and was equal to `j`.
- The character at index `j` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j`.
- The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.
- `count2` is less than `count`.

The `print('YES')` statement will simply print the string `'YES'`.
