Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from the input string with the length of 1, `n` is 1, `done` is False.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop context provided, the variables `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, and `done` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
