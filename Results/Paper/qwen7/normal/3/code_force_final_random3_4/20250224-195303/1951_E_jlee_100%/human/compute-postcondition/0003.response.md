Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from the input string.**

The code `s = list(string)` converts the input string into a list of its characters. The variables `t` and `i` remain unchanged, and the new variable `s` is created and assigned the list of characters from the input string.
