Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is 1
- `n` is greater than 0
- `s[j]` is `s[1]`
- `count` is 1
- `count2` is either 0 or 1
- `done` is True

The print statement is:
```python
print(string[:j], string[j:])
```

Given `j` is 1, `string[:j]` will be the substring of `string` from the start up to but not including the index `j`, which means it will be the first character of `string`.

`string[j:]` will be the substring of `string` starting from index `j` to the end, which means it will be the rest of the string starting from the second character.

Therefore, the output will be the first character of `string` followed by the rest of the string starting from the second character.

Output: **string[0], string[1:]**
