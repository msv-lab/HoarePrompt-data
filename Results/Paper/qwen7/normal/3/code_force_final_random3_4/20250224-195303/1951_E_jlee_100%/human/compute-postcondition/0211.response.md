Postcondition: `i` is 4, `t` must be greater than 4, `done` is False, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `x` is the first character of the list `s`. If `x` appears in the list `s` as many times as the length of `s` minus one, the conditions remain unchanged.
