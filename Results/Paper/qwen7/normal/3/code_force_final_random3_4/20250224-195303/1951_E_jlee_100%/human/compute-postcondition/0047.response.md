Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `j` is 0.
- The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to the value of `s[n - 1 - j]`.

The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'YES'`. The values of `n` and `j` do not affect the output of this specific print statement, as it is hardcoded to print `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
