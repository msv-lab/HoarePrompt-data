Output State: **`i` is 4, `t` must be greater than 4, `done` is False, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from the input string**.

The code `s = list(string)` converts the input string into a list of its characters and assigns it to the variable `s`. The values of `i`, `t`, `done`, and `string` remain unchanged.
