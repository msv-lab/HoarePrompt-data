Output: **YES**

Explanation: The initial state tells us that the character at index `j` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j`. This means that the string `s` is not a palindrome. The print statement simply outputs "YES", which does not depend on the content of the string `s` but rather on the condition given. Therefore, regardless of the specific characters in the string, the output will always be "YES".
