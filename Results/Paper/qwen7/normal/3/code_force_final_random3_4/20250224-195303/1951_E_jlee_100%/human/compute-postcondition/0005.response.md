Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the length of the list `s`, `done` is False.**

The code initializes the variable `done` to `False`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `i`, `string`, `s`, or `n`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and `done` is set to `False`.
