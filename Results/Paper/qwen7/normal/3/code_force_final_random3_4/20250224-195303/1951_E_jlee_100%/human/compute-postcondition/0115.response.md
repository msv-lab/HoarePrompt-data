Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `j` is equal to `count + 1`, `done` is True, `count` is greater than 0, and `count2` is either greater than or equal to `count` (if `count` > 1) or 0 (otherwise). If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
