Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop head is `for result in results:`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `result` and `results`.

2. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `results` is a non-empty list.

3. **Understand the Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list.
   - In each iteration, `result` takes the value of the current element in the `results` list.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `results` is a non-empty list, there will always be at least one element left to iterate over.
   - After the current iteration, `result` will hold the value of the current element, and `results` will still be a non-empty list (since it has at least one element left).

5. **Update the State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must still be a non-empty list.
   - `result` will be set to the next element in the list.

### Conclusion:

Given that `results` is a non-empty list at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `results` must still be a non-empty list, and `result` will be set to the next element in the list.

### Final State:

State: **`results` is a non-empty list, `result` is the next element in the list**
