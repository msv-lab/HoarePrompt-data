Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `idx` is `idx + data[idx]`, `n` is `data[idx - data[idx]]`, `a` is a list of integers starting from `data[idx - data[idx]]` and having length `data[idx]`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(data[idx], a)`, `t` is `t - 1`**.

This means that the value of `idx` is updated to `idx + data[idx]`. The value of `n` is set to `data[idx - data[idx]]`. The list `a` starts from `data[idx - data[idx]]` and has a length of `data[idx]`. The `results` list now contains an additional element, which is the return value of the function `func_1(data[idx], a)`. The variable `t` is decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
