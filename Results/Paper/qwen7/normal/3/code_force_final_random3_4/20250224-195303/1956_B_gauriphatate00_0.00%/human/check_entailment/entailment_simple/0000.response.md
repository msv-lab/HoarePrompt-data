Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves two players, you and Nene, playing a card game. Each player starts with \( n \) cards, and the goal is to maximize the number of points you can get. Points are awarded when a player places a card on the table that matches a card already on the table. Nene plays optimally to maximize her score while minimizing yours.

2. **Analyzing Function `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` takes two parameters: `n` (half the number of cards) and `a` (a list of integers representing the cards in your hand).
   - It uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each integer in `a`.
   - It calculates the number of pairs of integers that appear exactly twice (`pairs`).
   - It returns the minimum of `pairs` and `n // 2`.

3. **Analyzing Function `func_2`**:
   - `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles the reading of multiple test cases and ensures that the input is processed according to the problem constraints.
   - The logic inside the loop is correct: it reads the necessary data for each test case, calls `func_1`, and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies the number of pairs of cards that can be played immediately (i.e., pairs of cards with the same number).
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results.
   - Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the functions handle all cases as required.

Based on the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
