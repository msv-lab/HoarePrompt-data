### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Input**: An integer `n` and a list `a` of integers.
- **Output**: The minimum value between the number of pairs of integers in `a` that occur exactly twice and half the number of cards (`n // 2`).

This function aims to calculate the maximum number of points you can get. Here's how it works:
1. It uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
2. It counts the number of pairs (i.e., integers that appear exactly twice).
3. It returns the minimum value between this count and `n // 2`.

This logic aligns with the problem statement because:
- Each time you place a card on the table, you can earn a point if there is already a card with the same integer on the table.
- The number of pairs of identical cards is the maximum number of points you can achieve if you play optimally.
- However, since Nene also plays optimally to minimize your score, the actual number of points you can get is limited by `n // 2` (since Nene will try to prevent you from getting more points).

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Input**: Multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t`, followed by `t` sets of data.
- **Output**: Prints the result for each test case.

This function:
1. Reads the input data from standard input.
2. Processes each test case by calling `func_1` for each set of data.
3. Prints the result for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the expected output, `func_2` correctly processes the input and calls `func_1` appropriately.

### Conclusion:
Both functions together correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
