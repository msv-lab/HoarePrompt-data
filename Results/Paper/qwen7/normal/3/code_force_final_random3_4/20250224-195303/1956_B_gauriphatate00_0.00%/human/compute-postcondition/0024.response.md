Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations. The variable `data` remains unchanged. The variable `idx` is now equal to the original value of `idx` plus the sum of `n` for each iteration of the loop. For each iteration, `n` was determined by `data[idx - n]`. The variable `t` is now 0 since it was decremented in each iteration until it reached 0. The variable `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, a)` for each iteration, with a total length equal to the number of iterations. The variable `a` is not explicitly defined in the final state as it is a local variable within each iteration of the loop.

In simpler terms, after all iterations, `data` stays the same, `idx` is increased by the sum of `n` values from each iteration, `t` is 0, and `results` contains the outputs from calling `func_1(n, a)` for each iteration.
