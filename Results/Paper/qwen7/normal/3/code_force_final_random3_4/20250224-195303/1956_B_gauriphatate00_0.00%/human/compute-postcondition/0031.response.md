Based on the initial state provided, `results` must still be a non-empty list, and `result` will be set to the next element in the list. Since `results` is a non-empty list, it contains at least one element. When the code snippet `print(result)` is executed, `result` will be set to the next element in the list `results`.

However, the exact value of the next element in the list is not specified. Therefore, we can only describe it in general terms.

Output: **the next element in the list results**
