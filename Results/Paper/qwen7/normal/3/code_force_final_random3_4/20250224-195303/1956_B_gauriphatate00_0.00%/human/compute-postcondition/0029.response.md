Based on the initial state provided, `results` is a non-empty list, and for the loop to execute one more time, `results` must still be a non-empty list. This means that after removing the first element from `results`, it is still non-empty. Consequently, `result` will be set to the next element in the list.

Since `results` is a non-empty list and we are printing the next element in the list after the first element has been removed, `result` will be the second element of the original `results` list.

Output: **the second element of the original results list**
