Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `idx` is idx + 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `a` is a list of integers starting from `data[idx]` and having length `n`.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `a` by converting a slice of `data` starting from `idx` and having a length of `n` (where `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`) into integers using the `map` function. The original values of `data` and `idx` remain unchanged, but `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[idx]`, and `a` is created as specified.
