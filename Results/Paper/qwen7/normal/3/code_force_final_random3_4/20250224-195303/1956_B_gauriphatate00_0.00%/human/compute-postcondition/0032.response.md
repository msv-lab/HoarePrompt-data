Output State: **The loop has executed all its iterations, so `t` is now 0. `idx` is pointing to the position right after the last list `a` was processed. `a` contains integers from the current position of `idx` to `idx + n`. `results` is a list of function outputs from each iteration of the loop, with a total of `t` elements (which is 3 in this case). `data` remains unchanged throughout the process.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `t` is 0 because all iterations are done. `idx` points to the position right after the last list `a` was processed. `a` contains integers from the current position of `idx` to `idx + n`. `results` is a list of the function outputs from each of the 3 iterations of the loop, and `data` stays as it was initially.
