Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using spaces.**

Explanation: The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input using `input()`, which is set to `sys.stdin.read` in the initial state, and then splits this input into a list of strings based on spaces. The number of elements in this list corresponds to the value of `t`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, but now `data` holds the split input.
