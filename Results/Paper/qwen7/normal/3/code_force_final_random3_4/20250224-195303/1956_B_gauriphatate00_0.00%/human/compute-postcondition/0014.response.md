Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `idx` is `idx + 1`, `n` is `data[idx - data[idx]]`, `a` is a list of integers starting from `data[idx - data[idx]]` and having length `data[idx]`, `results` is a list with one additional element which is the return value of `func_1(data[idx], a)`, `t` is `t - 1`**

Explanation: The line `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous values. Therefore, `idx` is updated to `idx + 1`, while `data`, `n`, `a`, `results`, and `t` retain their original values.
