Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 3 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to len(vx) - 4, `ops` is a list containing two elements \[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)\], `v3` is the result of calling `q(0)`, and `_` is the second return value of `q(0)` which is ignored.**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple \((v3, 0)\) and another tuple \((v1, 0)\) to the list `ops`. Since `v3` is the result of calling `q(0)` and `_` is the second return value of `q(0)` which is ignored, the only relevant information is that `ops` now contains these two tuples. The values of `t`, `n`, `vx`, and `v3` remain unchanged from their initial states.
