Output State: **`v1` is `len(vx) - 3`, `v2` is `len(vx) - 1`, `vx` does not contain its `v3` element, `v3` is the return value of `q(0)`, `ops` is `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`**

Explanation: The code adds two tuples to the list `ops`. The first tuple is `(v3, 0)` and the second tuple is `(v1, 0)`. Since `v1` and `v2` are defined as `len(vx) - 3` and `len(vx) - 1` respectively, their values remain unchanged. The variable `v3` retains its value as the return value of `q(0)`. The `ops` list now contains these two tuples.
