Output State: **`v1` is `len(vx) - 3`, `v2` is `len(vx) - 1`, `vx` does not contain its `v1` element, `v3` is the return value of `q(0)` and `_` is the ignored return value of `q(0)`**.

This means that `v3` has been assigned the value returned by the function `q(0)`, while the second return value of `q(0)` (assigned to `_`) is ignored. The values of `v1` and `v2` remain unchanged, and `vx` still does not contain its `v1` element.
