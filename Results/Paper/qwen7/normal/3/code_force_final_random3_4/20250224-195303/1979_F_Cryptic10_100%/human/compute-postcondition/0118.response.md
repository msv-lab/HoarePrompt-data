Postcondition: `vx` has at least one element, `v2` is either the second last or the third last element of `vx` depending on the condition `v2 > 0`. If `v2 > 0`, `vx` has at least 1 element (excluding the second last element which was moved), `v2` is the second last element of `vx`, `ops` is a list containing a tuple `(None, v2)`, and `v1` is removed from `vx`. If `v2 <= 0`, `vx` has at least one less element, `v2` is the third last element of `vx`, `ops` has an additional element `(None, 0)`, and `(None, 0)` is added to `ops`.
