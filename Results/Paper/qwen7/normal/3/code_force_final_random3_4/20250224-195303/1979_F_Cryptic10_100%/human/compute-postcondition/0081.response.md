Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `v1` and `v2`, which are extracted from the tuples in `ops[::-1]`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop iterates over the tuples in `ops[::-1]`.
   - For each tuple `(v1, v2)`, it checks if the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`. If true, it appends `v1` to `p2`; otherwise, it appends `v1` to `p1`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `vx` is a set containing the two largest integers from the original set.
   - `p1` is a list of the original elements in `vx`.
   - `p2` is an empty list.
   - `ops` must contain at least one tuple.
   - `v1` is the first element of the last tuple in `ops[::-1]`.
   - `v2` is the second element of the last tuple in `ops[::-1]`.
   - `p2` has appended `v1` if the last element of `p1` is equal to `v2`, otherwise `p1` has appended `v1`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `ops[::-1]`, the next tuple in the reversed list will be used.
   - The next tuple will be the second-to-last tuple in the original `ops` list.
   - Therefore, `v1` will be the first element of the second-to-last tuple in `ops`.
   - `v2` will be the second element of the second-to-last tuple in `ops`.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `ops` remains unchanged as the loop will use the next tuple in the reversed list.
   - `v1` becomes the first element of the second-to-last tuple in `ops`.
   - `v2` becomes the second element of the second-to-last tuple in `ops`.

Given these steps, the updated states for the next iteration are:

- `vx` remains the same as it is not involved in the loop.
- `p1` and `p2` remain the same as they are not directly modified by the loop.
- `ops` remains the same.
- `v1` becomes the first element of the second-to-last tuple in `ops`.
- `v2` becomes the second element of the second-to-last tuple in `ops`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`vx` is a set containing the two largest integers from the original set, `p1` is a list of the original elements in `vx`, `p2` is an empty list, `ops` must contain at least one tuple, `v1` is the first element of the second-to-last tuple in `ops`, `v2` is the second element of the second-to-last tuple in `ops`**.
