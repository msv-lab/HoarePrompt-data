Output State: **`v1` is equal to `len(vx) - 4`, `v2` is equal to `len(vx) - 2`, `vx` has had its `v1` element removed, and `v1`, `v2` are reassigned such that `v1` is `len(vx) - 2` and `v2` is `len(vx) - 1`.**

Explanation: Initially, `v1` is equal to `len(vx) - 4` and `v2` is equal to `len(vx) - 2`. After removing the `v1`-th element from `vx`, the length of `vx` decreases by 1. The code then reassigns `v1` and `v2` such that `v1` is now `len(vx) - 2` (since the length decreased by 1) and `v2` is `len(vx) - 1`. The precondition that `len(vx)` must be greater than 3 is still valid.
