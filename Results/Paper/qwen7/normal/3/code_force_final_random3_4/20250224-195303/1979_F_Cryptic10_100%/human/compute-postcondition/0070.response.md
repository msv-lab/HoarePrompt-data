Output State: **`v1` is `len(vx) - 3`, `v2` is `len(vx) - 1`, `vx` does not contain its `v1` element, `ops` is a list containing one tuple `(v1, v2)`**.

Explanation: The line `ops += [(v1, v2)]` appends a tuple `(v1, v2)` to the list `ops`. Given the initial state, `v1` is `len(vx) - 3` and `v2` is `len(vx) - 1`. The condition that `vx` does not contain its `v1` element remains unchanged. Therefore, `ops` now contains the tuple `(v1, v2)`.
