Output State: **`v1` is equal to `len(vx) - 3`; `v2` is equal to `len(vx) - 2`; `vx` has had its `v1` element removed.**

Explanation: The code removes the element at index `v1` from the list `vx`. Since `v1` is initially equal to `len(vx) - 2`, removing this element will reduce the length of `vx` by 1. Therefore, the new value of `v1` becomes `len(vx) - 3`. The value of `v2` remains unchanged as it was also initially equal to `len(vx) - 2`.
