Postcondition: **`ops` now either contains the tuple `(v1, v2)` as its last element or contains the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` added to its end. `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive) excluding `v1`. `v1` is an integer equal to `len(vx) - 2`. `v2` is an integer equal to `len(vx) - 2`. If `v2` is greater than 0, the last tuple in `ops` is `(v1, v2)`. If `v2` is less than or equal to 0, the last two tuples in `ops` are `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)`, where `v3` is the result of calling `q(0)` and `vx` does not contain `v3`.**
