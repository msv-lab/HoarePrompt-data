Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 3 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to len(vx) - 3 or len(vx) - 4, and `ops` is a list containing either one tuple (v1, v2) where v2 > 0 or two elements \[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)\] where v3 is the result of calling `q(0)`.
