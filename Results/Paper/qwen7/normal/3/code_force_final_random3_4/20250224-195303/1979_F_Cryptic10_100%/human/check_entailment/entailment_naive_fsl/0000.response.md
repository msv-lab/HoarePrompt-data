Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the graph is a simple path with exactly two edges removed. Specifically, consider a graph with 4 vertices where edges (1,2) and (2,3) are removed. The graph now looks like this:

```
1 - 4
 \ /
  3
```

When querying for the minimum degree vertex, the program might incorrectly proceed without identifying the correct Hamiltonian path. For instance, the first query `? 3` might return vertex 4 with a degree of 1 and vertex 3 with a degree of 1, but since vertex 3 is not connected to vertex 4, the program might incorrectly proceed to remove vertex 3, leading to an invalid path. The program needs to ensure it correctly identifies and removes vertices to maintain a valid Hamiltonian path in all scenarios.
