Output State: **`ops` will have been partially processed in reverse order, with the current tuple being the next tuple in `ops[::-1]`; `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive), `v1` is an integer equal to len(vx) - 2; `v2` is an integer equal to len(vx) - 2.**

Explanation: The code `v1, v2 = q(len(vx) - 2)` assigns the value of `len(vx) - 2` to both `v1` and `v2`. Since `vx` is a set containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive) and the input integer must be at least 3, `len(vx)` is one less than the input integer. Therefore, `len(vx) - 2` is the input integer minus 3. However, without knowing the exact input integer, we express `v1` and `v2` in terms of `len(vx) - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
