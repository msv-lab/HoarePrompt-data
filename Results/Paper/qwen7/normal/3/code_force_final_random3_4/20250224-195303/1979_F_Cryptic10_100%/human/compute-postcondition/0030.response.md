Output State: **`v1` is `len(vx) - 4`, `v2` is `len(vx) - 2`, `vx` is the list with two elements removed at indices `v1` and `v3`, `v3` is the first element returned by `q(0)`, `ops` is `[(v3, 0), (v1, 0)]`**.

Explanation: The code appends the tuples `(v3, 0)` and `(v1, 0)` to the list `ops`. The values of `v1`, `v2`, `vx`, and `v3` remain unchanged from their initial states. The list `vx` has had two elements removed at indices `v1` and `v3`, and `v3` is the first element returned by `q(0)`. The list `ops` now contains the specified tuples.
