Output State: **`vx` has at least 1 element (excluding the second last element which was moved), `v2` is now the second last element of `vx`, `v3` can be any value, `ops` is a list containing a tuple `(None, v2)`, `v1` is removed from `vx`.**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(v1, v2)` to the `ops` list. Since `v1` is removed from `vx`, it is represented as `None` in the tuple. All other variables retain their previous values, except for the addition of the tuple to `ops`.
