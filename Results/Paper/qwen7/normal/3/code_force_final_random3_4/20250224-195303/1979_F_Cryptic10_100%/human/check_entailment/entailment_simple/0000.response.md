Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires finding a Hamiltonian path in a graph where \( n \) vertices are given, and exactly \( n - 2 \) edges are removed from a complete graph. The solution uses an interactive approach to query the graph and deduce the Hamiltonian path.

2. **Analyze the Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it initializes a set `vx` containing all vertices and an empty list `ops` to store operations.
   - It enters a loop until only two vertices remain in `vx`.
     - In each iteration, it queries the graph to get the vertex with the minimum degree and its non-adjacent vertex (or 0 if no such vertex exists).
     - It removes the queried vertex from `vx` and appends the operation to `ops`.
   - After the loop, it constructs the Hamiltonian path by reversing the operations stored in `ops` and appending the remaining two vertices.
   - Finally, it prints the Hamiltonian path.

3. **Check the Logic**:
   - The logic for querying the graph and removing vertices is correct.
   - The construction of the Hamiltonian path by reversing operations and appending the remaining vertices is sound.
   - The code handles the constraints and ensures that the path is constructed within the allowed number of queries.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles the case where the remaining two vertices are adjacent (as seen in the example).
   - The code ensures that the path is constructed in a way that visits each vertex exactly once.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The code follows the problem's requirements and logic accurately.
   - It correctly constructs a Hamiltonian path using the given constraints and queries.

Correctness: **True**
