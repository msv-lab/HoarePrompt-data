Output State: **`v1` is `len(vx) - 3`; `v2` is `len(vx) - 2`; `vx` is the list with one element removed at index `v1`.**

Explanation: The code removes the element at index `v1` from the list `vx`. Initially, both `v1` and `v2` are equal to `len(vx) - 2`. After removing the element at index `v1`, the length of the list `vx` decreases by 1. Therefore, `v1` becomes `len(vx) - 3` (since one element was removed), while `v2` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the removal operation.
