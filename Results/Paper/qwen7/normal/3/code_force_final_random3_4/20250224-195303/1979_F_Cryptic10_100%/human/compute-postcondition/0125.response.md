Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `v1`, `v2`, and `ops`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `ops` contains at least one tuple.
   - Each iteration extracts the next tuple from `ops[::-1]`, where `v1` is the first element and `v2` is the second element of the tuple.

3. **Analyze the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 elements, both being the last two elements of the original `vx` before the loop started.
   - `p1` is a list of the original elements in `vx`.
   - `p2` is a list with one element `v1`.
   - `ops` must contain at least one tuple, and `v2` is part of that tuple.
   - `v1` is the first element of the next tuple in `ops[::-1]`.
   - `v2` is the second element of the next tuple in `ops[::-1]`.
   - If the last element of `p1` (which is `vx[-1]`) is equal to `v2`, then `p2` appends `v1`; otherwise, `p1` appends `v1`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `ops[::-1]`, the next tuple will be the next item in `ops[::-1]`.
   - Therefore, `v1` will be the first element of the next tuple, and `v2` will be the second element of the next tuple.
   - The condition for appending `v1` to `p2` or `p1` will depend on whether `vx[-1]` is equal to `v2`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `v1`, `v2`, and `ops`.

**State:**
- `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 elements, both being the last two elements of the original `vx` before the loop started.
- `p1` is a list of the original elements in `vx`.
- `p2` is a list with one element `v1`.
- `ops` must contain at least one tuple, and `v2` is part of that tuple.
- `v1` is the first element of the next tuple in `ops[::-1]`.
- `v2` is the second element of the next tuple in `ops[::-1]`.
- If the last element of `p1` (which is `vx[-1]`) is equal to `v2`, then `p2` appends `v1`; otherwise, `p1` appends `v1`.

State: **`vx` is a set containing exactly 2 elements, both being the last two elements of the original `vx` before the loop started; `p1` is a list of the original elements in `vx`; `p2` is a list with one element `v1`; `ops` must contain at least one tuple, and `v2` is part of that tuple; `v1` is the first element of the next tuple in `ops[::-1]`; `v2` is the second element of the next tuple in `ops[::-1]`**
