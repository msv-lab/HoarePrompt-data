Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `(v1, v2)` and the list `ops`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over the reversed version of `ops`, meaning it starts with the last tuple in `ops` and goes backwards.

3. **Determine the initial state of the loop**:
   - `vx` is a set containing exactly 2 elements, both being the last two elements of the original `vx` before the loop started.
   - `p1` is a list of the original elements in `vx`.
   - `p2` is an empty list.
   - `ops` is a list containing tuples representing all operations executed during the loop, with each tuple indicating the removal of an element from `vx` and possibly adding an operation based on the value of `v2`.
   - `v1` and `v2` are undefined.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop starts with the last tuple in `ops`, we need to ensure that `ops` is not empty. If `ops` is empty, the loop will not execute.
   - The values of `v1` and `v2` are not explicitly defined in the initial state but are part of the tuples in `ops`. We need to ensure that the loop can proceed with valid tuples.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `ops` must contain at least one tuple for the loop to execute.
- `v1` and `v2` are part of the tuples in `ops`, so they will be defined within the loop body but need to be part of a valid tuple in `ops` for the loop to start.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`vx` is a set containing exactly 2 elements, both being the last two elements of the original `vx` before the loop started; `p1` is a list of the original elements in `vx`; `p2` is an empty list; `ops` must contain at least one tuple, and `v1` and `v2` are part of that tuple.**
