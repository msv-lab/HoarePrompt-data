Output State: **`vx` has at least one element, `v2` is now the second last element of `vx`, `v3` is the first element returned by function `q(0)`, and `_` is the second element returned by function `q(0)` which is ignored.**

Explanation: The variable `v3` is assigned the first element returned by the function `q(0)`, and the second element returned by the function `q(0)` is ignored (denoted by `_`). The other variables (`vx`, `v2`, and `v1`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
