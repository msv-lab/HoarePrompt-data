Output State: The `ops` list will be empty after the loop executes all the iterations.

Explanation: The loop iterates over the `ops` list in reverse order. Each iteration of the loop checks the last element of the first tuple in the reversed list (`ops[::-1]`) against the second element of the current tuple being iterated over. If they match, it appends the first element of the current tuple to the first element of the first tuple in the reversed list. Since the loop continues to iterate over the reversed list until there are no more tuples left, eventually, the `ops` list will be fully processed and become empty.
