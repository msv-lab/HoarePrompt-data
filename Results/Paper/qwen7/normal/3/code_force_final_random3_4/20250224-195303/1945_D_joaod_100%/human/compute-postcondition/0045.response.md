Postcondition: `total` is the minimum cost between the options of passing through `b` at position `na_frente - 2` and switching to `a` at position `v - 1`. If `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, then `v` is decremented by 1 and `total` is updated to the minimum cost between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v - 1]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v - 1]` for the current value of `v - 1`. Otherwise, `v` is decremented by 1 and `total` is updated to the minimum cost between `0 + custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 2]` and `best`.
