Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `total` is 0, `cases` must be greater than 0, `na_frente` is the original value minus 2, `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `best` is set to the maximum floating-point value.
Code of the loop:
for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
    if v <= pos_final:
        if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
            best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
        total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
    else:
        total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `total` is the minimum cost between the options of passing through `b` at position `na_frente - 2` and switching to `a` at position `v`, where `v` starts from `na_frente - 2` and decrements by 1 until it reaches -1. `na_frente` is the original value minus 2 and is greater than or equal to -1. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is updated to either `0 + custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 2]` or `best`, depending on which is smaller, and `v` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `total` is updated to the minimum cost between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for the current value of `v`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `total` is the minimum cost between the options of passing through `b` at position `na_frente - 2` and switching to `a` at position `v - 1`, where `v` is the original value minus 1 and is greater than or equal to -1, and `na_frente` is the original value minus 2 and is greater than or equal to -1. If `v - 1` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is updated to either `0 + custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 2]` or `best`, and `v` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `total` is updated to the minimum cost between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v - 1]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v - 1]` for the current value of `v - 1`, and `v` is decremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `total` is the minimum cost between the options of passing through `b` at position `na_frente - 2` and switching to `a` at position `v - 1`, where `v - 1` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, and `na_frente` is the original value minus 2 and is greater than or equal to -1. If `v <= pos_final`, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, otherwise `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. If `v > pos_final`, `total` remains the same as the initial minimum cost between the two options.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
