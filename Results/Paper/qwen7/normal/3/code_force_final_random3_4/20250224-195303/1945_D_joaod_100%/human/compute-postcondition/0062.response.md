Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `total` will hold the minimum cumulative cost from the start position (`na_frente - 2`) to the end position (`-1`), considering the costs of switching to path `a` or passing through path `b` at each step. The loop iterates backward from `na_frente - 2` to `-1`, updating `total` based on the minimum cost option at each step.**

This means that `total` will contain the optimal cost path from the starting point (`na_frente - 2`) to the end point (`-1`), choosing the least costly action (either switching to `a` or passing through `b`) at each step. The loop ensures that `total` is updated to reflect the lowest possible cumulative cost by comparing the costs of switching to `a` and passing through `b` at each position.
