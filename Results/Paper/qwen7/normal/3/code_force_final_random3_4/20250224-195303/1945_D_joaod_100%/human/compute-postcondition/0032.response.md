Postcondition: `total` is the minimum cost between the scenarios where `v` is decremented from `na_frente - 2` to -1 and choosing the best path, and where `v` is incremented from `na_frente - 2` to 0, starting from the original value of `na_frente` minus 2 and ensuring `na_frente` is greater than or equal to -1. `best` keeps track of the minimum cost encountered during these processes.
