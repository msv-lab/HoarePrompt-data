Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `c` and the object `cases`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `c`**: The loop starts with `c` being set to 0 because `range(cases)` generates values from 0 to `cases-1`.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `c` is less than `cases`.

4. **Adjust the State**: Since `cases` is given as a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), the loop will execute at least once if `cases` is greater than 0. Therefore, we need to ensure that `cases` is greater than 0.

5. **State Adjustment**: We need to adjust the state of `cases` to ensure the loop can execute. Additionally, since `c` starts at 0, no adjustment is needed for `c` itself.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `cases` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cases` must be greater than 0**
