Output State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `na_frente` is the original value minus 1, `pos_final` is an input integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The value of `na_frente` is decremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `cases` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
