Output State: **`na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `v` is an input integer that can take values from `na_frente` down to 0 and is currently less than or equal to `pos_final`, `c` is 0, `pos_final` is an input integer - 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from input split and converted to integers, `total` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `best` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is now `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.**

This means that the value of `total` has been updated to include `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
