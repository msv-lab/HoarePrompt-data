Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves determining the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of the first `m` positions in a queue, where the cost of moving depends on whether he switches to a new position (`a_i`) or passes through an existing position (`b_i`).

2. **Key Components of the Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of people in front of Kirill (`na_frente`) and the maximum allowable final position (`pos_final`).
   - It then reads and stores the costs of switching and passing through each position.
   - The core logic iterates backward from the last position to the first, calculating the minimum cost to reach a position within the allowed limit.

3. **Backward Iteration Logic**:
   - The loop iterates from `na_frente` to `-1`, which is correct because it starts from the last person and moves towards the first.
   - It checks if the current position is within the allowed limit (`v <= pos_final`).
   - If within the limit, it updates the `best` cost by considering the minimum between switching to `a_v` and passing through `b_v`.
   - If outside the limit, it directly adds the appropriate cost (`a_v` or `b_v`).

4. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The logic correctly handles the transition costs and ensures that the minimum cost is tracked properly.
   - The final result is stored in `best`, which is printed at the end of each test case.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution according to the problem statement and the execution summary.
