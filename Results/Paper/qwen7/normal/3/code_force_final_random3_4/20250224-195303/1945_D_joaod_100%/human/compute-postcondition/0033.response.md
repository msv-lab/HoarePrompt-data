Postcondition: `total` is the minimum cost between the options of passing through `b` at position `na_frente - 2` and switching to `a` at position `v`, where `v` starts from `na_frente - 2` and decrements by 1 until it reaches -1. `na_frente` is the original value minus 2 and is greater than or equal to -1. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is updated to either `0 + custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 2]` or `best`, depending on which is smaller, and `v` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `total` is updated to the minimum cost between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for the current value of `v`.
