Output State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `na_frente` is an input integer, `pos_final` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `na_frente` and `pos_final`. The initial condition that `cases` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged. Therefore, `cases` is still greater than 0, while `na_frente` and `pos_final` are set to the values inputted by the user.
