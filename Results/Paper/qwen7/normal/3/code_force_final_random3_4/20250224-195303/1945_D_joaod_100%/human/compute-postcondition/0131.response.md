Output State: **`c` is 0, `v` is an input integer, `pos_final` is an input integer, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, and then converts each string to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. This list of integers is assigned to the variable `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The values of `c` and `v` remain unchanged, and `pos_final` is also unchanged.
