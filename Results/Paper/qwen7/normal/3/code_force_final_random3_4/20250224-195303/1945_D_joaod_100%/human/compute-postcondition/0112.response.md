Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `v` and `na_frente`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `v = na_frente` to `v = -1` in reverse order.

3. **Analyze the Postcondition at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `v` is `v_prev - 1`.
   - `pos_final` is an integer.
   - `total` is increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v_prev - 1]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v_prev - 1]` depending on which is smaller.
   - If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is further increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` depending on which is smaller, and `best` is updated accordingly.
   - Otherwise, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, or by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` twice if `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` is smaller.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop is running in reverse, the next value of `v` will be `v_prev - 2`.
   - `na_frente` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.
   - `pos_final` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.
   - `total` will be adjusted based on the conditions described in the postcondition. Specifically, it will be increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v_prev - 2]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v_prev - 2]` depending on which is smaller.

5. **Formulate the New State**:
   - `v` will be `v_prev - 2`.
   - `na_frente` remains the same.
   - `pos_final` remains the same.
   - `total` will be increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v_prev - 2]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v_prev - 2]` depending on which is smaller.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `v` is `v_prev - 2`, `na_frente` is the same, `pos_final` is the same, and `total` is increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v_prev - 2]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v_prev - 2]` depending on which is smaller.**
