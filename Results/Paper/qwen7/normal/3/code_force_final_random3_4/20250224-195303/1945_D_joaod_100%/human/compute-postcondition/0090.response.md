Output State: **`v` is an integer, `pos_final` is an integer, and `v` is greater than `pos_final`; `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, and the current value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than the current value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**

Explanation: The code `total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` increments the value of `total` by the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. The values of `v`, `pos_final`, and the condition that `v` is greater than `pos_final` remain unchanged. Additionally, the condition that the current value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than the current value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` also remains valid.
