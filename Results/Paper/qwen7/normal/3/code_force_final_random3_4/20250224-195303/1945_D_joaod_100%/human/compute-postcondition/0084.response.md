Output State: **`v` is an integer less than or equal to `pos_final`, `best` is equal to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, and `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**

Explanation: The code `total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]` increases the value of `total` by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. The other conditions and values remain unchanged. Therefore, `v` remains an integer less than or equal to `pos_final`, `best` remains equal to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` remains greater than or equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.
