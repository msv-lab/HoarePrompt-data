Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables and their initial states:**
   - The loop variable is `v`, which starts from `na_frente - 2` and decrements by 1 until it reaches -1.
   - `na_frente` is the original value minus 2 and is greater than or equal to -1.
   - `v` starts from `na_frente - 2`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior:**
   - If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, the loop updates `total` to the minimum cost between `0 + custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 2]` and `best`, and then decrements `v` by 1.
   - If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, the loop updates `total` to the minimum cost between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for the current value of `v`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments needed for the next iteration:**
   - The loop variable `v` will be decremented by 1 if `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.
   - If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, `v` remains unchanged.

Given the postcondition and the loop structure, let's consider the possible scenarios:

- If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`:
  - `v` will be decremented by 1.
  - `total` will be updated to the minimum cost between `0 + custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 2]` and `best`.

- If `v` is greater than `pos_final`:
  - `v` remains unchanged.
  - `total` will be updated to the minimum cost between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `v` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to consider both scenarios:

- If `v` was less than or equal to `pos_final`:
  - `v` becomes `v - 1`.
  - `total` is updated to the minimum cost between `0 + custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 2]` and `best`.

- If `v` was greater than `pos_final`:
  - `v` remains the same.
  - `total` is updated to the minimum cost between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.

However, since we need to provide a single state for the next iteration, we should consider the most general case where `v` could be either less than or equal to `pos_final` or greater than `pos_final`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: **`total` is the minimum cost between the options of passing through `b` at position `na_frente - 2` and switching to `a` at position `v - 1`, where `v` is the original value minus 1 and is greater than or equal to -1. `na_frente` is the original value minus 2 and is greater than or equal to -1. If `v - 1` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is updated to either `0 + custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 2]` or `best`, and `v` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `total` is updated to the minimum cost between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v - 1]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v - 1]` for the current value of `v - 1`.**
