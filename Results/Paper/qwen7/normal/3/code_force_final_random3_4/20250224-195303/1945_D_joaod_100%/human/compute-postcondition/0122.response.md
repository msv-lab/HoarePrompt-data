Output State: **`v` is `v_prev - 2`, `pos_final` is an integer, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[v_prev - 2]`, and `best` is updated accordingly, `total` is now `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**

Explanation: The code `total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]` increments the value of `total` by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. The other variables (`v`, `pos_final`, and `best`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The new value of `total` is the old value of `total` plus `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.
