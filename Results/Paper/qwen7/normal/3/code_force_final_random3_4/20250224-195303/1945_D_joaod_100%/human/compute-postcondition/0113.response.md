Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `v` is `v_prev - 1`
- `pos_final` is an integer
- `total` is increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v_prev - 1]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v_prev - 1]` depending on whether `custo_pra_trocar_a[v_prev - 1]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v_prev - 1]`.
- If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is further increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` depending on which is smaller, and `best` is updated accordingly. Otherwise, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, or by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` twice if `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` is smaller.

### Loop Head
The loop head is:
```python
for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
```

### Adjusting the States
1. **Variable `v`:**
   - The loop starts with `v = v_prev - 1`.
   - After the previous iteration, `v` is now `v_prev - 1`.
   - In the next iteration, `v` will be decremented by 1, so `v` will become `v_prev - 2`.

2. **Variable `na_frente`:**
   - This is the starting value of the range for the loop.
   - It does not change within the loop.

3. **Variable `pos_final`:**
   - This remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

4. **Variable `total`:**
   - The value of `total` depends on the conditions inside the loop.
   - If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` depending on which is smaller.
   - Otherwise, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, or by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` twice if `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` is smaller.
   - Since `v` is now `v_prev - 2`, we need to consider the new value of `total` based on the condition for this new `v`.

5. **Variable `best`:**
   - This variable is updated if `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.
   - Since `v` is now `v_prev - 2`, we need to check if this new `v` should update `best`.

### New State for the Next Iteration
Given the above considerations, the new state for the next iteration is:

- `v` is `v_prev - 2`
- `pos_final` remains the same
- `total` is updated based on the condition for `v = v_prev - 2`
- `best` may be updated if `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`v` is `v_prev - 2`, `pos_final` is an integer, `total` is increased by either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v_prev - 2]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v_prev - 2]` depending on whether `custo_pra_trocar_a[v_prev - 2]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v_prev - 2]`, and `best` is updated accordingly.**
