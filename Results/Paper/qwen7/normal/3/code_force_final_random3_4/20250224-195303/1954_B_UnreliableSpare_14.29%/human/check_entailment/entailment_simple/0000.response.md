### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1()` correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
   - It reads the size of the array (`n`) and the array itself (`arr`).

2. **Checking if the Array is Already Non-Beautiful**:
   - The code checks if the array is already non-beautiful by comparing adjacent elements. If any two adjacent elements are not equal, it sets `flag` to `False` and breaks out of the loop. This part is correct and ensures that if the array is already non-beautiful, `flag` will be `False`.

3. **Finding the Minimum Number of Removals**:
   - The code initializes `ans` to infinity and iterates through the array to find the longest sequence of consecutive elements that are the same.
   - It keeps track of the count of consecutive elements (`cnt`) and updates `ans` with the minimum value of `cnt` when a different element is encountered.
   - After the loop, `ans` holds the length of the longest sequence of consecutive elements that are different from the last element of the sequence.

4. **Output Determination**:
   - If `flag` is `True`, it means the array is already non-beautiful, and the output is `-1`.
   - Otherwise, the output is `ans`, which represents the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the code, the program correctly identifies whether the array is already non-beautiful or needs to be modified to achieve that state. The logic for finding the minimum number of removals is also sound.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: **True**
