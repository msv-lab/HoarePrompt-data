### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. A beautiful array can be made uniform by repeatedly replacing an element with its adjacent equal element.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` is designed to handle one test case at a time.
   - It first checks if the array is already uniform (`flag` is used for this purpose).
   - If the array is not uniform, it calculates the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break the beauty property.
   - The logic for finding the minimum removals involves counting the longest sequence of consecutive elements that are different from the most frequent element in the array.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the array is already uniform, the function correctly outputs `-1`.
   - If the array is not uniform, the function correctly identifies the longest sequence of consecutive elements that differ from the most frequent element and calculates the minimum number of removals needed.

4. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loop iterates through the array to find the longest sequence of consecutive elements that are different from the most frequent element.
   - The variable `cnt` keeps track of the current count of consecutive elements equal to `val`.
   - The variable `ans` is updated with the minimum value between its initial value and the maximum count of consecutive equal elements found in the array.

5. **Output Handling**:
   - If the array is uniform, `-1` is printed.
   - Otherwise, the length of the longest sequence of non-matching consecutive elements is printed.

6. **Constraints and Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly handles the constraints and input format as specified in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles both uniform and non-uniform arrays appropriately and outputs the correct results.

### Correctness:
**True**
