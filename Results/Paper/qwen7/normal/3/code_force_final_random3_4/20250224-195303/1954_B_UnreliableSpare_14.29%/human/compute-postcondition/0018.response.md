Output State: `flag` remains False, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than or equal to the value of `i` which will be `n-1` after the loop completes, `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), and `i` is `n-1`. The condition `arr[i] != arr[i - 1]` was found to be true at some point during the loop's execution, causing `flag` to be set to `False` and breaking out of the loop.
