Postcondition: **`flag` remains False, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), and `i` is `n-1`. If `arr[i]` equals `val`, then `cnt` is 1, `ans` is set to `Decimal('Infinity')`, and `arr[i]` is equal to `val`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to be the minimum between `ans` and `cnt`, `val` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, and `cnt` is 0.**
