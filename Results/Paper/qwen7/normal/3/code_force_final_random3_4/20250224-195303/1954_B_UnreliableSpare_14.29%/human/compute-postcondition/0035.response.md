Output State: **`flag` remains `False`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), `i` is `n`, `cnt` is increased by 1, and `ans` is updated to be the minimum between `ans` and `cnt` if `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`, `ans` is the minimum between `ans` and `cnt`.**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` to be the minimum between its current value and `cnt`. Since `cnt` is increased by 1 before this line, `ans` will now be the smaller of its original value and the new value of `cnt`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
