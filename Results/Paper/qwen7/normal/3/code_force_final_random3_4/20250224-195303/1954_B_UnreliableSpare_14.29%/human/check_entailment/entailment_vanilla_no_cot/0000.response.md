Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Function Call**: The function `func_1` is defined but never called within the main loop where the test cases are processed. Instead, the function `func_1` should be called inside the loop to handle each test case.

2. **Logic Error in Checking Beauty**: The logic to check if the array is already beautiful is flawed. The current implementation checks if all elements are the same, which is not the correct condition for the array to be beautiful. An array is beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by the specified operation.

3. **Incorrect Minimum Removal Calculation**: The logic to calculate the minimum number of removals is also incorrect. The current approach only counts consecutive occurrences of the same value and does not account for the correct operation to make the array non-beautiful.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Check if the array is already beautiful
    if len(set(arr)) == 1:
        print(-1)
        return
    
    # Find the minimum number of removals needed
    min_removals = float('inf')
    for i in range(1, n-1):
        if arr[i-1] == arr[i+1]:
            left = arr[:i]
            right = arr[i+1:]
            left_count = max(left.count(arr[i-1]), left.count(arr[i+1]))
            right_count = max(right.count(arr[i-1]), right.count(arr[i+1]))
            min_removals = min(min_removals, n - (left_count + right_count))
    
    if min_removals == float('inf'):
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(min_removals)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()
```

This corrected program properly handles each test case by checking if the array is already beautiful and calculating the minimum number of removals needed to make it non-beautiful using the specified operation.
