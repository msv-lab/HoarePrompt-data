Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. It checks if the array is beautiful by comparing adjacent elements. If any pair of adjacent elements are not equal, it sets the `flag` to `False`.
3. If the array is beautiful (`flag` remains `True`), the program prints `-1`, which is correct according to the problem statement.
4. If the array is not beautiful, the program calculates the minimum number of elements to remove by finding the length of the longest sequence of consecutive elements that are different from the most frequent element in the array.
5. The logic for finding the longest sequence of non-matching consecutive elements seems to be flawed. The current implementation counts the number of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element (`val`). This does not necessarily give the correct answer because it doesn't account for the longest sequence of non-matching elements.
6. The program uses `Decimal` from the `decimal` module, but it is not used in the actual computation, which is unnecessary and could be removed for simplicity.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
