Postcondition: `flag` remains False, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), and `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is set to `Decimal('Infinity')`, `val` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `cnt` is 0, and `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`.
