You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and the given array a is beautiful. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `flag` remains False, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than or equal to the value of `i` which will be `n-1` after the loop completes, `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), and `i` is `n-1`. The condition `arr[i] != arr[i - 1]` was found to be true at some point during the loop's execution, causing `flag` to be set to `False` and breaking out of the loop.
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    val, cnt = arr[0], 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
        
    #State: Output State: `flag` remains `False`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than or equal to the final value of `i` after the loop completes, `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq n\), and `i` is `-1` (since the loop runs from `0` to `n-1` and then `i` becomes `-1`). `cnt` is the maximum count of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `val` found during the loop, and `ans` is the minimum value of `cnt` encountered when `arr[i]` is not equal to `val`. `val` is the last element of the list `a` that was checked in the loop.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop completes, `ans` will hold the length of the longest sequence of consecutive elements in the list `a` that are different from `val`. The variable `cnt` will reflect the current count of consecutive elements equal to `val`, and `val` will be the last element of the list `a` that was compared against `val` in the loop.
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: ans (where ans is the minimum value between its initial value and the maximum count of consecutive equal elements found in the list a)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases through an array `a` of integers. For each test case, it takes an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5), and an array `a` of `n` integers (where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). It checks if the array `a` is beautiful and returns a result based on the conditions provided.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
