### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem defines a "beautiful" array as one where all elements can become the same by repeatedly performing a specific operation.
   - We need to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful, or return -1 if it's impossible.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It checks if the array is already uniform (all elements are the same). If yes, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition.

3. **Detailed Breakdown:**
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but not used in the main loop. This is a mistake.
   - The logic to determine if the array is already uniform is correct.
   - The logic to count the minimum number of removals to break the beauty condition is flawed:
     - It incorrectly assumes that the array is beautiful if all elements are the same.
     - It uses a variable `val` to track the current value and `cnt` to count consecutive occurrences.
     - However, this approach does not correctly identify the minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty condition.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to identify segments where the beauty condition can be broken.
   - We should iterate through the array and count the longest segment of consecutive identical elements.
   - The minimum number of removals needed would be the length of the array minus the length of the longest such segment.

### Corrected Code:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        max_length = 1
        current_length = 1
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if arr[i] == arr[i - 1]:
                current_length += 1
                max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
            else:
                current_length = 1
        
        if max_length == n:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(n - max_length)
```

### Conclusion:
The given code is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty condition. Therefore, the answer is:

**Correctness: **False**
