Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, the array a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and arr is a list of integers obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `arr`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the array `a` is still a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and n. The new variable `arr` now holds the same values as `a`, but as a list of integers obtained from the input.
