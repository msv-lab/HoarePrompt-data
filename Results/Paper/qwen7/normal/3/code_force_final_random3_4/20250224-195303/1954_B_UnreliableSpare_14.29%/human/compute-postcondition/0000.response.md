Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and the given array a is beautiful.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the description of the array `a` also remains the same. Therefore, the only variable updated is `n`, which is now an integer within the specified range.
