Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is the first integer input followed by a space and then the second integer `k`.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from the input using the `map(int, input().split())` function. This means that `n` and `k` are assigned the values of the first and second integers entered in a single line separated by a space. The value of `t` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it.
