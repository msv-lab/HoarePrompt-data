Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is 0, `ans` is `a[0] * (a[1] - a[0])`, `n` must be greater than 1**

Explanation: The code multiplies `ans` by the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]`. Given the initial state where `i` is 1, `ans` is `a[0]`, and `i` is incremented by 1, `i` becomes 2. Thus, `ans` is updated to `a[0] * (a[1] - a[0])`. The other variables (`k` and `n`) remain unchanged. The condition that `n` must be greater than 1 is still valid.
