Output State: **`i` is `-1`, `k` is `0`, `ans` is `a[0]`**.

Explanation: The code `ans = a[0]` assigns the first element of the list `a` to the variable `ans`. Since the initial state of `i` is `-1` and `k` is `0`, and no changes are made to these variables within the given code snippet, their values remain unchanged. The only change is that `ans` is now assigned the value of `a[0]`.
