Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the start of the loop**: 
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is the first integer input.
   - `k` is reduced by `min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`.
   - `a[i]` is `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is the first integer input.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
   - Since `i` is now 1, `a[1]` needs to be updated according to the given formula: `a[1] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[1])`.
   - `k` is reduced by `min(k, m + k // n - a[1])`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `i` is now 1.
   - `n` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `k` is reduced by `min(k, m + k // n - a[1])`.
   - `a[1]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[1])`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is reduced by min(`k`, `m + k // n - a[1]`), `a[1]` is `m + min(`k`, `m + k // n - a[1])`**
