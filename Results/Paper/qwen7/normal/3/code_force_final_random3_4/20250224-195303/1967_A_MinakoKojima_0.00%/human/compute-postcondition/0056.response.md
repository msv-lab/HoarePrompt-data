Output State: **`i` is 3, `ans` is multiplied by `a[3] - a[2]`, and `n` must be greater than 1**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by multiplying it with `a[i] - a[i - 1]`. Given that `i` was initially 2, after executing the code, `i` becomes 3. The value of `ans` is now updated to `ans * (a[3] - a[2])`. The condition that `n` must be greater than 1 remains unchanged.
