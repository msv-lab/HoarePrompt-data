Output State: **After the loop executes all 30 iterations, `i` is 29, `30` is still 30, and `s` is a list of length 30. Each element in `s` is either '1' or '0', depending on whether the corresponding bit in the binary representation of `x` (from the least significant bit to the most significant bit) is set or not.**

In more detail, the variable `i` will have the value 29 after the loop completes because the loop iterates from 0 to 29 inclusive. The variable `length` remains unchanged at 30. The list `s` will contain 30 elements, where each element corresponds to a bit in the binary representation of `x`. Specifically, `s[0]` will correspond to the least significant bit of `x`, `s[1]` to the next bit, and so on, up to `s[29]` which corresponds to the most significant bit of `x`. Each element in `s` will be '1' if the corresponding bit in `x` is set (i.e., if `x & (1 << i)` is true), and '0' otherwise.
