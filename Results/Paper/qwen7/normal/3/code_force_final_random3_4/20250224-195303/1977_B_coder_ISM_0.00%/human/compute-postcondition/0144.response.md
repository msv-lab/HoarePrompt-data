Postcondition: **`i` is between 0 and 28, `30` is 30, `s` is a list of length 30 with each element being either '1' or '0' based on the binary representation of `x`, and `flag` remains 0. If `flag` is 0, `s[i]` is '-1' and `s[i + 1]` is '1', otherwise, `s[i]` is not equal to '1' or `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`.**
