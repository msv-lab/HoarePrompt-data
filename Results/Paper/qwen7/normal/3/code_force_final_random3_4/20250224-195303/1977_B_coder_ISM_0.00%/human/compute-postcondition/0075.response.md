Output State: **`flag` is 0, `i` is 29, the characters at indices 0 to 28 of string `s` are all set to '0', and the character at index 29 of string `s` is '0'.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s[29] = '0'` changes the character at index 29 of string `s` to '0'. All other variables and the characters at indices 0 to 28 of string `s` remain unchanged.
