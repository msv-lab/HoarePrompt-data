Output State: **`flag` is 0, the character at index `i` of string `s` is '-1', and the character at index `i + 1` of string `s` is also '-1'**.

The code `s[i] = '-1'` changes the character at index `i` of string `s` from '1' to '-1'. Since the character at index `i + 1` was also '1' initially, it remains unchanged. The value of `flag` remains 0 as it was not affected by the code.
