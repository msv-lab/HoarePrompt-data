Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given code is `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `length` is 30.
   - The postcondition for `s` is based on the bitwise AND operation between `x` and \(2^i\). If the result is greater than 0, `s` contains '1'; otherwise, it contains '0'.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = 29` (inclusive).

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - The length `length` remains unchanged at 30.
   - The postcondition for `s` will now depend on the value of \(2^1\) (which is 2) and the bitwise AND operation with `x`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `length` is 30, and if the bitwise AND of `x` and \(2^1\) is greater than 0, then `s` contains '1'. Otherwise, `s` contains '0'**.
