Output State: **`flag` is 0, `i` is 29, `length` is 29, `s` remains unchanged, `nalla` is 30, `t` must be greater than 30, `x` is an input integer.**

The code `x = int(input())` assigns the value of the integer input from the user to the variable `x`. The values of the other variables (`flag`, `i`, `length`, `s`, `nalla`, and `t`) remain unchanged. The condition for `t` (it must be greater than 30) is still valid.
