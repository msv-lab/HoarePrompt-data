You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

Output

    NO
    YES
    MM

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
def func():
    os.system('cls')
    s = string.ascii_uppercase

        n = int(input())

                for j in range(n // 2):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1

                ans, x = 'AAA', 1

                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            print('YES')
            print(ans)
        
    #State: All iterations of the loop have been executed, with `t` remaining greater than 0. The value of `n` provided in each iteration will determine the content of `ans`. If `n` is 1, `ans` will be the result of doubling the character at index 0 of `s` (which is 'A'). For even `n`, `ans` will be a string where every character from `s` (up to `n // 2 - 1`) is doubled. For odd `n`, `ans` will start with 'AAA' followed by the characters from `s` (from index 1 to `n // 2 - 1`) each doubled. The variable `x` will always be set to `n // 2` after the loop completes, and `j` will be `n // 2` or `n // 2 - 1` depending on whether `n` is even or odd.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases specified by `t`. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`. If `n` is 1, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it constructs a string `ans` based on the value of `n`. If `n` is even, `ans` consists of pairs of characters from the uppercase alphabet string `s`, up to `n // 2` characters. If `n` is odd, `ans` starts with 'AAA' followed by pairs of characters from `s`, up to `n // 2 - 1` characters. After processing all test cases, it prints 'YES' and the constructed string `ans` for each valid `n`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program clears the screen using `os.system('cls')`, which is not necessary for solving the problem but does not affect correctness.
   - It initializes the string of uppercase Latin letters (`s`) and reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.

2. **Special Character Check:**
   - If `n` is 1, the program prints "NO" because a string with exactly one special character cannot be formed (since a single character has no neighbors).
   - Otherwise, the program attempts to construct a string with exactly `n` special characters.

3. **String Construction Logic:**
   - If `n` is even, the program constructs the string by repeating pairs of different characters from the alphabet until the required number of special characters is achieved.
   - If `n` is odd, the program starts with 'AAA' (which has 2 special characters) and then constructs the rest of the string similarly.

4. **Validation of Special Characters:**
   - The constructed string should have exactly `n` special characters. A character is considered special if it is different from both its neighbors.
   - However, the logic for constructing the string might not always ensure that the final string has exactly `n` special characters, especially when handling odd values of `n`.

### Testing the Program

Let's test the program with the provided examples:

#### Test Case 1: \( n = 6 \)
- Expected output: `YES\nAAABAACC`
- Actual output: `YES\nAAABAACC`

This test case seems to work correctly.

#### Test Case 2: \( n = 1 \)
- Expected output: `NO`
- Actual output: `NO`

This test case also works correctly.

#### Test Case 3: \( n = 2 \)
- Expected output: `YES\nMM`
- Actual output: `YES\nMM`

This test case works correctly as well.

### Edge Cases

1. **Odd Values of \( n \):**
   - For \( n = 3 \), the expected output should be `YES\nAAABC` or similar, but the program outputs `NO`. This indicates a flaw in the logic for handling odd values of \( n \).

2. **Large Values of \( n \):**
   - The program constructs strings up to a maximum length of 200. For very large \( n \), this might not be sufficient, but the problem constraints limit \( n \leq 50 \).

### Conclusion

After testing the program with the provided examples and considering edge cases, we find that the program fails to handle odd values of \( n \) correctly. Therefore, the program is not fully correct.
