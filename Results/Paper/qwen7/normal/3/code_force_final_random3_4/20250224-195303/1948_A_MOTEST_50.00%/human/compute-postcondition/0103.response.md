Output State: **`ans` is 'AAABBBCCC', `x` is 4, `i` is 3, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `j` is 2**

Explanation: The code `x += 1` increments the value of `x` by 1. Initially, `x` is 3, so after executing the code, `x` becomes 4. The values of `ans`, `i`, `t`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.
