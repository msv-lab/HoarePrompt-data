Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined by the `for j in range(n // 2)` statement. The variables involved in this loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `j` is 2
   - `ans` is `s[x-1] * 2 + s[x] * 2`
   - `x` is increased by 1 (so `x` is now 3)

3. **Check the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j < n // 2`.

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `j` will be 3.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `j` is now 3.
   - `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - The value of `ans` and `x` are not part of the loop head, so they remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`j` is 3, `n` must be the same as before**.
