Output State: **`j` is 2, `ans` is `s[1] * 2 + s[2] * 2 + s[2] * 2`, `x` is 3**

Explanation: The value of `x` is incremented by 1, so `x` becomes 3. The values of `j`, `ans`, and `x` are updated, but the initial value of `ans` was `s[1] * 2 + s[2] * 2`, and it was further increased by `s[2] * 2`. Therefore, the new value of `ans` is `s[1] * 2 + s[2] * 2 + s[2] * 2`. The values of `j` and `x` are updated, while `ans` reflects the additional increment.
