Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a few issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Special Characters**: The logic to generate a string with exactly `n` special characters is flawed. The current approach does not guarantee that the generated string will have exactly `n` special characters.
2. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**: For example, when `n` is odd, the current implementation does not correctly handle the placement of special characters.
3. **Output Format**: The output format should strictly follow the problem statement. The current implementation does not handle the case where `n` is 1 correctly, and it does not always produce a string of length at most 200.

### Corrected Solution:
Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
        elif n == 2:
            print('YES')
            print('AA')
        else:
            # Generate a string with exactly n special characters
            ans = 'A' * (n - 1) + 'B'
            print('YES')
            print(ans)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Solution:
1. **Handling Edge Cases**: 
   - If `n == 1`, print "NO" because it's impossible to have exactly one special character.
   - If `n == 2`, print "YES" and "AA" because both 'A' and 'A' are special characters.
2. **General Case**:
   - For `n > 2`, construct a string with `n-1` 'A's followed by a 'B'. This ensures that all 'A's are special except the last one, and the 'B' is also special.
   - This guarantees exactly `n` special characters and the string length is at most 200.

This solution adheres to the problem constraints and produces the correct output format.
