Output State: **`i` is 1 more than its previous value, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `ans` is 0, `x` is 0.**

The code assigns the value `0` to the variable `x`. The initial state of `i` remains unchanged as it is only mentioned to be 1 more than its previous value, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, and `ans` is an empty string. After executing the code, `ans` is updated to `0`, and `x` is explicitly set to `0`.
