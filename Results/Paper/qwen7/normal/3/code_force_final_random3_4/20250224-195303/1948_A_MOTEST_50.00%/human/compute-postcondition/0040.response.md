Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer. If `n` equals 1, then `t` remains greater than 0 and `n` is 1. Otherwise, `n` must be at least 2, and `t` remains greater than 0. Additionally, `ans` is a string that either contains the concatenated result of doubling the character at index `n // 2 - 1` of `s` for each iteration where `j` equals `n // 2`, or it consists of a string of 'A' repeated `n // 2 - 1` times followed by `n // 2 - 1` times the character at index `n // 2` or `n // 2 + 1` of `s`, depending on whether `n % 2 == 0` is true or false.
