Output State: **`j` is 2, `ans` is `s[x-1] * 2 + s[x] * 2`, `n` must be greater than 4**

Explanation: The code `ans += s[x] * 2` updates the value of `ans` by adding `s[x] * 2` to its current value. Since the initial state of `ans` is `s[x-1] * 2`, after executing the code, `ans` becomes `s[x-1] * 2 + s[x] * 2`. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged.
