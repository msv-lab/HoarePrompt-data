Output State: `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `ans` is the concatenation of `s[x-1] * 2` for each `x` from 0 to `n // 2 - 1`, `x` is `n // 2`.

To explain this output state in natural language:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `j` will be one less than `n // 2` because the loop increments `j` in each iteration. The variable `ans` will be a string where each character from the string `s` (from index `x-1` to `n // 2 - 1`) is repeated twice and concatenated together. The variable `x` will be equal to `n // 2` since it is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.
