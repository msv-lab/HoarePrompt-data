Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `s` is a string containing all uppercase letters from 'A' to 'Z'**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. The initial state of `n` and `s` remains unchanged. Therefore, `n` is still a positive integer within the range of 1 to 50, and `s` is still a string containing all uppercase letters from 'A' to 'Z'.
