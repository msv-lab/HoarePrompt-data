Output State: **`j` is 0, `ans` is `s[x] * 2`, `n` must be at least 2**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `ans` by adding `s[x] * 2` to its current value. However, since no initial value for `ans` is given, we assume it is initialized to 0 before this line of code. Thus, `ans` becomes `s[x] * 2`. The other variables (`j` and `n`) remain unchanged.
