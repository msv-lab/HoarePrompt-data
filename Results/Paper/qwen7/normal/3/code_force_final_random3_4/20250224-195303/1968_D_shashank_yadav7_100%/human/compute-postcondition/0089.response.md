Output State: **`k` is -2, `i` is `n - 1`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * -1 + bp`, `sm` is the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * -1 + sp`, `sp` is increased by `a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is increased by `a[b] + a[b]`, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, and `sm` is updated to the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * -1 + sp`.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is decremented by 1, changing its value from `-1` to `-2`. All other variables (`i`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`, `b`, `s`) remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
