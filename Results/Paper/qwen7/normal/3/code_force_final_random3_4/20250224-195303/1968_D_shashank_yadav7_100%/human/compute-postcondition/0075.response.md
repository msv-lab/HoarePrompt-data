Output State: **`p[s]` is decreased by 1, `k` is 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is increased by `a[s]`.**

Explanation: The variable `sp` is incremented by the value of `a[s]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
