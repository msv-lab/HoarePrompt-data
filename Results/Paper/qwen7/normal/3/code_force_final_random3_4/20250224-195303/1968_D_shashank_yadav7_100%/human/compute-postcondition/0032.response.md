Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is decreased by 1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`**

Explanation: The code `sp += a[s]` increments the value of `sp` by `a[s]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
