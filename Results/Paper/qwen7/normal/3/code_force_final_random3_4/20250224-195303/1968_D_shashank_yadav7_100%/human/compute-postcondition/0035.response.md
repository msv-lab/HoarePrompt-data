Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is 2, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp`**.

Explanation: The code `k -= 1` decreases the value of `k` by 1. Initially, `k` was decreased by 1 (though the exact value before this operation is not specified), and now it is decreased by another 1, making it 2. All other variables (`i`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`) remain unchanged from their previous values as no operations were performed on them in this code snippet.
