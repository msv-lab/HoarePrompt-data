Output State: **`p[b]` is decreased by 1, `b` is updated to reflect this change, `i` is 1, `k` is 0, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is max(`sm`, `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is increased by `a[s]`, `bp` is increased by `a[b]`**.

Explanation: The code `bp += a[b]` increases the value of `bp` by `a[b]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
