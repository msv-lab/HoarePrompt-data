Output State: **`k` is -2, `i` is `n - 1`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * -2 + bp`, `sm` is the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * -1 + sp`, `sp` is increased by `a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is increased by `a[b] + a[b]`, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 2`, and `bm` is updated to the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * -2 + bp`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` remains `-2`.
- The value of `i` remains `n - 1`.
- The value of `bm` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `a[b] * -2 + bp`. This means `bm` now holds the larger of its original value and the new value calculated from `a[b] * -2 + bp`.
- The value of `sm` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the given line of code.
- The value of `sp` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the given line of code.
- The value of `bp` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the given line of code.
- The value of `b` is updated to `p[b] - 1`.
- The value of `s` is updated to `p[s] - 2`.
- The value of `bm` is explicitly updated to the maximum value between its current value and `a[b] * -2 + bp`.
