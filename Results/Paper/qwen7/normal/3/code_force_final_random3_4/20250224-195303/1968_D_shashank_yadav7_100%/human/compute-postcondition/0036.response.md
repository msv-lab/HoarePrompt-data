Output State: **`i` is 3, `k` is 2, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is the maximum of `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is `a[s] + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + bp`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or conditional statement it is inside. Since no specific loop or conditional statement is mentioned, we assume it is breaking out of the most internal one. All the variables retain their initial values or expressions as given in the initial state.
