Output State: **`i` is `n`, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[p[...p[b]...-1]-1] - (n-1)`, `s` is `p[p[...p[s]...-1] - (n-2)`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from input, `n` is an input integer, `k` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input and converts them into a list of integers. This list is assigned to the variable `p`. The values of `i`, `k`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial state. The variable `n` remains an input integer, and `k` remains 0.
