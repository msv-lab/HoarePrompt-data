Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(n):`.
   - The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine Initial Values:**
   - From the given state, `i` is equal to `n`.
   - The value of `n` is not explicitly stated, but we know that `i` must be within the range defined by `range(n)` for the loop to execute.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `n` at the start of the loop.
   - Since `i` is initially set to `n`, the loop will not execute because `i` is not less than `n`.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - To ensure the loop executes, `i` must be less than `n` at the start.
   - Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to be less than `n`.

### Final State Adjustment:

- Adjust `i` to be less than `n` (e.g., `i = n - 1`).
- Keep `n` as it is since it is the upper limit of the range.

### Final Answer:

State: **`i` is `n - 1`, `n` remains unchanged**
