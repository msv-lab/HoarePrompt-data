Based on the initial state provided:

- `k` reaches 0, so `k = 0`.
- `i` equals `n`, so `i = n`.
- `k` is 0, so this reaffirms `k = 0`.
- `b` is defined as `p[p[...p[b]...-1]-1] - (n-1)`. Since `k = 0`, the exact value of `b` cannot be determined without knowing the structure of `p` and the initial value of `b`. However, the exact value of `b` is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- `s` is defined as `p[p[...p[s]...-1] - (n-2)`. Similar to `b`, the exact value of `s` cannot be determined without knowing the structure of `p` and the initial value of `s`. Again, the exact value of `s` is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- `bm` is the maximum value accumulated from the expression `a[b] * k + bp` during each iteration. Since `k = 0`, the expression simplifies to `a[b] * 0 + bp = bp`. Therefore, `bm` is the maximum value of `bp` during the iterations.
- `sm` is the maximum value accumulated from the expression `a[s] * k + sp` during each iteration. Similarly, since `k = 0`, the expression simplifies to `a[s] * 0 + sp = sp`. Therefore, `sm` is the maximum value of `sp` during the iterations.
- `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` for all iterations.
- `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for all iterations.
- `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`.

Given the print statement:
```
print('Draw')
```

The output will be the string 'Draw'.

Output: **Draw**
