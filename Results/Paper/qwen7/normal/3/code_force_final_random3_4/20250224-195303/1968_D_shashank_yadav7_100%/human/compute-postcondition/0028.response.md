Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is decreased by 1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `b` is assigned the value of `p[b] - 1`. Since `k` was previously decreased by 1 and the postcondition mentions that if `k` equals 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `k` is still decreased by 1 but its exact value is not specified. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was already set to 2.
