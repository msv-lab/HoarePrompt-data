Output State: **`p[b]` is decreased by 1, `b` is updated to reflect this change, `i` is 1, `k` is 0, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sm` is max(`sm`, `a[s] * k + sp`)**.

Explanation: The code updates `sm` by taking the maximum of its current value and the expression `a[s] * k + sp`. Given the initial state, `k` is 0, so the expression simplifies to `a[s] * 0 + sp`, which is just `sp`. Since `s` is defined as `p[s] - 1`, and no specific value for `p[s]` was given, `s` remains as `p[s] - 1`. The values of `i`, `b`, and `bm` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the updated expression for `sm`.
