Output State: **`k` is an input integer, `s` is `p[s] - 3`, `n` is an input integer, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * -2 + bp`, `sm` is the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * -2 + sp`, `sp` is increased by `a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is increased by `a[b] + a[b]`, `b` is `p[b] - 2`, `s` is `p[s] - 3`, `b` is decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `s -= 1` decreases the value of `s` by 1. Since `s` was originally `p[s] - 2`, after the decrement, `s` becomes `p[s] - 3`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the provided code snippet.
