Output State: **`p[b]` is decreased by 1, `k` is 0, and `i` is `n - 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `b` is used in the expression `p[b] - 1`, which means `p[b]` is decremented by 1. The value of `k` remains 0 as no operation affects it. The value of `i` stays as `n - 1` since it was not involved in the operation.
