Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The only variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State at the Start of the Loop**:
   - `i` is set to `n - 1` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - The loop will increment `i` by 1 in each iteration.

3. **Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` starts at `n - 1` and the loop increments `i` by 1, for the next iteration, `i` should be `n - 2`.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper bound of the range and does not change within the loop.

5. **Final State**:
   - `i` is now `n - 2`.
   - `n` remains the same (unchanged).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` is `n - 2`.
- `n` remains the same.

So, the final state is:
**`p[s]` is decreased by 1, `k` is 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is increased by `a[s]`, `bp` is increased by `a[b]`.**

State: **`p[s]` is decreased by 1, `k` is 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is increased by `a[s]`, `bp` is increased by `a[b]`**
