Output State: **`i` is `n`, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[p[...p[b]...-1]-1] - (n-1)`, `s` is `p[p[...p[s]...-1] - (n-2)`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is 0, `b` is `p[p[...p[b]...-1]-1] - (n-1)`, `s` is `p[p[...p[s]...-1] - (n-2)`**

Explanation: The code `n, k, b, s = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads four integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` respectively. The values of `i`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. The values of `k`, `b`, and `s` are now specific integers based on the input, while `i` retains its original value from the initial state.
