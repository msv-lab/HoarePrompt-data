Output State: **`k` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `bm` is the maximum value between `bm` and `a[b] * -2 + bp`, `sm` is the maximum value between `sm` and `a[s] * -2 + sp`, `sp` is increased by `a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is increased by `a[b] + a[b]`, `b` is `p[b] - 2`, `s` is `p[s] - 2`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer, storing the resulting list in `p`. The values of `k`, `s`, `n`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, `bp`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
