Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `x` is an input integer and `x` is greater than 0, `y` is the second integer from the input. If `x` is less than `y`, then `x` remains the same as the first integer from the input and `y` remains the second integer from the input. Otherwise, `y` is replaced by the second integer from the input.
