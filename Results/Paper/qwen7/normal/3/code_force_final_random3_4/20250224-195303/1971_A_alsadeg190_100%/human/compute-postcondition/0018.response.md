Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `i` is 2.
- `x` is the first integer from the input converted to an integer.
- `y` is the second integer from the input converted to an integer.

The `print(y, x)` statement will print the values of `y` and `x`.

Output: **[y] [x]** (where `[y]` is the second integer from the input and `[x]` is the first integer from the input)
