Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100.
- `i` is 0.
- `x` is the first integer from the input and is greater than 0.
- `y` is the second integer from the input and `x` is currently less than `y`.

The `print(x, y)` statement will print the values of `x` and `y` as they are defined in the initial state.

Output: **x, y (where x is the first integer from the input and y is the second integer from the input with x < y)**
