Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9.
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `i` is 2, `x` is the first integer from the input converted to an integer, `y` is the second integer from the input converted to an integer.
    #
    #After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `x - 1` because the loop runs from `0` to `x-1`. However, based on the provided information, we only know the state after 3 iterations, so we can only conclude that `i` is 2. The values of `x` and `y` will be the values entered in the last iteration of the loop, as the loop continuously updates these values with the new inputs. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was set initially and is not affected by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an integer `t` where `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` where `0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9`. It then prints either `(x, y)` or `(y, x)` based on whether `x` is less than `y`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any specific value but outputs pairs of integers based on the comparison condition.
