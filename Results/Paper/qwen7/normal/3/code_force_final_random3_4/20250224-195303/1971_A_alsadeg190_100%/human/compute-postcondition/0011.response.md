Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `i` is 1, `x` is the first integer from the input, `y` is the second integer from the input**.

Explanation: The code `x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes two integers as input separated by a space, converts them to integers, and assigns the first integer to `x` and the second integer to `y`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
