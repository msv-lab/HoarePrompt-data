Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates over each test case using a loop.
3. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`.
4. The program then compares `x` and `y` and prints them in ascending order.
5. This matches the requirement to output the minimum of `x` and `y` followed by the maximum of `x` and `y`.

Given the execution summary, the program behaves as expected, processing each test case and printing the correct pairs of integers.

Correctness: **True**
