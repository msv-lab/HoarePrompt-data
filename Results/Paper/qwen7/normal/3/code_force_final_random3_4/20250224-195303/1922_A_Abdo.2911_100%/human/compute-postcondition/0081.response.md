Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is `t + 1`. If the value of `a[i]` is not equal to the value of `c[i]`, then `possible` is True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out. If the value of `a[i]` is equal to the value of `c[i]`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if `c[0]` is either equal to `a[0]` or `b[0]`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop. If none of these conditions are met, `possible` is True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out.
