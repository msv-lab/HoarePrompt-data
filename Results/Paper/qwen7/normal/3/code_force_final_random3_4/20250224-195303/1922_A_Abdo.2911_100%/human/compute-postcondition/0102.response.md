Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is `t + 1`. If `c[i]` equals `a[i]` or `c[i]` equals `b[i]`, then the condition `possible` is True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If neither condition is met, the condition `possible` remains True and the most internal loop or if statement is also broken out of.
