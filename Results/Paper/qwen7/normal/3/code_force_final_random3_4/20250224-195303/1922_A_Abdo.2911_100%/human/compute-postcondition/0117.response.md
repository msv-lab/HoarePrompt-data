Output State: **`i` is `n - 1 + t`, `possible` is True if any character `c[i]` does not match either `a[i]` or `b[i]` for any `i` from 0 to `n - 1`; otherwise, `possible` is False, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string from user input.**

Explanation: The code `b = input().strip()` reads a string from the user input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace. This string is assigned to the variable `b`. The initial values of `i`, `possible`, and `a` remain unchanged. The condition for `possible` remains the same, depending on whether any character in `c` does not match either `a` or `b` at the corresponding index.
