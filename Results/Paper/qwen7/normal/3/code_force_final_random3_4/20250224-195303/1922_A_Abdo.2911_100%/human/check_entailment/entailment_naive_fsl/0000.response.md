Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where `a` and `b` match the template but `c` does not. Specifically, the program logic does not properly check if `c[i]` should be different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]` when `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different. Here's a counterexample:

For the input:
```
4
2
aa
bb
aa
```

The program should output "NO" because there is no template that makes both `a` and `b` match while making `c` not match. However, the current implementation might incorrectly output "YES" because it only checks if `c[i]` is different from `a[i]` when `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, which is not sufficient to ensure the template condition is met for all cases.
