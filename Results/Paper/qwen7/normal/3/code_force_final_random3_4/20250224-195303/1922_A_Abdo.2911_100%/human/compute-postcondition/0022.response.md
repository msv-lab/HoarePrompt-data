Output State: **`possible` is True, `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, the elements at index `i` of arrays `a` and `b` are not equal, and `c[i]` is neither equal to `a[i]` nor `b[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no explicit loop or conditional block indicated in the code snippet, the `break` statement implies that we are exiting the most internal loop or conditional structure. The values of the variables `possible`, `i`, `n`, the elements at index `i` of arrays `a` and `b`, and `c[i]` remain unchanged as per the initial state.
