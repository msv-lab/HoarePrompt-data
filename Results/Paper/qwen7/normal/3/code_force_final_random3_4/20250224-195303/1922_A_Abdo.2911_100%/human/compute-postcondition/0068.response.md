Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is `t + 1`, and the value of `a[i]` is not equal to the value of `c[i]`; `possible` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the innermost loop or conditional block without changing the values of the variables `i`, `n`, `a[i]`, `c[i]`, and `possible`. Therefore, these variables retain their original values from the initial state.
