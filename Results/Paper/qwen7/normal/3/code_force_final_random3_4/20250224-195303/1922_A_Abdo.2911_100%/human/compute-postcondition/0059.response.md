Output State: **`possible` is either True or False, `t` is `k - 1`, `a` is the input string after stripping whitespace.**

Explanation: The code `a = input().strip()` takes an input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace from the input, and assigns it to the variable `a`. The values of `possible` and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.
