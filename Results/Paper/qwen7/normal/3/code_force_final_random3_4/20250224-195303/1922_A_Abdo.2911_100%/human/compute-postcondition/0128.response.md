Postcondition: `i` is `n - 1 + t`, `n` must be greater than 0, `possible` is False, `c` is an input string from user input, and if `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, then the current value of `a[i]` is not equal to the current value of `b[i]` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of; otherwise, the current value of `a[i]` remains equal to the current value of `b[i]`.
