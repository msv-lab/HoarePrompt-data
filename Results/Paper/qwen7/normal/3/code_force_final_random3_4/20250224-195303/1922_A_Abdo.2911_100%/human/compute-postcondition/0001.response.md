State: **`t` must be an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, _ is not relevant as it is a dummy variable**.

Explanation:
- The loop variable `_` is a dummy variable used for iteration and does not affect the loop's execution condition.
- The variable `t` is crucial because the loop runs `t` times. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a valid integer within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). Any other state or variable not mentioned in the loop head does not affect the loop's execution condition.
