You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to check if there exists a template `t` such that both `a` and `b` match it, but `c` does not.
   - A template `t` is a string where each character is either lowercase or uppercase.
   - If a character in `t` is lowercase, the corresponding character in `a` or `b` must match it.
   - If a character in `t` is uppercase, the corresponding character in `a` or `b` must be different from the lowercase version of that character.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n`, and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - It initializes a boolean variable `possible` to `False`.
   - It iterates through each character of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` up to length `n`.
     - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same and different from `c[i]`, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
     - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different and `c[i]` matches either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, it continues to the next iteration.
     - If none of the above conditions are met, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
   - After the loop, it prints "YES" if `possible` is `True`, otherwise it prints "NO".

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic checks if there is any position where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same and different from `c[i]`. This ensures that `a` and `b` can match the template, but `c` cannot.
   - The program handles all the conditions correctly as per the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match it, but `c` does not.
