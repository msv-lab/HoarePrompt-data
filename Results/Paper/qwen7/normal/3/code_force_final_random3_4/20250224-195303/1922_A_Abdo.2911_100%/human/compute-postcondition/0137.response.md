Output State: **`i` is `n - 1 + t`, `possible` is `True`, `c` is an input string from user input, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block specified in the code snippet, the `break` statement indicates that we are breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. The values of the other variables (`i`, `possible`, and `c`) remain unchanged.
