Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is a positive integer

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop starts with `i = 0`.
   - After the first iteration (which is the previous iteration), `i` is incremented by 1, making it `i = 1`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented again, making it `i = 2`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `i < n`.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `2`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is a loop variable and does not change within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer**
