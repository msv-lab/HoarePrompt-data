Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is `t + 1`.
   - Either `c[1]` equals `a[1]` or `b[1]`, or `possible` is True and we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.

3. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since the loop is defined as `for i in range(n)`, the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 1 and `n` is `t + 1`, the loop will execute again because `1 < t + 1` is true.
   - After the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making it `i = 2`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be updated to 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body (it is determined by the initial condition `n = t + 1`).

5. **Consider the Postcondition**:
   - The postcondition states that either `c[1]` equals `a[1]` or `b[1]`, or `possible` is True and we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - This postcondition does not change based on the loop iteration itself but rather on the loop body, which is omitted in this context.

Therefore, the only states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is `t + 1`**.
