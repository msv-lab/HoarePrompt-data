Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is `n - 1 + t`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `possible` is `True` if for every index `j` from `0` to `n-1`, `c[j]` is either equal to `a[j]` or `b[j]`. Otherwise, `possible` is `False`. The variable `c` remains as the input string from user input.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `possible` will be `True` only if the character at each index `j` in the string `c` matches either the character at the same index in string `a` or string `b`. If there is even one index where `c[j]` does not match either `a[j]` or `b[j]`, then `possible` will be `False`. The variable `i` will end up being `n - 1 + t`, and it does not affect the final value of `possible`.
