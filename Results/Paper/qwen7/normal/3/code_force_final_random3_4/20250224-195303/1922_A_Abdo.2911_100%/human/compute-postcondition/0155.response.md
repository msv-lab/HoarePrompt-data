Output State: **`i` is `n + t + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `possible` is `True`**.

Explanation: The code sets `possible` to `True`. Since the initial state of `possible` was determined by the condition involving `c[i+1]`, `a[i+1]`, and `b[i+1]`, setting `possible` to `True` directly updates its value without changing the conditions that led to its initial state. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
