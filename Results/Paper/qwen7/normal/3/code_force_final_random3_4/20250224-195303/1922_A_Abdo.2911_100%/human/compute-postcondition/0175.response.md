Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` (each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters). For each test case, it checks if it's possible to transform string `c` into either string `a` or `b` by changing exactly one character at the same position. If such a transformation is possible, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
