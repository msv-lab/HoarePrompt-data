Output State: **`possible` is True, `i` is 1, `n` is `t + 1`**

Explanation: The code `possible = True` simply assigns the value `True` to the variable `possible`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `possible` and retains the original values of `i` and `n`.
