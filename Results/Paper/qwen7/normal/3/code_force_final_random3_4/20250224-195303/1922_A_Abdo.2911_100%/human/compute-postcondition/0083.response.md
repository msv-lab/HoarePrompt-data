Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is `t + 1`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(n)`, meaning it will iterate from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - If `a[i]` is not equal to `c[i]`, then `possible` is set to `True` and the loop is broken out.
   - If `a[i]` is equal to `c[i]`, the loop continues to the next iteration.
   - If `c[0]` is either equal to `a[0]` or `b[0]`, the loop continues to the next iteration.
   - Otherwise, `possible` is set to `True` and the loop is broken out.

4. **Current Values:**
   - Since `i` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration, the loop has just checked `a[0]` and `c[0]`.
   - If `a[0]` was not equal to `c[0]`, `possible` would be `True` and the loop would be broken out.
   - If `a[0]` was equal to `c[0]`, the loop would continue to the next iteration (which means `i` would become 1).
   - If `c[0]` was either equal to `a[0]` or `b[0]`, the loop would continue to the next iteration (which means `i` would become 1).

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1.
   - `n` remains the same, which is `t + 1`.

6. **Adjusting the State:**
   - The only variable that changes in the loop head is `i`.
   - Therefore, we need to update `i` to 1.

**Final State:**
- `i` is 1
- `n` is still `t + 1`

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is `t + 1`**
