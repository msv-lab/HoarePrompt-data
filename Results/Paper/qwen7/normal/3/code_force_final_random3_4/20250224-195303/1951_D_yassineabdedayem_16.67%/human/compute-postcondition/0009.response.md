Postcondition: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` must be non-zero, `k` must be greater than 0, `rep` is 0, `number` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`. The current value of `Max` is equal to `k` and the product of `n` and `Min` is less than or equal to `k`.
