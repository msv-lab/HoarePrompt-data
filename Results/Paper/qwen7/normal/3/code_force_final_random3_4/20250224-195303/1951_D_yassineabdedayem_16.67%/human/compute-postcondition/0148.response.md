Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is the last element in the list `tab`, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` must be greater than 0, `rep` must be less than 60, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `min(n // k, k)**.

Explanation: The line `number = Min` assigns the value of `Min` to the variable `number`. Since `Min` is defined as `min(n // k, k)`, `number` is now equal to `min(n // k, k)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
