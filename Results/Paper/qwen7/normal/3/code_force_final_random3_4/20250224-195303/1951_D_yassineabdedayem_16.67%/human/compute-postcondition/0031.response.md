Output State: **`rep` is 2, `k` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`**

Explanation: The code assigns `Min` and `Max` based on the values of `n` and `k`. Since `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` must be greater than 0, `n // k` and `int(n / k)` will yield the same result when `n` is divisible by `k` without a remainder. Otherwise, `n // k` will be the floor division, and `int(n / k)` will be the division result rounded towards zero. `Min` will take the smaller value between `n // k` and `k`, and `Max` will take the larger value between `int(n / k)` and `k`. The initial conditions for `rep`, `k`, and `n` remain unchanged.
