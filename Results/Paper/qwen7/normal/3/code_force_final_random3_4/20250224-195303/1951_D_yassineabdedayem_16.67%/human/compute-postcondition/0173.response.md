Output State: **All variables outside the loop, such as `t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `number`, `tab`, `Min`, and `Max`, will retain their values from the final iteration. Specifically, `t` will be the initial value, `n` will be 0, `k` will be 0, `rep` will be 60, `number` will be 0, `tab` will be an empty list, `Min` will be 0, and `Max` will be 0.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `number`, `tab`, `Min`, and `Max` will reflect the state they are in after the last iteration of the loop. The variable `t` retains its initial value because it is not modified within the loop. The variable `n` becomes 0 after the loop ends, indicating that the division process has completed. `k` also becomes 0, showing that the subtraction process has completed. `rep` remains at 60 since the loop runs up to 60 iterations. `number`, `tab`, `Min`, and `Max` are all reset to 0 or empty states as per the loop's final conditions.
