Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
   - `n` is defined as `n - Min * Max * 59`. Since `Min` and `Max` are not explicitly defined yet, we need to consider their values later.
   - `k` is defined as `k - 59 * (min(n // k, k))`. Given that `k` is initially 0, this expression simplifies to `k = 0 - 59 * (min(n // 0, 0))`. Since division by zero is undefined, this part of the expression does not affect `k` directly because `k` is already 0.
   - `rep` is 60.
   - `number` is defined as `max(int(n / k), k)`. Since `k` is 0, `int(n / 0)` is undefined, but we can infer that `max(int(n / 0), 0)` will be 0 because any non-zero value divided by zero would result in an undefined value, and `max` of that with 0 will be 0.
   - `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` repeated 60 times. Since `number` is 0, `tab` will be a list of 60 zeros: `['0', '0', ..., '0']` (60 times).
   - `Min` is defined as `min(n // k, k)`. Again, since `k` is 0, `min(n // 0, 0)` will be 0.
   - `Max` is defined as `max(int(n / k), k)`. As previously determined, this will also be 0.
   - `k` remains 0 after all operations.

2. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is simply `print('YES')`.

Given the above analysis, the print statement will output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
