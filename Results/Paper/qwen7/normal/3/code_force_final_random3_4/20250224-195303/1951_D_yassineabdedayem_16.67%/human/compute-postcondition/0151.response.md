Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is the last element in the list `tab`, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is `k - Min`, `rep` must be less than 60, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `number` is `max(int(n / k), k)**.

Explanation: The code `k = k - Min` updates the value of `k` by subtracting `Min` from it. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. `Min` is defined as `min(n // k, k)`, which means it is the minimum between `n // k` and `k`. The values of `total`, `i`, `n`, `rep`, `Max`, and `number` remain as per the initial state.
