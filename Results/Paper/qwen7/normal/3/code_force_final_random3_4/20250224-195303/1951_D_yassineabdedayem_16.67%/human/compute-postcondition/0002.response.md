Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive; `n` is an integer read from input; `k` is an integer read from input.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from standard input using `stdin.readline().split()` and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
