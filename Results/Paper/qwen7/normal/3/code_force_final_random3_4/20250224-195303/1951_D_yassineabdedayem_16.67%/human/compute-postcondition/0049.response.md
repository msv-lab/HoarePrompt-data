Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is 0.
- `rep` is 60.
- `number` is non-zero.
- `i` is the first element of `tab`.
- `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` repeated 59 times.

The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the first element of the list `tab`.

Since `tab` is a list with the string representation of `number` repeated 59 times, the first element of `tab` is the string representation of `number`.

Therefore, the output will be the string representation of `number`.

Output: **the string representation of number**
