Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `i` as the variable that iterates over the list `tab`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in the list `tab` to iterate over.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `total` is 0
   - `i` is the last element in the list `tab`
   - `n` is 0
   - `k` is 0
   - `rep` is 60
   - `Min` is 0
   - `Max` is 0
   - `number` is 0
   - `tab` is a list that must have at least one element

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently the last element in `tab`, for the loop to continue, `tab` must have at least one more element after `i`.
   - Therefore, `i` will be set to the second-to-last element in `tab` (the new last element after removing the current last element).
   - The length of `tab` will decrease by one.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `total` remains 0
- `i` becomes the second-to-last element in `tab`
- `n` remains 0
- `k` remains 0
- `rep` remains 60
- `Min` remains 0
- `Max` remains 0
- `number` remains 0
- `tab` must now have at least one more element than it did at the end of the previous iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`total` is 0, `i` is the second-to-last element in the list `tab`, `n` is 0, `k` is 0, `rep` is 60, `Min` is 0, `Max` is 0, `number` is 0, `tab` is a list that must have at least two elements**
