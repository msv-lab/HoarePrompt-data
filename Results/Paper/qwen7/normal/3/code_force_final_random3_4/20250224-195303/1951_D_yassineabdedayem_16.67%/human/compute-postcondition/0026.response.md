Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` must be greater than 0 and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is decreased by either `Max` (if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`) or `Min` (otherwise), `rep` is 1, `number` is either `Min` or `max(int(n / k), k)`, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, and `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`**.
