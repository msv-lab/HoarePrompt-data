Let's break down the loop condition and the current state to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Loop Condition
The loop continues as long as:
- `n != 0`
- `k > 0`
- `rep < 60`
- `n >= k`

### Current State
- `total` is 0
- `i` is the last element in the list `tab`
- `n` is `n - Min * Max`
- `number` is either `min(n // k, k)` or `max(int(n / k), k)`
- `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`
- `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`
- `Max` is adjusted based on whether `n * Min <= k` or not:
  - If `n * Min <= k`, then `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k) - k`
  - Otherwise, `Max` is `k - min(n // k, k)`
- `rep` is `rep + 1`

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The loop will continue if `n != 0`, `k > 0`, `rep < 60`, and `n >= k`.
   
2. **Current Values**:
   - `n` is `n - Min * Max`
   - `rep` is `rep + 1`
   - We need to ensure these values meet the loop conditions for the next iteration.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - **`n`**: Since `n` is used in the condition `n >= k`, we need to ensure `n` is non-zero and greater than or equal to `k` for the next iteration.
   - **`k`**: `k` should remain positive (`k > 0`).
   - **`rep`**: `rep` should be less than 60 (`rep < 60`).

### Conclusion
To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust the following states:
- Ensure `n` is non-zero and greater than or equal to `k`.
- Ensure `k` remains positive.
- Ensure `rep` is less than 60.

Given the current state, we can infer that `n` was previously adjusted by `n - Min * Max`, and `rep` was incremented by 1. Therefore, we need to ensure these adjustments maintain the loop conditions.

### Final Answer
State: **`total` is 0, `i` is the last element in the list `tab`, `n` must be non-zero and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` must be greater than 0, `rep` must be less than 60**
