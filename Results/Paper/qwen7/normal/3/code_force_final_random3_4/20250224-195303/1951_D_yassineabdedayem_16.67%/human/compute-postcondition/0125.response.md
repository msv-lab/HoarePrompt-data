Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is the last element in the list `tab`, `n` must be greater than 0 and greater than or equal to `k`, `number` is `min(n // k, k)`, `tab` is an empty list, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k) - k`, and the current value of `Max` is `k - k` and the current value of `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `k` is updated to `k - Max`. Given that the current value of `Max` is `k`, the new value of `k` becomes `k - k`, which is `0`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
