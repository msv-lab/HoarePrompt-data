Output State: **`rep` is 1, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is either `k - Max` or `k - Min`, `Min` and `Max` are recalculated based on the new value of `k`, and `number` is added to the list `tab` as a string.**

Explanation: The code `n -= Min * Max` subtracts the product of `Min` and `Max` from `n`. The values of `rep`, `k`, `Min`, `Max`, and the action of adding `number` to `tab` as a string remain unchanged. Therefore, `rep` stays as 1, `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`, `k` remains either `k - Max` or `k - Min`, `Min` and `Max` are recalculated based on the new value of `k`, and `number` continues to be added to `tab` as a string.
