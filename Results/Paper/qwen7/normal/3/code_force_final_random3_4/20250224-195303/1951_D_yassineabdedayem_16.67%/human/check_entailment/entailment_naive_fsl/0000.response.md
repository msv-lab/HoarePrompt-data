Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the greedy behavior of Alice buying jewels from the stalls. Specifically, the logic for determining how many jewels Alice buys from each stall is flawed. The program attempts to minimize the number of stalls used by always choosing the maximum possible number of jewels that can be bought from each stall, which does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.

For example, consider the following case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  10 5
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  YES
  5
  2 2 2 2 2
  ```

However, the program might output:
```
NO
```

This happens because the program's logic does not correctly handle the scenario where Alice needs to buy exactly `k` jewels by using the minimum number of stalls. Instead, it tries to minimize the number of stalls by always buying the maximum number of jewels possible from each stall, which may result in Alice buying more or fewer than `k` jewels.

To correctly solve this problem, Bob needs to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by carefully setting the prices of the stalls. The program should dynamically adjust the prices to achieve the desired outcome, rather than simply minimizing the number of stalls.
