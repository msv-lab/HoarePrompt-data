Output State: **`rep` is 0, `k` is a non-zero value, `i` is the last element in the list `tab`, `n` is an integer read from standard input, `k` is an integer read from standard input**.

The code simply reassigns the value of `rep` to 0, which does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `k`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged, and `rep` is explicitly set to 0.
