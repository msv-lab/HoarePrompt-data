Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
   - `n` is defined as `n - Min * Max * 59`.
   - `k` is defined as `k - 59 * (min(n // k, k))`.
   - `rep` is 60.
   - `number` is `max(int(n / k), k)`.
   - `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` repeated 60 times.
   - `Min` is `min(n // k, k)` for the final iteration.
   - `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)` for the final iteration.
   - `k` is 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(len(tab))
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - Since `k` is set to 0, the expressions involving `k` will lead to undefined behavior or errors because division by zero is not allowed. However, let's assume the code is designed to handle this scenario gracefully, possibly setting `n` to a value that avoids division by zero.
   - Given `k = 0`, the expression `min(n // k, k)` and `max(int(n / k), k)` would involve division by zero, which is undefined. For practical purposes, let's assume these expressions are handled such that they do not cause an error and result in a meaningful value.
   - The value of `number` is derived from `max(int(n / k), k)`. Since `k` is 0, `int(n / k)` is undefined, but if we assume a practical handling, it might default to a large number or a specific value to avoid errors.
   - `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` repeated 60 times. If `number` is a large number or a specific value, `tab` will contain that many repetitions.
   - The length of `tab` will be 60, regardless of the actual value of `number`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The length of `tab` is 60, as it contains the string representation of `number` repeated 60 times.
   
Output: **60**
