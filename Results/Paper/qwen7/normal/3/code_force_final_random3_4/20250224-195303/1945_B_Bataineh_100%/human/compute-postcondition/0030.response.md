Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(t)`.
   - The variable `i` is being incremented within the loop.
   - The variable `t` is the upper limit for the loop.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers assigned from the input.

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `t`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, if `i` is to be incremented to 2 (the next value), `i` must be 2.
   - Therefore, `i` should be set to 2.
   - `t` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the loop and does not change within the loop itself.
   - `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head and their values are determined by the input.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `t` must still be greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\).
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `a`, `b`, and `m` remain as integers assigned from the input.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers assigned from the input.**
