Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers entered by the user.**

The code `a, b, m = map(int, input().split())` reads three space-separated integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m`. The initial state of `t` and `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, `t` must still be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, and `i` is still 2. The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are the integers entered by the user.
