You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, a, b, and m are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^{18}.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        if m < a and m < b:
            print(2)
        elif m < a and m > b:
            print(2 + m // b)
        elif m < b and m > a:
            print(2 + m // a)
        else:
            print(m // a + m // b + 2)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `t` will still be an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and it will hold the final value it was set to during the last iteration of the loop. The variable `i` will be equal to `t - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The variables `a`, `b`, and `m` will be the values read from the input during the last iteration of the loop. Depending on the conditions met within the last iteration's if-else block, the output will be either 2, 2 + `m` // `b`, 2 + `m` // `a`, or `m` // `a` + `m` // `b` + 2. All other variables and their states will remain unchanged from their initial or previous iteration states.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes three integers t, a, and m for each test case, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, a, b, and m are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^{18}. It returns a result based on the values of a, b, and m for each of the t test cases.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
