Output State: **`arr[i]` is an integer, and `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0; `mex` is a list containing the value abs(`arr[i]` - `minn`).**

Explanation: The code appends to the `mex` list the absolute difference between the current value of `arr[i]` (which is an integer less than or equal to 0) and `minn` (the minimum value found in `arr` up to this point). The initial conditions of `arr[i]` being an integer and less than or equal to 0 remain unchanged. The `mex` list now contains one additional element, which is the calculated absolute difference.
