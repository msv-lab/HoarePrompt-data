Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `itm` which is iterating over the list `mex`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements left in the list `mex`. At the end of the previous iteration, `itm` was set to the first element of `mex`.

3. **Determine the next state**: For the loop to execute one more time, `itm` must be set to the next element in the list `mex`. Since `itm` was the first element in the previous iteration, it will now be the second element.

4. **Adjust the state**: The only variable in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `itm`. Therefore, `itm` should be set to the second element of `mex`.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`mex` is a list containing all the values of `minn` updated during each iteration where `arr[i] > 0`, and the absolute differences between `arr[i]` and `minn` when `arr[i] <= 0`, `itm` is the second element of `mex`**
