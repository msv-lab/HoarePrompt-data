Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to reconstruct a permutation \( p \) from the given array \( a \). The value of \( a_i \) is defined as the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) of the prefix \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i \) minus \( p_i \).

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size \( n \) and the array \( a \).
   - It initializes `minn` and `maxx` to keep track of the smallest and largest values seen so far.
   - The loop iterates through the array \( a \):
     - If \( a_i > 0 \), it means the next value in the permutation \( p \) should be the current `minn`, and then increments `minn`.
     - If \( a_i \leq 0 \), it calculates the MEX value and updates `maxx` if necessary.
   - After processing the array, it prints the reconstructed permutation \( p \).

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic for constructing \( p \) seems to align with the definition of MEX. Specifically, when \( a_i > 0 \), the next value in \( p \) should be the smallest unused value (`minn`), which ensures the MEX calculation is correct.
   - When \( a_i \leq 0 \), the code correctly adjusts the MEX value and updates `maxx` to ensure the next value in \( p \) is correctly chosen.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles both positive and negative values in \( a \) appropriately.
   - The code ensures that each value from 0 to \( n-1 \) is used exactly once in the permutation \( p \).

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
