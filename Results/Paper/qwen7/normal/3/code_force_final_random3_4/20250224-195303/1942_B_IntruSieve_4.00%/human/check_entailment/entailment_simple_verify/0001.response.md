### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to reconstruct a permutation \( p \) from the given array \( a \). The value of \( a_i \) is defined as the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) of the prefix \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i \) minus \( p_i \).

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size \( n \) and the array \( a \).
   - It initializes `minn` and `maxx` to keep track of the smallest and largest values seen so far.
   - The loop iterates through the array \( a \):
     - If \( a_i > 0 \), it means the next value in the permutation \( p \) should be the current `minn`, and then increments `minn`.
     - If \( a_i \leq 0 \), it calculates the MEX value and updates `maxx` if necessary.
   - After processing the array, it prints the reconstructed permutation \( p \).

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic for constructing \( p \) seems to align with the definition of MEX. Specifically, when \( a_i > 0 \), the next value in \( p \) should be the smallest unused value (`minn`), which ensures the MEX calculation is correct.
   - However, there is a critical flaw in the logic for handling \( a_i \leq 0 \). The code calculates the MEX value but does not use this value directly in the permutation construction. Instead, it appends the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` to the `mex` list, which is not the correct approach.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle the case where the MEX value needs to be used directly in the permutation construction. For example, if \( a_i = -1 \), the MEX value should be 0, but the code appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex`, which is not the correct MEX value.
   - The code also does not ensure that each value from 0 to \( n-1 \) is used exactly once in the permutation \( p \).

Given the analysis, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The logic for handling \( a_i \leq 0 \) is flawed, and the code does not ensure that each value from 0 to \( n-1 \) is used exactly once in the permutation \( p \).

### Final Evaluation:
