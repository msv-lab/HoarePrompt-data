Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `mex` is a list containing all the values of `minn` updated during each iteration where `arr[i] > 0`, and the absolute differences between `arr[i]` and `minn` when `arr[i] <= 0`. The final value of `itm` is the last element of `mex`, and `maxx` is the maximum value among all the absolute differences calculated during the loop.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `mex` will contain every value that `minn` was updated to during the iterations, along with the absolute differences between `arr[i]` and `minn` when `arr[i]` is less than or equal to zero. The variable `itm` will hold the last element printed by the loop, which is the last element of the `mex` list. Additionally, `maxx` will store the highest absolute difference found during the entire process.
