Output State: **`arr[i]` is greater than 0; `minn` is increased by 1; `mex` contains the current minimum value of `minn`.**

Explanation: The value of `minn` is incremented by 1, but the exact value of `minn` before the increment is not specified. However, since `mex` is defined as the current minimum value of `minn`, and `minn` has just been incremented, `mex` will also reflect this new value of `minn`. The conditions for `arr[i]` and the initial definition of `mex` remain unchanged.
