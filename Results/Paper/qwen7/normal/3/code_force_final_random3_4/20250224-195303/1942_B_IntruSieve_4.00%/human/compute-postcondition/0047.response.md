Output State: **After all iterations, `mex` will be a list containing all the values of `minn` updated during each iteration where `arr[i] > 0`, and the absolute differences between `arr[i]` and `minn` when `arr[i] <= 0`. The final value of `minn` will be the last updated value of `minn` after the loop completes, and `maxx` will be the maximum value among all the absolute differences calculated during the loop.**

This means that `mex` will contain all the values that `minn` took on when `arr[i]` was positive, and for each negative `arr[i]`, `mex` will include the difference between `arr[i]` and the current `minn`. The final `minn` will be the last value it was updated to, and `maxx` will hold the highest absolute difference encountered between `arr[i]` and `minn` whenever `arr[i]` was positive.
