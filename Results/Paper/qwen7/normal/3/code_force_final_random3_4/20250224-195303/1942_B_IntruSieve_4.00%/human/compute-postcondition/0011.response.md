Output State: **`arr[i]` is greater than 0; `minn` is equal to `maxx` + 1; `mex` contains the current minimum value of `minn`.**

Explanation: The code `minn = maxx + 1` updates the value of `minn` to be `maxx + 1`. The other variables (`arr[i]`, `maxx`, and `mex`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
