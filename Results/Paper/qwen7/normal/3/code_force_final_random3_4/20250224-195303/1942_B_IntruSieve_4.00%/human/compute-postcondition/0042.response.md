Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` remains the same, `minn` and `mex` are updated based on the value of `arr[i + 1]`, `maxx` is the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`.**

Explanation: The code updates `maxx` to be the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`. The values of `i`, `n`, `minn`, `mex`, and `arr` are updated based on the conditions given, but the specific values are not provided. Therefore, we keep the general form of the variables as described.
