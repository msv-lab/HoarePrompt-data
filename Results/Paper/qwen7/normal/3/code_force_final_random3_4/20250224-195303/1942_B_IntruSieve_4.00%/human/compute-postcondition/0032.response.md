Postcondition: `i` is `i + 1`, `n` remains the same, `minn` and `mex` are updated based on the value of `arr[i + 1]`, and `mex` is appended with the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn`. If the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` is greater than `maxx`, then `maxx` is updated to this new value. Otherwise, `maxx` remains unchanged.
