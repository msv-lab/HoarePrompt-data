### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code to understand its behavior and correctness.

#### Key Points from the Annotated Code:
1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Main Function (`func_1`)**:
   - Reads the size of the permutation `n`.
   - Reads the array `arr` of length `n`.
   - Initializes `mex` as an empty list, `minn` as 0, and `maxx` as 0.
   - Iterates through the array `arr`:
     - If `arr[i] > 0`, it appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`. If `minn` equals `maxx`, it resets `minn` to `maxx + 1`.
     - If `arr[i] <= 0`, it appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex` and updates `maxx` if necessary.
   - Prints the elements of `mex`.

#### Analysis of the Logic:
1. **Initialization and Setup**:
   - The program initializes `minn` to 0 and `maxx` to 0. This means that initially, the smallest unused number is 0.
   
2. **Processing Positive Values**:
   - When `arr[i] > 0`, the program appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`. This ensures that the first positive value in `mex` is the smallest unused number.
   - If `minn` equals `maxx`, it resets `minn` to `maxx + 1`. This step is unnecessary because `minn` will always be incremented before it can equal `maxx`.

3. **Processing Negative Values**:
   - When `arr[i] <= 0`, the program appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex`. This means that if `arr[i]` is negative, the program calculates the difference between `arr[i]` and the current smallest unused number (`minn`) and appends the absolute value of this difference to `mex`.

4. **Final Output**:
   - The program prints the elements of `mex`, which are supposed to represent the MEX values for the corresponding positions in the permutation.

#### Correctness Analysis:
- The program does not correctly compute the MEX values and assign them to the permutation \( p \). Specifically, the logic for handling negative values in `arr` is flawed. The program does not ensure that the MEX values are correctly assigned to the permutation \( p \).

#### Example Revisited:
Let's revisit the example provided in the original assessment:

- **Input**:
  ```
  3
  5
  1 1 -2 1 2
  ```

- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  0 1 4 2 3
  ```

- **Program Output**:
  ```
  0 1 3 2 4
  ```

- **Analysis**:
  - **First Element**: \( a_1 = 1 \)
    - MEX of \(\emptyset\) is 0, so \( p_1 = 0 \).
    - Program correctly assigns \( p_1 = 0 \).
  - **Second Element**: \( a_2 = 1 \)
    - MEX of \([0]\) is 1, so \( p_2 = 1 \).
    - Program correctly assigns \( p_2 = 1 \).
  - **Third Element**: \( a_3 = -2 \)
    - MEX of \([0, 1]\) is 2, so \( p_3 \) should be 4 (since \( 2 - 2 = 0 \), but 0 is already used, so we take the next available number which is 4).
    - Program incorrectly assigns \( p_3 = 3 \).
  - **Fourth Element**: \( a_4 = 1 \)
    - MEX of \([0, 1, 4]\) is 2, so \( p_4 = 2 \).
    - Program correctly assigns \( p_4 = 2 \).
  - **Fifth Element**: \( a_5 = 2 \)
    - MEX of \([0, 1, 4, 2]\) is 3, so \( p_5 = 3 \).
    - Program correctly assigns \( p_5 = 3 \).

From the above analysis, it is clear that the program does not correctly compute the MEX values and assign them to the permutation \( p \). Specifically, the assignment of \( p_3 \) is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly generate a permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \).

**Final: False**
