Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is the same, `minn` and `mex` are updated such that `mex` now contains the value of `minn`.**

Explanation: The code appends the current value of `minn` to the list `mex`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. The variable `minn` is used to determine what value is appended to `mex`, and `mex` is updated accordingly.
