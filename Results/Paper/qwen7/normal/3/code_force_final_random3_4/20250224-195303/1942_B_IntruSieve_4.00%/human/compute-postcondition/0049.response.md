To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `mex` is a list containing all the values of `minn` updated during each iteration where `arr[i] > 0`.
   - `itm` is the first element of `mex`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(itm, end=' ')`.

Given this information, we need to understand what `itm` represents. According to the initial state, `itm` is the first element of the list `mex`. 

Since `mex` is constructed by updating `minn` during iterations where `arr[i] > 0`, and `itm` is simply the first element of `mex`, `itm` will be the first value of `minn` that was updated under the condition `arr[i] > 0`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the first value of `minn` that was updated when `arr[i] > 0`.

Output: **itm (where itm is the first value of minn that was updated when arr[i] > 0)**
