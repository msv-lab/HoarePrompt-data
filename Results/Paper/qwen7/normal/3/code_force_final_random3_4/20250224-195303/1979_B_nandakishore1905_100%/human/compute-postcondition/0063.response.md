Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `f` is 0, `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is 2. If `k` is odd, `k` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `f` will eventually become 0 after the loop executes all iterations, `l` will be '0', and `p` will be 1.**
