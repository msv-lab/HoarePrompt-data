Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is \(|n - m|\), `f` is now \(k - 2^p - 2^{(p - 1)}\), `l` is the binary string representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`.**

Explanation: The code subtracts `q` from `f`, where `q` is calculated as \(2^{(p - 1)}\). Since `f` was initially \(k - 2^p\) and `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\), the new value of `f` becomes \(k - 2^p - 2^{(p - 1)}\). All other variables remain unchanged.
