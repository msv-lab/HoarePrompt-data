Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `f` is 0, `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is 2, `n` and `m` are updated to integers from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and converts them to integers, assigning them to `n` and `m` respectively. The values of `t`, `i`, `k`, `f`, `l`, `p`, and `q` remain unchanged from their initial states.
