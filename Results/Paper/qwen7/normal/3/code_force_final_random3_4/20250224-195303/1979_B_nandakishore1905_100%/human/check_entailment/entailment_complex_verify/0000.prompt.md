You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two distinct non-negative integers x and y . Consider two
infinite sequences a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots and b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots , where

  * a_n = n \oplus x ; 
  * b_n = n \oplus y . 

Here, x \oplus y denotes the [bitwise
XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation of
integers x and y .

For example, with x = 6 , the first 8 elements of sequence a will look as
follows: [7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \ldots] . Note that the indices of elements
start with 1 .

Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment^\dagger of
sequences a and b . In other words, find the maximum integer m such that a_i =
b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1} for some i,
j \ge 1 .

^\dagger A subsegment of sequence p is a sequence p_l,p_{l+1},\ldots,p_r ,
where 1 \le l \le r .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0 \le x, y \le
10^9, x \neq y ) — the parameters of the sequences.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common
subsegment.

Example

Input

    4
    
    0 1
    
    12 4
    
    57 37
    
    316560849 14570961

Output

    1
    8
    4
    33554432
    
Note

In the first test case, the first 7 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\ldots]

b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,\ldots]

It can be shown that there isn't a positive integer k such that the sequence
[k, k + 1] occurs in b as a subsegment. So the answer is 1 .

In the third test case, the first 20 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, \textbf{41,
40, 43, 42}, 45, \ldots]

b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 53,
52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]

It can be shown that one of the longest common subsegments is the subsegment
[41, 40, 43, 42] with a length of 4 .

    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the total number of test cases minus one, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2, `f` is 0, `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, and `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is 2. Otherwise, `f` is the highest power of 2 less than or equal to \(k - 2^p - 3 \cdot 2^{(p - 1)}\), `l` is the binary string representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of the binary string representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, and `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\).
    #
    #This final state indicates that after processing all test cases, for each test case, if the absolute difference `k` between `n` and `m` is a power of 2, the output is `k`. Otherwise, it outputs the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k - 2^p - 3 \cdot 2^{(p - 1)}`, where `p` is the length of the binary representation of `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers \(n\) and \(m\). For each test case, it calculates the absolute difference \(k\) between \(n\) and \(m\). If \(k\) is a power of 2, it prints \(k\). Otherwise, it finds the highest power of 2 less than or equal to \(k - 2^p - 3 \cdot 2^{(p - 1)}\), where \(p\) is the length of the binary representation of \(k\), and prints that value. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the length of the longest common subsegment between the sequences \(a\) and \(b\). The program instead attempts to find the highest power of 2 that divides the absolute difference between \(x\) and \(y\), which is not relevant to the problem.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input: `12 4`
- Expected Output: `8`

However, the program outputs `8` because:
- \(k = |12 - 4| = 8\)
- The binary representation of 8 is `1000`, which has a length of 4.
- The program calculates \(2^{(4-1)} = 8\).

This is incorrect because the actual longest common subsegment for \(a_n = n \oplus 12\) and \(b_n = n \oplus 4\) is longer than 8. For example, the sequences start as follows:
- \(a = [12, 13, 14, 9, 10, 11, 6, 7, 8, 15, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, 15, \ldots]\)
- \(b = [4, 5, 6, 11, 12, 13, 0, 1, 2, 3, 12, 13, 14, 9, 10, 11, 8, 7, \ldots]\)

The longest common subsegment is `[4, 5, 6, 11, 12, 13, 0, 1]`, which has a length of 8. However, the program incorrectly returns 8 based on the binary length calculation rather than the actual common subsegment length.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is thus incorrect.
