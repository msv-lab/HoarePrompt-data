Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `k` is not a power of 2, `k` is even, `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `f` is an even number that is not a power of 2, `l` is reassigned to the binary string representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix.**

Explanation: The code `l = bin(f).replace('0b', '')` reassigns `l` to the binary string representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `p`, and `f` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
