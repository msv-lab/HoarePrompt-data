Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` must not be a power of 2, `f` must be such that `(f - 2) & (f - 2 - 1) != 0`, `l` is a binary string representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is 2, `l` is updated to the binary string representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix.**

Explanation: The code `l = bin(f).replace('0b', '')` converts the integer `f` to its binary representation using `bin(f)` and then removes the '0b' prefix using `.replace('0b', '')`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
