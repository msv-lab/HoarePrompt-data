Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `f` is the highest power of 2 less than or equal to \(k - 2^p - 3 \cdot 2^{(p - 1)}\), `l` is the binary string representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of the binary string representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\).**

Explanation: If `k % 2 != 0`, then `f` remains 0 and `l` is "0" with `p` being 1 and `q` being 1. Otherwise, `f` is updated to the highest power of 2 less than or equal to \(k - 2^p - 3 \cdot 2^{(p - 1)}\) after the loop terminates, and `p` is the length of the binary string representation of this new value of `f`.
