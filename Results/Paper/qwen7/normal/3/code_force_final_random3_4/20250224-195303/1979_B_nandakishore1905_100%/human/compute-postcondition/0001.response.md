Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and splits them based on whitespace, converting each to an integer. These values are then assigned to `n` and `m`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The variable `i` is also unchanged and is still set to 0.
