Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is |n - m|, `f` is k - \(2^{(p - 1)}\), `l` is the binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\), `f` is now (k - \(2^{(p - 1)}) - \(2^{(p - 1)}\), `p` is the length of `l`, `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\).**

Explanation: The code `f = f - q` subtracts `q` from `f`. Since `q` is defined as \(2^{(p - 1)}\), `f` is now updated to `(k - \(2^{(p - 1)}) - \(2^{(p - 1)}\), which simplifies to `k - 2 * \(2^{(p - 1)}\). All other variables remain unchanged.
