Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alice and Bob are playing a game on n piles of stones. On each player's turn,
they select a positive integer k that is at most the size of the smallest
nonempty pile and remove k stones from each nonempty pile at once. The first
player who is unable to make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.

Given that Alice goes first, who will win the game if both players play
optimally?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
2\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of piles in the game.

The next line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ), where a_i is the initial number of stones in the i -th
pile.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line with the name of the winner, assuming
both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print "Alice", otherwise print
"Bob" (without quotes).

    5 7 2 9 6 3 3 2
    
    1
    
    1000000000

Output

    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can win by choosing k=3 on her first turn, which
will empty all of the piles at once.

In the second test case, Alice must choose k=1 on her first turn since there
is a pile of size 1 , so Bob can win on the next turn by choosing k=6 .

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    a = func_1(a)
    n = len(a)
    if func_2(a, n) == 1:
        print('Alice')
    else:
        print('Bob')

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of non-negative integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile, and a_new is a list that will store the transformed values after applying the function.
def func_1(a):
    a_new = sorted(list(set(a)))
    a_temp = a_new.copy()
    for i in range(1, len(a_new)):
        a_new[i] = a_new[i] - a_temp[i - 1]
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to the length of `a_new` minus 1; every element in `a_new` starting from the second element (`a_new[1]`) will have been reduced by the corresponding element in `a_temp` up to one less than its original index. In other words, for each `i` from 1 to the length of `a_new` minus 1, `a_new[i]` will be `a_new[i] - a_temp[i-1]`.
    #
    #This means that if `a_new` originally had `n` elements, after the loop completes, `a_new[1]` will be `a_new[1] - a_temp[0]`, `a_new[2]` will be `a_new[2] - a_temp[1]`, and so on, until `a_new[n-1]` will be `a_new[n-1] - a_temp[n-2]`.
    return a_new
    #The program returns a_new, where each element starting from the second element (a_new[1]) has been reduced by the corresponding element in a_temp up to one less than its original index.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of n integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile, and n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5.
def func_2(a, n):
    if (n == 1) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    else :
        if (n == 2) :
            if (a[0] % 2 == 0) :
                return 1
                #The program returns 1
            else :
                return 2
                #The program returns 2
        else :
            winNext = func_2(a[1:], n - 1)
            if (winNext == 2 or winNext == 1 and a[0] != 1) :
                return 1
                #The program returns 1
            else :
                return 2
                #The program returns 2
