Output State: **The program returns 2**

Given the conditions:
- `winNext` is the return value of `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`
- `winNext != 2`
- `(winNext == 1 and a[0] == 1)` is true

The code simply returns `2`. Since no other operations are performed, the only thing that changes is the return statement itself. Therefore, the program returns `2`.
