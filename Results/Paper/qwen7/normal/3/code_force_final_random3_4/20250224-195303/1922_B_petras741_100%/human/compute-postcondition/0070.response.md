Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop runs as long as `j < n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1.

3. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, after the first iteration, `j` becomes 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 1 (which it is, based on the given condition).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these updates.

**State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `j` is 2; `q[w[j]]` is incremented by 1**
