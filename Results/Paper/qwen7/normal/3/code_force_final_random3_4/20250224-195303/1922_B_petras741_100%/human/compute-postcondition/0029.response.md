Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `buffer` is a list containing integers from the input, `i` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `j` is `n`, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0, `eta` is a list containing the values `n - 1` and `j`.**

Explanation: The code `eta.append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the list `eta`. Since `j` is equal to `n`, the list `eta` now contains two elements: `n - 1` (previously) and `n` (now). All other variables remain unchanged.
