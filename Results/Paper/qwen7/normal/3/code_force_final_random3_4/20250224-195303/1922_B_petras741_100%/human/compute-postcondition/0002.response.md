State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `buffer` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `t`.
2. For the loop to execute, the variable `t` must be greater than 0 because `range(t)` will not produce any values if `t` is 0 or negative.
3. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 before entering the loop, as specified by the `range(t)` function.
4. The initial state of `buffer` (an empty list) does not affect the loop's execution condition.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is greater than 0 and `i` is initialized to 0.
