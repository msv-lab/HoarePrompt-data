Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, buffer is a list containing integers from the input, i is 0, n must be a non-negative integer, j is n, q is a list of length n + 1 where each element is 0, eta is a list containing the value `j`, and the current value of q[j] is greater than 0.**

The code `eta.append(j)` appends the value of `j` to the list `eta`. Since `j` is equal to `n`, `eta` now contains the value `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
