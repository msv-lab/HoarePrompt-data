Output State: **`n` is the final number of iterations, `j` is `n + 1`, `eta` is a list containing the value `n + 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `j` (which is `n + 1`) to the list `eta`. The values of `n` and `j` remain unchanged, and `eta` now contains the value `n + 1` in a list format.
