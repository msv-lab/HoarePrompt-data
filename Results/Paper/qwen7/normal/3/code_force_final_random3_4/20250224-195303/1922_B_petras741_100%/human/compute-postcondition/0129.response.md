Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for j in range(n + 1):`. The variables involved here are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `j` will be set to `n - 1` at the beginning of the loop.
   - `n` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, but it is used in the loop condition.

3. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `j` is set to `n - 1` at the start of the loop, we need to ensure that `j` is initialized to `n - 1`.
   - The value of `n` must be such that the loop can start, meaning `n` should be at least 1 (since `range(n + 1)` will generate values from 0 to `n`).

4. **Consider the initial state given**:
   - `eta` is an empty list.
   - `j` will be equal to `n - 1`.
   - For each index `k` in the list `w`, `q[k]` will be equal to the number of times `k` appears in the list `w`.

Since the loop itself does not directly depend on `eta`, `w`, or `q`, we do not need to adjust their states for the loop to execute. However, we need to ensure that the loop can start, which means `n` must be at least 1 and `j` must be initialized to `n - 1`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `j`.

**State:**
**`j` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 0**
