Output State: **`eta_ln` must be at least 2, `j` is 2, `res` is increased by `q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) // 2 * rho`, `rho` is increased by `q[eta[j]]`**.

Explanation: The variable `rho` is incremented by the value of `q[eta[j]]`. Given that `j` is 2, `rho` is increased by `q[eta[2]]`. The other variables (`eta_ln` and `res`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
