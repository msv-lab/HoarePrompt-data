Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `buffer` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `buffer`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was set to an integer input from the user within the specified range. All other variables remain unaffected.
