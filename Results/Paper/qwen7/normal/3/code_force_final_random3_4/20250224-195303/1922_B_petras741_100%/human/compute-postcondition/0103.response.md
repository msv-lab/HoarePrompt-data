Output State: **`eta_ln` must be at least 2, `j` is 3, `res` is increased by q[eta[3]] * (q[eta[3]] - 1) * (q[eta[3]] - 2) // 6.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `res` by adding the value of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6`. Given that `j` is 3, `eta[j]` is `eta[3]`. The value of `res` is increased by this expression, but since the exact value of `q[eta[3]]` is not provided, we express the updated value of `res` in terms of `q[eta[3]]`. The conditions and values of `eta_ln` and `j` remain unchanged.
