Output State: **`j` is 2; `lex` is a value less than or equal to 0; `arr` contains the elements 1, 26, and 26**

Explanation: The variable `lex` is decremented by 26. Since `lex` was initially a value less than or equal to 26, subtracting 26 from it will result in a value less than or equal to 0. The values of `j` and `arr` remain unchanged.
