Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state is given as `k` is 0.
2. The code snippet is `print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')`.

To determine what will be printed, we need to know the value of `arr[k]`:
- Since `k` is 0, we need to find `arr[0]`.
- The value of `arr[0]` is not explicitly given, so we cannot determine it precisely from the information provided.

Given this, we can only describe the output in terms of the value of `arr[0]` plus 96, converted to a character using `chr()`.

Output: **chr(arr[0] + 96)**
