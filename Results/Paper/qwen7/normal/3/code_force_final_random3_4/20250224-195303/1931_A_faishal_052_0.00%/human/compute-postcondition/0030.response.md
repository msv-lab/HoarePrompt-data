Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `j` is 1
- `lex` is a value less than or equal to 53
- `arr` contains the elements [1]
- If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` contains the element 1. Otherwise, `arr` contains the elements [1, 26]

### Loop Statement
```python
for j in range(2):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables are `j`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j < 2`.

### Current State
- `j` is currently 1.

### Next Iteration
- For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented from 1 to 2.
- Therefore, `j` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.

### Adjusting States
- The state of `j` changes from 1 to 2.
- The states of `lex` and `arr` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

### New State
State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is a value less than or equal to 53, and `arr` contains the elements [1]**.

However, since the condition for `arr` depends on the value of `lex`:
- If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` will contain the element 1.
- Otherwise, `arr` will contain the elements [1, 26].

Given that `lex` is still a value less than or equal to 53, it could either be less than or equal to 26 or greater than 26. But since the exact value of `lex` is not specified, we keep the general condition for `arr`.

### Final State
State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is a value less than or equal to 53, and `arr` contains the elements [1]**.

If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, then `arr` contains the element 1. Otherwise, `arr` contains the elements [1, 26].
