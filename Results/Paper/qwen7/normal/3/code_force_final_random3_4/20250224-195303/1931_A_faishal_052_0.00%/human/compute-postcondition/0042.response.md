Output State: **j is 2, lex is a value less than or equal to 27, and arr contains the elements [1, 1, lex]**.

The code `arr.append(lex)` appends the value of `lex` to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` contains the elements `[1, 1]`. After appending `lex`, `arr` becomes `[1, 1, lex]`. The values of `j` and `lex` remain unchanged.
