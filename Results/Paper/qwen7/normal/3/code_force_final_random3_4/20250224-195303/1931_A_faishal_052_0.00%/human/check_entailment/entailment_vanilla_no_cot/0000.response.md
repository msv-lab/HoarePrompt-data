Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded values into the lexicographically smallest word. Let's analyze why:

1. **Logic Flaw**: The program incorrectly handles the decoding process. It assumes that the first two letters can only be 'a' or 'z', which is not true. For example, for `lex = 24`, it should produce "cat" instead of "aav".

2. **Incorrect Decoding Process**: The logic inside the loop is flawed. It does not properly distribute the remaining value after accounting for the first two letters. 

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        # Determine the first character
        first_char = lex // 26
        lex %= 26
        
        # Determine the second character
        second_char = lex // 26
        lex %= 26
        
        # Determine the third character
        third_char = lex + 1
        
        # Convert numbers to characters
        first_letter = chr(first_char + 96) if first_char != 0 else 'a'
        second_letter = chr(second_char + 96) if second_char != 0 else 'a'
        third_letter = chr(third_char + 96)
        
        print(f"{first_letter}{second_letter}{third_letter}")

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the word is decoded correctly and lexicographically.
