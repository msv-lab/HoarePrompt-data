Output State: **`j` is 0; `lex` is greater than 26 and greater than or equal to 52; `arr` contains the element 26**.

Explanation: The code appends the value 26 to the list `arr`. The variables `j` and `lex` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `j` is still 0, `lex` is still greater than 26 and greater than or equal to 52, and `arr` now contains the element 26.
