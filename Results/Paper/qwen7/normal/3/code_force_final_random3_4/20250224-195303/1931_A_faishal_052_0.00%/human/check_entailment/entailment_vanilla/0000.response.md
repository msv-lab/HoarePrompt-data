### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`cases`).
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   
2. **Decoding Logic**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `arr`.
   - It attempts to decode the input integer `lex` into three letters.
   - The logic inside the loop is flawed:
     - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it incorrectly appends 1 and subtracts 1 from `lex`. This is not a valid approach since it doesn't account for the full range of possible values.
     - If `lex` is between 27 and 51, it incorrectly appends 26 and subtracts 26 from `lex`. Again, this is not a valid approach.
     - If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, it again incorrectly appends 26 and subtracts 26 from `lex`.

3. **Final Decoding**:
   - After the loop, the program appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.
   - It then sorts `arr` and prints the characters corresponding to the sorted indices plus 96 (to convert the index to the corresponding character).

### Issues with the Program:
- The logic for decoding the integer `lex` into the three letters is incorrect. It does not handle the range of values correctly.
- The sorting and printing logic assumes that the values in `arr` represent valid letters, which they do not due to the flawed decoding logic.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly decode the integer `n` into the lexicographically smallest word, we need to:
1. Determine the largest possible letter (index) that can fit into the remaining value of `n`.
2. Subtract the value of that letter from `n` and repeat the process for the remaining two letters.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        result = []
        for _ in range(3):
            if lex >= 26:
                result.append(26)
                lex -= 26
            else:
                result.append(lex)
                break
        for i in range(2, 0, -1):
            if result[i] == 26:
                result[i] = 1
                result[i-1] += 1
        result.sort()
        for k in range(3):
            print(chr(result[k] + 96), end='')
        print()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the flawed decoding logic. Therefore, the given program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
