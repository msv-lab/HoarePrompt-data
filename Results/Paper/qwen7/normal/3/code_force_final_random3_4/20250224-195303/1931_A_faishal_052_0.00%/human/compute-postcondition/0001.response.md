State: **`cases` must be an integer such that 1 ≤ cases ≤ 100, and for each test case, `n` must be an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, i is 1** 

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` starts from 0, so before the loop starts, `i` should be set to 0.
- The loop condition depends on the variable `cases`, which determines how many times the loop will run. Therefore, `cases` must be within the range 1 to 100.
- For each test case inside the loop, `n` must be an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect these conditions.
