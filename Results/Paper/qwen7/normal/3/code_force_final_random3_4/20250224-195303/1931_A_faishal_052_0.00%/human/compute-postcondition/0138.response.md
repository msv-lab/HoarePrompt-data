Output State: **`j` is 2; `lex` is a value less than or equal to 25; `arr` contains the elements 1, 26, and 1.**

Explanation: The variable `lex` is decremented by 1, making it one less than its original value, which was less than or equal to 26. Therefore, the new value of `lex` is now less than or equal to 25. The values of `j` and `arr` remain unchanged.
