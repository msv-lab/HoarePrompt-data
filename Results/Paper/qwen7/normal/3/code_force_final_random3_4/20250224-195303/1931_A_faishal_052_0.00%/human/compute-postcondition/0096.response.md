Output State: `cases` is 3, `arr` is one of the following lists: `[1, 1, 1]`, `[26, 1, 1]`, `[1, 26, 1]`, `[26, 26, 1]`, `[1, 1, 26]`, `[26, 1, 26]`, `[1, 26, 26]`, `[26, 26, 26]`, `j` is 2, and `lex` is an input integer that has been reduced by either 1 or 26 for each element in the final list `arr` depending on the conditions met during each iteration of the loop.

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, `cases` remains 3, `arr` will contain exactly 3 elements which can be either 1 or 26 based on the conditions inside the loop, `j` will be 2 (since the loop runs in a range of 2), and `lex` will be an integer that has been reduced by a total of 3 (if all elements in `arr` are 1) or 78 (if all elements in `arr` are 26).
