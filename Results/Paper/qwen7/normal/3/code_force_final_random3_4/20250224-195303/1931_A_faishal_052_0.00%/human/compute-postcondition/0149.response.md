Output State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is a value less than or equal to 26, `arr` contains the elements 1, 26, and `lex`, sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The `sort()` method sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. Initially, `arr` contains the elements 1, 26, and `lex`. Since `lex` is a value less than or equal to 26, after sorting, the list `arr` will be [1, lex, 26] if `lex` is less than 26, or [1, 26, lex] if `lex` is equal to 26. However, since the exact value of `lex` is not specified, we keep it as a variable. The other variables `j` and `lex` remain unchanged.
