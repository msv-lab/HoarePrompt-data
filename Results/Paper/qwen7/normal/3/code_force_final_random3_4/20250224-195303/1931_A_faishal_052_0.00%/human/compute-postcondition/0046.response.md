Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variable in the given code is `k`.
2. **Determine the range of the loop**: The loop runs from `k = 0` to `k = 2` (inclusive), as specified by `range(3)`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: `k` is 0.
4. **Next iteration requirements**: For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be less than 3. Since `k` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `k` would be 1.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `k` should be 1.

**State: **`k` is 1**
