Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head specifies `j in range(2)`. Therefore, the only variable involved in the loop condition is `j`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `j`**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition states that `j` is 0.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than 2 (since `range(2)` generates values from 0 to 1).

4. **Adjust the state of `j`**: Since the loop is iterating over `range(2)`, `j` will increment by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be 1.

5. **Check the other variables**: The variables `lex` and `arr` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted based on the loop itself. They remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`j` is 1, `lex` is a value less than or equal to 52, and `arr` contains the element corresponding to the value of `lex`. Specifically, if `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` contains the element 1; if `lex` is equal to 26 or a value between 26 and 52, `arr` contains the element 26.**
