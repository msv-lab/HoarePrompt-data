Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `k` and the range function `range(3)`. This means the loop will iterate over the values `0`, `1`, and `2`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `k`**: Since the loop starts with `k = 0` (as per the `range(3)`), we need to ensure that `k` is set to `0` at the start of the loop.

3. **Check if the Loop Can Execute**: The loop will execute as long as `k` is within the range `0` to `2`. Given that `k` starts at `0` and the loop will increment `k` in each iteration, the loop will definitely execute three times.

4. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that `k` is set to `0` at the start of the loop. The other variables (`cases`, `arr`, `j`, and `lex`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `k` to be `0`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`k` is 0**
