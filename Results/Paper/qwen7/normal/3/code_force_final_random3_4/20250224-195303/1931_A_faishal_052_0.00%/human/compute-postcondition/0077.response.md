Output State: **`cases` is 3, `arr` is either `[1, 26]` or `[26, 26]`, `j` is 1 or 2, `lex` is an input integer - 26**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is decremented by 26. Since `lex` was initially an input integer, after the operation, `lex` becomes `lex - 26`. The values of `cases`, `arr`, and `j` remain unchanged.
