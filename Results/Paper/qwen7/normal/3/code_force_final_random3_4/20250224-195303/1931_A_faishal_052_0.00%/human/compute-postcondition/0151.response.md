Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state is given as `k` is 0.
2. The code snippet contains `print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')`.
3. To determine what will be printed, we need to know the value of `arr[0]`.
4. Since the value of `arr[0]` is not explicitly given, we cannot determine it precisely. However, we can still describe the output in terms of the value of `arr[0]`.

Let's denote the value of `arr[0]` as `val`.

- The expression inside the `chr` function is `arr[k] + 96`.
- Given `k = 0`, this becomes `arr[0] + 96` or `val + 96`.
- The `chr` function converts an integer to its corresponding ASCII character.
- Adding 96 to `val` shifts the ASCII value of `val` by 96 positions.

Without the explicit value of `arr[0]`, we can only describe the output in terms of `val`.

Output: **chr(val + 96)**
