Output State: The loop has executed all its iterations, printing 'a', 'b', and 'c' in sequence.

Explanation: Given the loop runs three times as specified by `range(3)`, and each iteration processes the value of `lex` to form an array `arr` which is then sorted and printed. Regardless of the initial value of `lex` (as long as it's within the given constraints), the final sorted array `arr` will always be `[1, 26, lex]` after the operations inside the loop. When sorted, this array becomes `[1, 26, lex]` (assuming `lex` is less than or equal to 26). Converting these values to characters using `chr(arr[k] + 96)` results in 'a', 'b', and 'c'. Therefore, after all iterations, the loop prints 'a', 'b', and 'c' in sequence.
