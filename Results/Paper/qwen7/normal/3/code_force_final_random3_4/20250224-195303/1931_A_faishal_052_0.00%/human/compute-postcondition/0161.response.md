Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each involving an integer `lex`. For each test case, it calculates a sequence of values based on `lex` and prints the first three characters of the resulting sequence. Specifically, it converts the calculated values into characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' and outputs them in that order. The function accepts no parameters and does not return any value; instead, it directly prints the output.**
