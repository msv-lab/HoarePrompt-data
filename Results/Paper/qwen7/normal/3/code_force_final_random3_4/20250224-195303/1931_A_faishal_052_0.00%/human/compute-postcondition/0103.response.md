Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop is defined as `for k in range(3)`. This means `k` takes values from 0 to 2.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is 1. 

3. **Determine the Next Value of `k`**: Since the loop increments `k` by 1 each time it iterates, the next value of `k` would be 2.

4. **Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `k` is less than 3. Since `k` is currently 1, it will iterate again when `k` becomes 2.

5. **Adjust the State**: We need to update the state such that `k` is 2 for the next iteration of the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`k` is 2**
