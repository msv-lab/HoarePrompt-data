Output State: **`j` is 2, `lex` is a value less than or equal to 26, `arr` contains the elements 1, 26, and `lex`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `lex` to the list `arr`. Initially, `arr` contains the elements 1, 26, and 1. After appending `lex`, `arr` will contain the elements 1, 26, and `lex`. The values of `j` and `lex` remain unchanged.
