Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Calculating Character Positions**: The program attempts to break down the input `lex` into three parts, but it does so in a way that doesn't match the requirements of the problem. It tries to fit `lex` into predefined ranges (up to 26, between 27 and 52, etc.), which is not appropriate for this problem.

2. **Output Order**: The program always prints 'a', 'b', and 'c' in that specific order, regardless of the actual character positions that sum up to `lex`. This means it does not consider the lexicographically smallest combination of three letters that sum up to `lex`.

3. **Handling of Lexicographical Order**: The program does not ensure that the output is the lexicographically smallest word. For example, for `lex = 24`, the program incorrectly outputs "abc" instead of "aav".

To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the three smallest possible letters that sum up to `lex`. We should start with the smallest possible letters and adjust as necessary to meet the sum requirement.

Correctness: **False**
