Given the initial state where `k` is 1, we need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')`.

From the initial state, we know:
- `k` is 1.

However, the value of `arr` is not explicitly provided. Since `k` is 1, we need to consider the value of `arr[1]`. Without the explicit value of `arr[1]`, we cannot determine the exact character that will be printed. But we can describe it in terms of the formula used.

The formula used is `chr(arr[k] + 96)`. Given `k` is 1, this translates to `chr(arr[1] + 96)`.

Therefore, the output will be the character corresponding to the value of `arr[1] + 96`.

Output: **chr(arr[1] + 96)**
