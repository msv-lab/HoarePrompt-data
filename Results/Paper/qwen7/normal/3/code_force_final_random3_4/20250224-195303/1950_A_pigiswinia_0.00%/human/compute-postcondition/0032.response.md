Output State: **The loop has executed all its iterations, with `t` being the total number of iterations specified initially. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` have been updated according to the conditions within the loop for each iteration. If `a < b < c` was true for any iteration, 'STAIRS' was printed for that iteration; if `a < b > c` was true, 'PEAK' was printed; otherwise, 'NONE' was printed. The variable `i` is now equal to `t - 1`, as the loop runs from `i` in the range `0` to `t-1`.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will reflect the most recent inputs processed within the loop, and the output consists of 'STAIRS', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' based on the conditions met during each iteration. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and `i` is set to `t-1` indicating the last iteration of the loop.
