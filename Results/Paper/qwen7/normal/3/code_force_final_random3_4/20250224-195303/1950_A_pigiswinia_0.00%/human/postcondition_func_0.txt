The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` sets of three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. For each set, it checks if `a < b < c` or `a < b > c`. If the first condition is met, it prints 'STAIRS'; if the second condition is met, it prints 'PEAK'; otherwise, it prints 'NONE'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.
