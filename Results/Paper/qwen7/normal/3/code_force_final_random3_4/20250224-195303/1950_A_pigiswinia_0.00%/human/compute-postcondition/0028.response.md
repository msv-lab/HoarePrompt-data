Based on the initial state provided:

- `a`, `b`, `c` are integers from input.
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
- `i` is assigned the value of `t`.

The `print('NONE')` statement simply prints the string `'NONE'` regardless of the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, `t`, or `i`.

Output: **NONE**
