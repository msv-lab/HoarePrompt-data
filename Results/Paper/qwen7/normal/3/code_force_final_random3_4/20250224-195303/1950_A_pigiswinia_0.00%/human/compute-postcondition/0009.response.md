Based on the initial state provided:

- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers from input.
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
- The condition `a >= b` or `b >= c` holds true.
- The current values satisfy `a < b > c`.

The print statement is:

```python
print('PEAK')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'PEAK'`. Since no values of `a`, `b`, `c`, or `t` are used in the print statement, they do not affect the output.

Output: **PEAK**
