Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c` are integers from input, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and `i` is `t-1`.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. However, the values of `t` and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, `t` remains an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and `i` remains `t-1`.
