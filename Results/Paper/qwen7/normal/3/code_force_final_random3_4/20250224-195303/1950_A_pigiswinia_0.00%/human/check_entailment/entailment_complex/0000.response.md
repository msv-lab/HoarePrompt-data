Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates over each test case, reading three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` for each case.
3. The conditions for determining whether the numbers form a stair or a peak are correctly implemented:
   - `a < b < c` for a stair.
   - `a < b > c` for a peak.
4. If neither condition is met, it correctly prints "NONE".
5. The function processes all test cases as expected and does not return any value, which is consistent with the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
