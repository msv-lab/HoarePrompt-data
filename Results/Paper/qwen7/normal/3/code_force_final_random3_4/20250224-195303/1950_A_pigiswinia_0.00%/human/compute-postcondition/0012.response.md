Postcondition: `a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input, `c` is an integer from input, and `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive. The condition `a >= b` or `b >= c` holds true. If `a < b > c` is satisfied, the condition remains as is. Otherwise, `a < b` and `b < c` holds true.
