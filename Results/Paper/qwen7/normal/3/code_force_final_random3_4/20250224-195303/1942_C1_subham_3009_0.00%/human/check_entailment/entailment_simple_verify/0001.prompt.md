You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, x, and y are positive integers such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and y = 0. The input also includes a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, and the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.

        #State: t equals 0, n is an integer, x is an integer; arr is a list of integers where each element is the integer conversion of the corresponding element in the input string split by spaces, and t is no longer greater than 0.
    #State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. After the execution of the if else block, if t equals 0, n and x are integers, and arr is a list of integers where each element is the integer conversion of the corresponding element in the input string split by spaces. Otherwise, t is still a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and no changes are made to n, x, or arr.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`.
   - It then reads `x` integers representing the chosen vertices.

2. **Processing Input:**
   - The program correctly extracts the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input.
   - It also correctly processes the list of `x` chosen vertices.

3. **Calculating Output:**
   - The program prints `x - 2` for each test case.

### Problem Description Recap
- **Objective:** Maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.
- **Constraints:**
  - `n` is the number of sides of the polygon.
  - `x` is the number of vertices already chosen by Bessie.
  - `y` is the maximum number of additional vertices you can choose (in this version, `y = 0`).
- **Key Insight:** To maximize the number of triangular pieces, we need to use as many of the chosen vertices as possible to form triangles. Each set of 3 chosen vertices can form one triangle.

### Analysis of the Given Program
- The program correctly identifies the number of chosen vertices (`x`).
- However, the logic to calculate the maximum number of triangular pieces is flawed.
  - The formula `x - 2` is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that the vertices must form triangles.
  - Specifically, for any set of 3 vertices, they can form one triangle. Therefore, the maximum number of triangles that can be formed using `x` vertices is `x - 2` only if `x >= 3`. If `x < 3`, no triangles can be formed.

### Correct Logic
- If `x < 3`, the output should be `0` because no triangles can be formed.
- If `x >= 3`, the output should be `x - 2`.

### Revised Program
```python
def func():
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        t = int(input())
        while t > 0:
            t -= 1
            [n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())
            arr = input().split()
            arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]
            if x < 3:
                print(0)
            else:
                print(x - 2)
```

### Conclusion
The given program is incorrect because it always prints `x - 2` without checking if `x` is at least 3. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Correctness: **False**
