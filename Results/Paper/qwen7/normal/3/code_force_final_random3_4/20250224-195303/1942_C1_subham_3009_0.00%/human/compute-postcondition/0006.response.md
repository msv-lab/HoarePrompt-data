Output State: **`t` is a positive integer less than its original value, `n` is converted to an integer, `x` remains as a string, `y` remains as a string, `arr` is a list of integers converted from the strings `[n, x, y]`.**

Explanation: The code converts each element in the list `arr` (which contains the strings `n`, `x`, and `y`) into integers. Since `n`, `x`, and `y` are originally strings representing integers, they are now converted to integer values. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the operation. The variable `x` and `y` remain as strings because they are not modified by the code.
