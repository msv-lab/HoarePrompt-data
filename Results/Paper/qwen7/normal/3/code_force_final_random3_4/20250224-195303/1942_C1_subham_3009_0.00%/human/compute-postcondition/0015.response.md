Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is a string, `x` is an integer, `y` is a string; `arr` is a list of integers where each element is converted from the corresponding element in the original `arr` list using `int(arr[i])` for `i` in range `x`.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is decremented by 1, making `t` greater than 0 since it was initially greater than 1. The other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`) remain unchanged as the operation only affects `t`.
