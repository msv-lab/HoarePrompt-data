Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer; `arr` is a list of integers where each element is converted from the corresponding element in the original `arr` list using `int(arr[i])` for `i` in range `x`.**

Explanation: The code `map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting integers to the list `[n, x, y]`. This means that `n`, `x`, and `y` are now integers. The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` remain unchanged except that `n`, `x`, and `y` are now integers instead of their previous types (string, integer, string).
