Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads values of \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \) (with \( y \) always being 0), and a list of \( x \) distinct integers from 1 to \( n \). It then prints the value \( x - 2 \) for each test case. After processing all test cases, it ensures that the variable \( t \) is set to 0, indicating the end of all test cases.**
