You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, x, and y are positive integers such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and y = 0. The input also includes a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, and the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func():
    if (__name__ == '__main__') :
        t = int(input())
        while t > 0:
            t -= 1
            
            [n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())
            
            arr = input().split()
            
            arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]
            
            print(x - 2)
            
        #State: t equals 0, n is an integer, x is an integer; arr is a list of integers where each element is the integer conversion of the corresponding element in the input string split by spaces, and t is no longer greater than 0.
    #State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. After the execution of the if else block, if t equals 0, n and x are integers, and arr is a list of integers where each element is the integer conversion of the corresponding element in the input string split by spaces. Otherwise, t is still a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and no changes are made to n, x, or arr.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of test cases. Each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each t, it receives n, x, and y as positive integers (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), y = 0). Additionally, it receives a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. The function returns a result based on the given inputs for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
