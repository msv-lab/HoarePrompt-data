Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` must be at least 1
   - `k` is `k - 2` (This variable is not part of the loop head and does not affect the loop condition)

4. **Update the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0, after the first iteration, `i` will become 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still satisfy the condition `i < n`. Given that `i` becomes 1, `n` must be at least 2.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration should reflect these changes.

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 2**
