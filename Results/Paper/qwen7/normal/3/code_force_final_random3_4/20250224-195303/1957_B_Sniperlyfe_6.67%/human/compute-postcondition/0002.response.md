Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` must be at least 1; `nums[0]` is 2^(k.bit_length() - 1) - 1**

Explanation: The code sets the value of `nums[i]` to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. Given that `i` is initially 0, `nums[0]` is updated to this value. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was not directly involved in the operation. The precondition that `i` is 0 and `n` must be at least 1 is still valid. The exact value of `nums[0]` depends on the bit length of `k`, but it is expressed as `2^(k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`.
