Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `i` is 1
  - `k` is `k - 2`

- **For Loop Statement:**
  ```python
  for i in range(n):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` is used in the loop condition `i in range(n)`.
   - The loop variable `n` is used in the loop condition `i in range(n)`.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - Since `i` is currently 1, the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
   - We need to determine the value of `n` such that the loop can execute again.

3. **Initial Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - `k` is updated by subtracting 2 from its previous value, but this does not affect the loop condition directly.

4. **Loop Condition:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration, so it will become 2.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than 2 to allow the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
- `i` will be 2 after the next iteration.
- `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

### Answer:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**
