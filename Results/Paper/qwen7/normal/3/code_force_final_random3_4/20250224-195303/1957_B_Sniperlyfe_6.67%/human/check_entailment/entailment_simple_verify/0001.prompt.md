You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        k -= nums[i]
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and k are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        
        k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: Output State: All elements in the `nums` list are set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and the variable `k` is reduced by the sum of all values assigned to `nums`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`. In each iteration, `nums[i]` is set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is the largest value that can be represented with `k.bit_length()` bits. This value is then subtracted from `k`. After `n` iterations, `k` will be reduced by the sum of `n` such values, and all elements in the `nums` list will be equal to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`.
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list `nums` where each element is initially set to the value `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`, then `k` is reduced by the sum of all values in `nums`, and finally, `nums[-1]` is incremented by the final value of `k`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to generate a sequence of `n` non-negative integers such that their sum equals `k`, and the number of `1`s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these numbers is maximized.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It calls a function `func_1(n, k)` to generate the sequence.
   - The generated sequence is stored and printed in the required format.

3. **Analyzing `func_1(n, k)`**:
   - The function initializes an array `nums` of size `n` with zeros.
   - It then sets each element of `nums` to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. This value is the largest number with `k.bit_length()` bits, which is `2^(k.bit_length()) - 1`.
   - After setting all elements to this value, it subtracts this value from `k`.
   - Finally, it adjusts the last element to ensure the total sum is `k`.

4. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed because it sets all elements to the same large number, which does not necessarily maximize the number of `1`s in the bitwise OR of the sequence.
   - For example, consider `n = 2` and `k = 3`. The function will set both elements to `3`, resulting in `[3, 3]`, which sums to `6` and has only `2` ones in the bitwise OR (`3 | 3 = 3`).
   - A better approach would be to distribute the sum `k` among the elements in a way that maximizes the number of `1`s in the bitwise OR.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as stated. It does not maximize the number of `1`s in the bitwise OR of the sequence.
