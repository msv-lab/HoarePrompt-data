Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution attempts to construct a sequence of `n` integers that sum up to `k`, but it does not correctly maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic**: The function `func_1` initializes each element of the list `nums` to `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`. This creates a sequence where each number is a bitmask with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit of `k`. However, this does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Sum**: After setting each element to the highest possible bitmask, the code subtracts from `k` and adjusts the last element. This approach does not guarantee that the bitwise OR will be maximized.

### Correct Approach:
To maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR, you should distribute the sum `k` across the sequence in a way that maximizes the number of 1s in the OR operation. One effective strategy is to use the largest possible numbers that fit within the constraints and ensure their OR operation results in a high number of 1s.

Hereâ€™s a revised version of the solution:

```python
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    # Initialize the result list
    result = [0] * n
    # Distribute the sum k across the sequence
    for i in range(n):
        if k >= 1:
            result[i] = 1
            k -= 1
        else:
            break
    # If k is still greater than 0, add the remaining value to the last element
    if k > 0:
        result[-1] += k
    return result
```

### Explanation of the Revised Solution:
1. **Initialization**: Create a list `result` of size `n` initialized to 0.
2. **Distribute 1s**: For each position in the list, if `k` is greater than or equal to 1, set the current element to 1 and decrement `k`.
3. **Handle Remaining Sum**: If there is still a remaining value in `k` after distributing 1s, add this value to the last element of the list.

This approach ensures that the sequence sums to `k` while maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence.
