Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `t` is `t`, `a` is an input string.**

Explanation: The variable `a` is assigned the value of the input provided by the user, which is treated as a string since no type conversion is specified. The values of `i`, `t`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
