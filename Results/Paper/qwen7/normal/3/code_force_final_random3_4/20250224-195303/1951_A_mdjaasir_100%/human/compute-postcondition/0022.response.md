Postcondition: `a` is a string input by the user, `count` is the number of '1's in the string `a`. If `count` is greater than 2 and even, the function does not change `count`. If `count` is 0, 1, or greater than 2 but not even, the function does not change `count`. If `count` is 2, the character immediately following the first '1' in `a` is not '1'.
