Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head specifies the range for `i` as `range(win_with_swap, k - 1)`. Therefore, the variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `win_with_swap`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `k - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `win_with_swap + 2` and `win_with_swap` is `win_with_swap + 2`. This means `i` is `win_with_swap + 2` and `win_with_swap` is `win_with_swap + 2`.

3. **Update the States:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration (as per the range), at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `win_with_swap + 3`.
   - `win_with_swap` remains unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no such modification is mentioned, it stays the same.

4. **Ensure the Loop Condition is Met:**
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `k - 1`. Given that `i` is now `win_with_swap + 3` and `win_with_swap` is `win_with_swap + 2`, `i` is indeed `win_with_swap + 3`.

5. **Formulate the New State:**
   - `i` is updated to `win_with_swap + 3`.
   - `win_with_swap` remains `win_with_swap + 2`.
   - `win_with_swap` must still be less than `k - 1`.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `i` is `win_with_swap + 3`, `win_with_swap` is `win_with_swap + 2`, and `win_with_swap` must be less than `k - 1`.**
