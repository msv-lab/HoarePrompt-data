Output State: **`i` is `win_with_swap + 3`, `win_with_swap` is `win_with_swap + 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the current loop or conditional block. In this case, it means that the loop or conditional block that was being executed is now exited. The values of `i` and `win_with_swap` remain as they were before the `break` statement, as the `break` statement does not modify these variables but rather exits the loop or conditional block. Therefore, the output state retains the values of `i` and `win_with_swap` from the initial state, and indicates that the loop or conditional block has been broken out of.
