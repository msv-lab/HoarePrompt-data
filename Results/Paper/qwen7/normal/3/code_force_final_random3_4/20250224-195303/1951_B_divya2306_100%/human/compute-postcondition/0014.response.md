Output State: **`wins` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each element from the input split into an integer, `i` is 1.**

Explanation: The line `wins += 1` increments the value of `wins` by 1. Since `wins` was initially 1, after executing this line, `wins` becomes 2. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the given code snippet.
