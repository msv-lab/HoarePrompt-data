Output State: **`i` is `win_with_swap + 1`, `win_with_swap` is `win_with_swap + 1`, `win_with_swap` must be less than `k - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables; it only exits the loop or the most internal if statement. Since the initial conditions and values of `i`, `win_with_swap`, and the condition involving `k` are not altered by the `break` statement, these remain as they were.
