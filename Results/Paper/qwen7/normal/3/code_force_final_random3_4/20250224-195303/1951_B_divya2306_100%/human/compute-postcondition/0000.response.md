Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and `n` and `k` are assigned the values from input.split().**

This means that the initial value of `t` remains unchanged, while `n` and `k` are assigned the first and second values respectively from the input split by spaces.
