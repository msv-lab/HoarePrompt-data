Based on the initial state provided:

- `wins` is explicitly given as 3.
- `t`, `n`, and `k` are integers with specific ranges but their exact values are not provided.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping each element from the input split into an integer, but the contents of `a` are not specified.
- `i` is explicitly given as 3.
- `wins` is also mentioned to be greater than or equal to `k`.

The print statement is `print(wins - 1)`. Given that `wins` is explicitly stated to be 3, we can directly compute `wins - 1` as 2.

Output: **2**
