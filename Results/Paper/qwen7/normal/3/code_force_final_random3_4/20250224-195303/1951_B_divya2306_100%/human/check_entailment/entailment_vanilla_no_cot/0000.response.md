Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Logic Error in `func_1` Function:**
   - The logic for determining the number of wins without any swaps is flawed. The current implementation checks if the cow at position `i` has a higher rating than the cow at position `k-1` and increments the `wins` counter. However, this does not correctly simulate the tournament structure.
   - The program should check if the cow at position `i` would win against the cow at position `i+1` in the actual tournament sequence, not just compare ratings directly.

2. **Swapping Logic:**
   - The swapping logic also needs to be reconsidered. The current approach assumes that the cow at position `i` (where `i < k`) will always lose to the cow at position `k-1` before the swap, which is not necessarily true. The program should consider the relative positions and ratings more carefully.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to:
1. Determine the initial number of wins the cow at position `k` can achieve without any swaps.
2. Consider the effect of swapping the cow at position `k` with other cows to potentially increase the number of wins.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))

        # Find the position of cow k in the sorted list
        pos_k = a.index(a[k-1])

        # Calculate initial wins without swap
        initial_wins = min(pos_k, n - pos_k - 1)

        # Calculate potential wins with swap
        max_wins = initial_wins
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] > a[k-1]:
                break
            if i < k-1:
                max_wins += 1
            else:
                break

        print(max_wins)
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly simulates the tournament and calculates the maximum number of wins considering both the initial position and potential swaps.
