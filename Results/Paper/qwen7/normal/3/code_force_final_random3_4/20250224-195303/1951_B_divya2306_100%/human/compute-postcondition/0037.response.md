Output State: **`i` is `win_with_swap + 2`, `win_with_swap` is `win_with_swap + 2`, and `win_with_swap` must be less than `k - 1`.**

Explanation: The line `win_with_swap += 1` increments the value of `win_with_swap` by 1. Given the initial state where `i` is `win_with_swap + 1` and `win_with_swap` is `win_with_swap + 1`, after incrementing `win_with_swap`, its new value becomes `win_with_swap + 2`. Consequently, `i` becomes `win_with_swap + 2`. The condition that `win_with_swap` must be less than `k - 1` remains unchanged.
