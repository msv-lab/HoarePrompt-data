Output State: **`i` is `win_with_swap`, and `win_with_swap` must be less than `k - 1`. The current value of `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the innermost loop or conditional block. Therefore, the values of `i`, `win_with_swap`, and the condition involving `k - 1` remain unchanged. Additionally, the condition that the current value of `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]` also remains valid.
