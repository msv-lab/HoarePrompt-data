Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x.**

Explanation: The code `x, n = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `x` and `n` respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
