Reasoning:
The provided program aims to find the maximum balance (GCD) of the difficulties of \(n\) sub-problems whose sum is equal to \(x\). The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum GCD by iterating through all divisors of \(x\) and checking if either the divisor or its complement is less than or equal to \(n\).

Here's a breakdown of the steps:
1. The program reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads \(x\) and \(n\).
3. It iterates through all numbers from 1 to \(\sqrt{x}\) to check if they are divisors of \(x\).
4. If a number \(i\) is a divisor of \(x\), it checks if \(i\) or \(x // i\) is less than or equal to \(n\).
5. It updates the maximum GCD found so far.
6. Finally, it prints the maximum GCD for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to be correct. It efficiently finds the maximum balance by leveraging the properties of divisors and ensuring the sum constraint is met.

Correctness: **True**
