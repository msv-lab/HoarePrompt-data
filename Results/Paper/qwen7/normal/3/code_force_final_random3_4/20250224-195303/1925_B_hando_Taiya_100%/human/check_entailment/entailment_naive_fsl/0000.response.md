Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum balance for all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to consider the scenario where the number of sub-problems \( n \) is greater than the square root of \( x \). This leads to missing optimal solutions in some cases.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
12 4
```
The expected output should be `3` because we can split the problem into difficulties `[3, 3, 3, 3]`, which gives a GCD of `3`.

However, the current implementation only checks divisibility up to the square root of \( x \), and it does not properly handle cases where \( n \) is greater than the square root of \( x \).

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that it considers all possible ways to divide \( x \) into \( n \) parts and calculates the GCD for each valid division.
