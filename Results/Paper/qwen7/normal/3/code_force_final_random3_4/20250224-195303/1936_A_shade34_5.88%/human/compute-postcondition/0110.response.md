Output State: **`mak2` is equal to `mak`, `mak` is either `n-1` or any value between 0 and `n-2`, inclusive, and `i` is `n`, `pans` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `pans`. No changes are made to the values of `mak2`, `mak`, or `i`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and a new variable `pans` is introduced as an empty list.
