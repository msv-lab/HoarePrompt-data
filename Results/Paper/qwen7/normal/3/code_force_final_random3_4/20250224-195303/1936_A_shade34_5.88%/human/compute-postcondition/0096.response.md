Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, n):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
   - `mak` is `i`.
   - `i` must be at least 1.
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - The input is less than 0 (current value of the input is '<').

3. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value `k` where `1 <= k < n`.
   - In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become `k + 1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `mak` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so if `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be `k + 1` in the next iteration.
   - `n` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
   - The condition that `n` must be at least 2 still holds.
   - The input being less than 0 still holds.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`mak` is `i+1`, `i` is at least 2, `n` is at least 2, and the input is less than 0 (current value of the input is '<')**.

To express this precisely:

State: **`mak` is `i+1`, `i` is at least 2, `n` is at least 2, and the input is less than 0 (current value of the input is '<')**.
