Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is defined as `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mak` is `len(pans) + 1`
   - `mak2` is `n - 1`
   - `i` is `len(pans) + 1`
   - `pans` has all indices where the input was `<` and possibly `n` if the input was `=`
   - `s` contains the final input string received
   - `n` is an input integer that must be at least 2
   - `len(pans)` is less than `n`

3. **Analyze the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Update the state**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(pans) + 1`.
   - Since `len(pans)` is less than `n`, `i` is less than `n`.
   - After the loop increments `i` by 1, `i` becomes `len(pans) + 2`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`, so `i` should be `len(pans) + 2` and `n` must still be greater than or equal to `len(pans) + 2`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` changes from `len(pans) + 1` to `len(pans) + 2`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`mak` is `len(pans) + 1`, `mak2` is `n - 1`, `i` is `len(pans) + 2`, `pans` has all indices where the input was `<` and possibly `n` if the input was `=`, `s` contains the final input string received, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 2, and `len(pans)` is less than `n`.**
