Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variables `i` and the range function parameters. Specifically, `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `len(pans) - 1`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition is given as follows:
   - `mak` is 1 if the input string is '>'.
   - Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.
   - `i` is 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `len(pans)`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, if the loop continues, `i` will become 2.
   - The value of `mak` and the condition of the input string remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume no changes to `mak`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `mak` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration (either 1 or 0).
   - `i` becomes 2.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`mak` is 1 if the input string is '>', otherwise `mak` remains 0; `i` is 2**.
