Output State: **`mak` is `k + 1`, `pans` is `[i]`, `i` is `k + 1`, `n` is the same as before the previous iteration**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` to the list `pans`. Given that `i` is `k + 1`, `pans` becomes a list containing the single element `k + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
