Output State: **`mak` is equal to `i`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` must be at least 2.**

Explanation: The code `mak = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `mak`. This does not change the value of `i` itself, so `i` remains incremented by 1 from its previous state. The condition that `n` must be at least 2 is still valid as no code has altered `n`.
