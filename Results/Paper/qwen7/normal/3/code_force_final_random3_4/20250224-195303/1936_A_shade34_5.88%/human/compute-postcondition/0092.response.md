Output State: **`mak` is `i`, `i` must be at least 1, `n` must be at least 2, the input is less than 0 (current value of the input is '<')**

Explanation: The line `mak = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `mak`. The conditions that `i` must be at least 1 and `n` must be at least 2, along with the input being less than 0, remain unchanged.
