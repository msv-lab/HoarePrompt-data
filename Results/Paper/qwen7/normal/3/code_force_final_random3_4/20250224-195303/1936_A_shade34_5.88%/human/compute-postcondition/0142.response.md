Output State: **`mak2` is equal to `mak`, `mak` is either `n-1` or any value between 0 and `n-2`, inclusive, `i` is `i + 1`, `pans` contains `[i]` and the new value of `pans` is `[i, i+1]`, `s` is assigned the value of the input string, and `sys.stdout.flush()` has been called.**

Explanation: The code `pans.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `pans`. Since `pans` previously contained either `[i]` or `[i+1]` (if `s == '<'`), or the element `n` (if `s != '<'`), after appending `i`, `pans` will now contain `[i, i+1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
