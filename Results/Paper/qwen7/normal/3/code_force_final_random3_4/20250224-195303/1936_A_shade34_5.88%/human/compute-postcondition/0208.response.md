Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is at least 2, `s` is a string input by the user, and the string `s` is equal to '=', `pans` is a list with the value `i` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` to the list `pans`. Since `i` is equal to `n` and `n` is at least 2, `pans` now contains the value of `i`. The other variables (`s` and `n`) remain unchanged.
