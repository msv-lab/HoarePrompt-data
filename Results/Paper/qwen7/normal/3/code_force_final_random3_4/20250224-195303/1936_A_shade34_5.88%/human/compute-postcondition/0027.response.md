Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The variable `i` is initialized to `n-1` according to the given state.
   - The variable `n` must be greater than 3 as per the given state.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i` being set to `n-1`, `i` should be one less than `n`.
   - `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute.

Given these points, we need to adjust the states of `i` and `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

**State:**
- `i` must be `n-1`.
- `n` must be greater than 3.

Since `i` is derived from `n`, we can express `i` directly in terms of `n`. Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State:**
**`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 3**
