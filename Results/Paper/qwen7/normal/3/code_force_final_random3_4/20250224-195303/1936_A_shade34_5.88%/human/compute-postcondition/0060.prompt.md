Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `mak2` is 3, `t` must be at least 1, `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is equal to `n-1', and `pans` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
    sys.stdout.flush()
    s = str(input())
    if s == '<':
        mak = i
        pans = [i]
    elif s == '=':
        pans.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` is a string input from the user. If `s` is '<', then `mak` is equal to `i` and `pans` is `[i]`. If `s` is '=', then `pans` contains the value `i`. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged and `pans` retains its original value.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is a new string input from the user. If `s` equals '<', then `mak` is `k + 1`, `pans` is `[i]`, `i` is `k + 1`, and `n` is the same as before the previous iteration. Otherwise, `mak` is undefined, `pans` is a list containing the value `k + 1`, `i` is `k + 1`, and `n` is the same as before the previous iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `s` is a new string input from the user, `mak` is either `k + 1` or undefined, `pans` is a list containing the value `k + 1` and optionally the value `i` if `s` equals '=', `i` is `k + 1`, and `n` is the same as before the previous iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
