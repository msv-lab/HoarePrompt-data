None of the input variables are explicitly defined in the provided function signature. However, based on the problem description, t (the number of test cases) is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, n (the size of the permutation) is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. Additionally, the permutation p is a list of n integers that is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}.
