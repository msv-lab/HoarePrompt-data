Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(1, len(pans)):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `len(pans)`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values**: 
   - `mak` is initially 0.
   - Other variables (`pans`, `mak2`, `t`, `n`, `i`) retain their initial values, but since they are not mentioned in the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if the condition `1 <= i < len(pans)` is satisfied. This means that `len(pans)` must be at least 2 (since `i` starts from 1).

4. **Adjust the States**: 
   - `i` will start from 1, as specified by the range function.
   - `len(pans)` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be 1.
- `len(pans)` must be at least 2.

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`mak` is 0, `i` is 1, `len(pans)` must be at least 2**.
