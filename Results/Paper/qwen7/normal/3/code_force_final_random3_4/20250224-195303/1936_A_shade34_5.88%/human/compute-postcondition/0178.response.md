Based on the initial state provided:

- `mak` is 0.
- `mak2` is `n - 1`.
- `i` is `len(pans)`.
- `pans` contains all indices where the input was `<` and possibly `n` if the input was `=`.
- `s` contains the final input string received.
- `n` is an input integer that must be at least 2.
- `len(pans)` must be less than `n`.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

Let's break down the values being printed:

- `'?'`: This is a literal string and will be printed as is.
- `mak`: According to the initial state, `mak` is 0.
- `mak`: Again, according to the initial state, `mak` is 0.
- `i`: According to the initial state, `i` is `len(pans)`.
- `i`: Again, `i` is `len(pans)`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'? 0 0 len(pans) len(pans)**
