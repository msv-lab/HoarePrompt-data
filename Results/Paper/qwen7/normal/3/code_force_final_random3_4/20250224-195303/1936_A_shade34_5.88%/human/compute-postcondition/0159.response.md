Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the `for i in range(1, len(pans)):` statement. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `len(pans)`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mak` is `n-1`
   - `mak2` is `n-1`
   - `i` is `n-1`
   - `pans` must have at least 2 elements
   - The input string is `'>',` (which means no changes are made to the variables)

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(pans)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is currently `n-1`, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to `n`, which is `i + 1`.
   - `len(pans)` remains unchanged because it is determined by the length of the `pans` list, which does not change within the loop body based on the given information.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `i` will be `n` (or `n-1 + 1`).
   - `pans` must still have at least 2 elements.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`mak` is `n-1`, `mak2` is `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `pans` must have at least 2 elements**
