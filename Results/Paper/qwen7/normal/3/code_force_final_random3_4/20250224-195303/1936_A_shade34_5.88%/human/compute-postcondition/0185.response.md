Based on the initial state provided:

- `mak` is defined as `len(pans) + 1`. This means `mak` is one more than the length of the list `pans`.
- `mak2` is defined as `n - 1`. This means `mak2` is `n` decremented by 1.
- `i` is defined as `len(pans) + 1`. This means `i` is also one more than the length of the list `pans`.
- `pans` is a list containing indices where the input was `<` and possibly `n` if the input was `=`.
- `s` is a string containing the final input received.
- `n` is an integer that must be at least 2.
- `len(pans)` is less than `n`.

Given these definitions, let's break down the `print` statement:

```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

- `'?'` is a string literal that will be printed as is.
- `mak` is `len(pans) + 1`.
- `mak` is repeated, so it will print `len(pans) + 1` twice.
- `i` is `len(pans) + 1`, so it will print `len(pans) + 1` twice.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **'? len(pans) + 1 len(pans) + 1 len(pans) + 1 len(pans) + 1'**
