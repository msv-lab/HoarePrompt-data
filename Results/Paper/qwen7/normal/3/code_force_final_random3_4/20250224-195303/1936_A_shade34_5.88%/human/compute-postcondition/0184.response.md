Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` and the range `1` to `n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `mak` is `i`
   - `mak2` is `n - 1`
   - `i` is `len(pans)`
   - `pans` has all indices where the input was `<` and possibly `n` if the input was `=`
   - `s` contains the final input string received
   - `n` is an input integer that must be at least 2
   - `len(pans)` must be less than `n`
   - The current input is `<`
   - `s` now includes this new input

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop condition is `for i in range(1, n)`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `len(pans)`.
   - Since `len(pans)` must be less than `n` for the loop to continue, `i` (which is `len(pans)`) must be incremented by 1 to be within the range `1` to `n-1`.

5. **Update the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become `len(pans) + 1`.
   - `mak` will be updated to the new value of `i`, which is `len(pans) + 1`.
   - `pans` will remain the same as it does not change within the loop head.
   - `s` will remain the same as it does not change within the loop head.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

6. **Final State**:
   - `mak` is `len(pans) + 1`
   - `mak2` is still `n - 1`
   - `i` is `len(pans) + 1`
   - `pans` has all indices where the input was `<` and possibly `n` if the input was `=`
   - `s` contains the final input string received
   - `n` is an input integer that must be at least 2
   - `len(pans)` must be less than `n`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`mak` is `len(pans) + 1`, `mak2` is `n - 1`, `i` is `len(pans) + 1`, `pans` has all indices where the input was `<` and possibly `n` if the input was `=`, `s` contains the final input string received, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 2, and `len(pans)` must be less than `n`**.
