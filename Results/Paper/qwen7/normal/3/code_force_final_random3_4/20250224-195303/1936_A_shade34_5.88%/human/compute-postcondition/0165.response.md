Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i` and the condition `range(1, len(pans))`.

2. **Determine the initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mak` is `i`
   - `mak2` is `n-1`
   - `i` is `n`
   - `pans` must have at least 2 elements
   - The input string is compared to '>', if the input is '>', the values remain unchanged; otherwise, the values also remain unchanged.

3. **Understand the loop condition**:
   - The loop runs from `1` to `len(pans) - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop starts from `1` and increments `i` by `1` each time, the next value of `i` should be `n + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `len(pans)`.
   - Therefore, `n + 1` must be less than `len(pans)`.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `mak` remains unchanged as it is still equal to the previous value of `i`, which is `n`.
   - `mak2` remains unchanged as it is still equal to `n-1`.
   - `i` is updated to `n + 1`.
   - `pans` must still have at least 2 elements.
   - The input string comparison condition remains unchanged.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`mak` is `n`, `mak2` is `n-1`, `i` is `n + 1`, `pans` must have at least 2 elements, and the input string is compared to '>', if the input is '>', the values remain unchanged; otherwise, the values also remain unchanged.**
