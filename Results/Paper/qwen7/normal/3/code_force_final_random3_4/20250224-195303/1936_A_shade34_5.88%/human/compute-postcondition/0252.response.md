Output State: **`i` is 3, `mak` is 3, `pans` is a list containing all integers from `n` to `2n - 1` inclusive.**

Explanation: The code `mak = i` assigns the current value of `i` (which is 3) to the variable `mak`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 3, and the list `pans` stays the same as it was in the initial state.
