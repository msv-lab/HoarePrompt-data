Based on the initial state provided:

- `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
- `mak` is either `n-1` or any value between 0 and `n-2`, inclusive.
- `i` is `n`.
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `pans` is an empty list.

We need to determine the values that will be printed by the statement `print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)`.

1. `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
2. `mak` can be any value from 0 to `n-2` or `n-1`.
3. `i` is directly assigned the value of `n`.
4. `mak2` is again the same as `mak`.

Given these conditions, let's break down the print statement:

- The first argument is a string `'?'`.
- The second argument is `mak`.
- The third argument is `mak2`, which is equal to `mak`.
- The fourth argument is `i`, which is `n`.
- The fifth argument is `mak2`, which is again equal to `mak`.

Since `mak` can be any value from 0 to `n-2` or `n-1`, and `i` is `n`, the output will include a string and the value of `mak` repeated twice, followed by `n`.

Output: **'? [mak] [mak] [n] [mak]** (where `[mak]` is the value of `mak` and `[n]` is the value of `n`)
