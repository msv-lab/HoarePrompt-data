Output State: **`mak` is 0; `i` is equal to the length of `pans` after the next iteration; `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The line `mak = 0` sets the variable `mak` to 0. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `i` is still equal to the length of `pans` after the next iteration, and `n` remains an input integer.
