Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. According to the problem description, the goal is to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally. However, the program calculates a value based on the input using a formula that does not relate to the game's rules or the winning condition.

The formula used in the program is:
\[ \text{sum}((3 * (x // 2) + x \% 2 * (i < 3) \text{ for } (i, x) \text{ in enumerate(map(int, input().split()))})) // 3 \]

This formula does not consider the bitwise XOR of the sequence or the optimal strategy for Eve to maximize Bob's wins. Instead, it appears to be a heuristic that does not reflect the actual game logic.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to simulate the game or calculate the maximum number of Bob's wins based on the initial counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s. The current implementation does not achieve this.
