Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer input from the user, and `s` is a string consisting of '110' repeated `n//2` times with a length of either less than 200 or exactly 200.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state of `t` and `s` remains unchanged. Therefore, `t` must still be greater than 0, `n` now holds the integer input from the user, and `s` is a string consisting of '110' repeated `n//2` times with a length of either less than 200 or exactly 200.
