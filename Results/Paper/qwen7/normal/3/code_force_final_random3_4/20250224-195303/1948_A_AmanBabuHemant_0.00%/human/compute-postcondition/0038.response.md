Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes two integers, `t` and `n`, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, but these integers are not passed directly to the function. Instead, the function returns based on the conditions that `t` is between 1 and 50 inclusive, and `n` is between 1 and 50 inclusive.**

However, since the function definition itself does not accept any parameters (`def func():`), the parameters `t` and `n` must be derived from some external source or context not shown in the provided code snippet. The function checks if `t` and `n` meet the specified constraints and returns based on these conditions.
