Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, and if `n` is odd, `t` remains unchanged. If `n` is even, `n` is an even input integer, and `s` is '110110...110' (repeated `n//2` times). If the length of `s` is less than 200, no changes are made. If the length of `s` is 200 or more, no additional changes are made as well.
