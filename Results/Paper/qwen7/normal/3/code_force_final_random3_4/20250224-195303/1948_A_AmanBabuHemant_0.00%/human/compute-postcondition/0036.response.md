Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer input from the user, and `s` is a string consisting of '110' repeated `n//2` times with a length of either less than 200 or exactly 200. Since both the if and else parts do not change the values of `t`, `n`, or `s`, the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
