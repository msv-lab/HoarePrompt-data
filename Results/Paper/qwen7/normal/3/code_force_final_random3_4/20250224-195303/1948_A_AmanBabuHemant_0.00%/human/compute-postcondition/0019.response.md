Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 1.
- `n` is an integer input from the user.
- If `n` is even, `s` is '110110...110' repeated `n//2` times with a length of either less than 200 or exactly 200.

The `print('NO')` statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, or `s`. It simply prints the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
