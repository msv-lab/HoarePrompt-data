Output State: **`rev_val` is an empty list, `y` is `n`, `max_power` is the second input value, `list_len` is the first input value.**

Explanation: The code splits the input into two parts using the `split()` function, assigning the first part to `list_len` and the second part to `max_power`. The `rev_val` list and `y` variable remain unchanged from their initial states.
