Output State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least two elements, `x` is the first element of `operational_list` reversed as an integer, `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reversed string of the first element of `operational_list` and `x_rev` is calculated as the integer representation of the reverse of `x`.**

This means that the first element of `operational_list`, when reversed and converted to an integer, is stored in `x_rev`. The other elements of `operational_list` remain unchanged, and `x` remains the original first element of `operational_list` but reversed and converted to an integer.
