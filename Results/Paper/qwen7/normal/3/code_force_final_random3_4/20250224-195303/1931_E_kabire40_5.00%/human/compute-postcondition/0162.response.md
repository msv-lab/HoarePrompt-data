Postcondition: **`operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least three elements, `rev_val` is a sorted list of the reversed integers of the reversed strings in `operational_list` whose reverse does not have the same length as the original string, `rev_res` is the sum of all integers in `rev_val` plus the integer value of the last element of `operational_list` if its reverse has the same length as the original string, otherwise it includes the reversed integer of the last element, `y` remains 1, and `rev_res` reflects the final accumulated value after processing each element in `rev_val` according to the given conditions, and \(10^{int(max_power)}\) is less than or equal to `int(rev_res)`**
