Postcondition: **`operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least two elements, `x` is the second element of `operational_list` reversed as an integer, `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reversed string of the second element of `operational_list`, `x_rev` is calculated as the integer representation of the reversed string of `x`. If the length of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, `rev_res` is incremented by `x`. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x` as an integer.**
