Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least three elements, `rev_val` is a sorted list of the reversed integers of the strings in `operational_list` whose reverse does not have the same length as the original string, `rev_res` is the sum of all integers in `rev_val` plus the integer value of the last element of `operational_list` if its reverse has the same length as the original string, otherwise it includes the reversed integer of the last element, and `y` remains 1.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(len(rev_val)):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        val_in = int(rev_val[x])
        rev_res += str(val_in)
    else:
        val_in = rev_val[x]
        rev_res += val_in[::-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least three elements, `rev_val` is a sorted list of the reversed integers of the reversed strings in `operational_list` whose reverse does not have the same length as the original string, `rev_res` is the sum of all integers in `rev_val` plus the integer value of the last element of `operational_list` if its reverse has the same length as the original string, otherwise it includes the reversed integer of the last element, `y` remains 1, and `rev_res` is increased by either the value of the first element of `rev_val` (if `x` is even) or the reverse of the first element of `rev_val` (if `x` is odd).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least three elements, `rev_val` is a sorted list of the reversed integers of the reversed strings in `operational_list` whose reverse does not have the same length as the original string, `rev_res` is the sum of all integers in `rev_val` plus the integer value of the last element of `operational_list` if its reverse has the same length as the original string, otherwise it includes the reversed integer of the last element, `y` remains 1, `x` is `x + 1`, and `rev_res` is updated by adding either `str(val_in)` or the reverse of `val_in` to it, where `val_in` is the integer value of the current element in `rev_val` based on the condition of the if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least three elements, `rev_val` is a sorted list of the reversed integers of the reversed strings in `operational_list` whose reverse does not have the same length as the original string, `rev_res` is the sum of all integers in `rev_val` plus the integer value of the last element of `operational_list` if its reverse has the same length as the original string, otherwise it includes the reversed integer of the last element, `y` remains 1, `x` is either `previous_x + 1` or `x + 1`, and `rev_res` is updated by adding the integer value of the current reversed string to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
