Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `rev_val` is a sorted list of the reversed strings from `operational_list` where the length of the reversed string matches the original string, and `rev_res` is the sum of those integers.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(len(rev_val)):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        val_in = int(rev_val[x])
        rev_res += str(val_in)
    else:
        val_in = rev_val[x]
        rev_res += val_in[::-1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `rev_res` is the sum of the integers in `rev_val` with the additional value of either the integer value of `rev_val[x]` (if `x` is even) or the reversed integer value of `rev_val[x]` (if `x` is odd).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `rev_res` is the sum of the integers in `rev_val` with the additional value of either the integer value of `rev_val[x+1]` (if `x+1` is even) or the reversed integer value of `rev_val[x+1]` (if `x+1` is odd). `rev_val` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration. `x` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration. If `x % 2 == 0`, `rev_res` is concatenated with the string representation of `val_in`, where `val_in` is the integer value of `rev_val[x]`. Otherwise, `rev_res` is updated by adding the reverse of `val_in`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `rev_res` is the sum of the integers in `rev_val` with the additional value of either the integer value of `rev_val[x+1]` (if `(x+1) % 2 == 0`) or the reversed integer value of `rev_val[x+1]` (if `(x+1) % 2 != 0`), added to a string version of `rev_res`; `rev_val` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration; `x` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `val_in` is assigned the integer value of `rev_val[x]` with each digit reversed if the condition is false, or the integer value of `rev_val[x]` if the condition is true.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
