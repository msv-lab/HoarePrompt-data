Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `x` and `operational_list`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `operational_list`. The loop will continue as long as there are elements left in `operational_list`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least two elements.
   - `x` is the second element of `operational_list` reversed as an integer.
   - `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reversed string of the second element of `operational_list`.
   - `x_rev` is calculated as the integer representation of the reversed string of `x`.
   - If the length of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, `rev_res` is incremented by `x`.
   - Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x` as an integer.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `operational_list`, the next element in `operational_list` will be processed.
   - The previous `x` (which was the second element) will now be the first element for the next iteration.
   - Therefore, the new `x` will be the first element of `operational_list` reversed as an integer.
   - `x_rev` will be the integer representation of the reversed string of the first element of `operational_list`.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `operational_list` still contains at least two elements.
   - `x` will now be the first element of `operational_list` reversed as an integer.
   - `x_rev` will be the integer representation of the reversed string of the first element of `operational_list`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least two elements, `x` is the first element of `operational_list` reversed as an integer, `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reversed string of the first element of `operational_list`**.
