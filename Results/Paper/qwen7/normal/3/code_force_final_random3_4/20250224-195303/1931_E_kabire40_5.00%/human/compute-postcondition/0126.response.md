Output State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least two elements, `x` is the second element of `operational_list` reversed as an integer, `x_rev` is the integer representation of the reversed string of the second element of `operational_list`, `x_rev` is calculated as the integer representation of the reversed string of `x`, and `rev_res` is equal to `rev_res + x`.**

Explanation: The code `rev_res = rev_res + x` adds the value of `x` (which is the integer representation of the reversed second element of `operational_list`) to `rev_res`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `rev_res`, it remains as `rev_res` plus the value of `x`. All other variables retain their initial conditions.
