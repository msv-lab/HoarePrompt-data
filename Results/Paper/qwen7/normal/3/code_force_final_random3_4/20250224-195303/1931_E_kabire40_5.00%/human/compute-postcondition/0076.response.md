Output State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings, `x` is the next string in the list, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of `x`, `rev_res` is unchanged, and `rev_val` is the list with the reversed string of `x` appended.**

Explanation: The code `rev_val.append(x[::-1])` appends the reverse of the string `x` to the list `rev_val`. The other variables remain unchanged. The reverse of `x` is calculated using `x[::-1]`, which reverses the string `x`.
