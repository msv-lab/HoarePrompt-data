Output State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings, `x` is the first string in the list reversed and converted to an integer and appended to `rev_val`, `rev_val` contains the reversed and integer-converted first string of `operational_list`.**

Explanation: The code appends the reverse of the first string in `operational_list` (which is `x`) to `rev_val` after converting it to an integer. The other elements in `operational_list` and the value of `x` remain unchanged.
