Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 0 ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^6; the list a contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for y in range(int(input())):
    rev_val = []
    rev_res = ''
    list_len, max_power = input().split()
    operational_list = input().split()
    for x in operational_list:
        x_rev = int(x[::-1])
        if len(str(x_rev)) == len(x):
            rev_res = rev_res + x
        else:
            rev_val.append(x[::-1])
    rev_val.sort()
    for x in range(len(rev_val)):
        if x % 2 == 0:
            val_in = int(rev_val[x])
            rev_res += str(val_in)
        else:
            val_in = rev_val[x]
            rev_res += val_in[::-1]
    if 10 ** int(max_power) < int(rev_res):
        print('Sasha')
    else:
        print('Anna')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The final value of `rev_res` is a string that alternates between the integer values of `rev_val` and their reversed forms, starting with the first element of `rev_val` and ending with its last element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The final value of `rev_res` will be the sum of all integers in `rev_val` plus the concatenation of the integer value of `rev_val[x]` (if `x` is even) or the reversed integer value of `rev_val[x]` (if `x` is odd) for each iteration from `x = 0` to `x = len(rev_val) - 1`. Additionally, if `rev_res` is greater than \(10^{\text{int(max_power)}}\), this condition holds; otherwise, `rev_res` is less than or equal to \(10^{\text{int(max_power)}}\).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `operational_list` is a list of strings that must contain at least three elements, `rev_val` is a sorted list of the reversed integers of the reversed strings in `operational_list` whose reverse does not have the same length as the original string, `rev_res` is the sum of all integers in `rev_val` plus the integer value of the last element of `operational_list` if its reverse has the same length as the original string, otherwise it includes the reversed integer of the last element, `y` remains 1, and `rev_res` reflects the final accumulated value after processing each element in `rev_val` according to the given conditions.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
