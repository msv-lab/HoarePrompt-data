Postcondition: **`operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least two strings. If the length of the reverse of the string `x` (denoted as `str(x_rev)`) is equal to the length of `x`, then `rev_res` is updated by adding `x` to it, where `x` is the integer value of the reverse of the string `x`. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reverse of the string `x`.**
