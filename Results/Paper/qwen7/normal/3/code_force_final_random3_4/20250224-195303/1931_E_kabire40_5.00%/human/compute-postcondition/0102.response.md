Postcondition: **`rev_res` is the sum of the integers in `rev_val` with the additional value of either the integer value of `rev_val[x+1]` (if `(x+1) % 2 == 0`) or the reversed integer value of `rev_val[x+1]` (if `(x+1) % 2 != 0`), added to a string version of `rev_res`; `rev_val` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration; `x` is incremented by 1 from its value at the end of the previous iteration; `val_in` is assigned the integer value of `rev_val[x]` with each digit reversed if the condition is false, or the integer value of `rev_val[x]` if the condition is true.**
