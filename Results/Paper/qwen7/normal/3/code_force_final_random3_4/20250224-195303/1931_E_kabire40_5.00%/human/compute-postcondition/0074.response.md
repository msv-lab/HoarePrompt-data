Output State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings, `x` is the next string in the list, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reverse of `x`, `rev_res` is unchanged, and `rev_val` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `x_rev = int(x[::-1])` takes the string `x`, reverses it using slicing (`x[::-1]`), and converts the reversed string to an integer. This operation changes the value of `x_rev`. The other variables remain unchanged.
