Output State: **`operational_list` is a list of strings that must have at least three strings, `x` is the first string in the list reversed and converted to an integer, denoted as `x_rev`, `rev_res` is equal to `rev_res` plus `x_rev`.**

Explanation: The code `rev_res = rev_res + x` adds the value of `x` (which is the first string in the list reversed and converted to an integer) to `rev_res`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `rev_res`, it remains as `rev_res` plus the value of `x_rev`. The operational list and the fact that `x` is the first string in the list reversed and converted to an integer remain unchanged.
