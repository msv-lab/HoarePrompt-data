Postcondition: `arr` is a list of tuples, where each tuple is of the form (start_index, end_index, value), indicating segments of consecutive identical elements in the list `nums`. The last element in `arr` is updated to reflect the end of the last segment, and `LA` is set to the length of `arr` minus one. The current value of `ppp` is 23.
