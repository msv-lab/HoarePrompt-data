Output State: **`num` is equal to `nums[i]`, `i` is equal to `s + 1`, `s` is equal to `i`, and `arr` contains a new tuple `(2 + s, i, num)`**.

Explanation: The code `num = nums[i]` simply assigns the value of `nums[i]` to the variable `num`. All other variables (`i`, `s`, and `arr`) remain unchanged from their previous states. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the additional information that `num` now holds the value of `nums[i]`.
