Output State: **`num` is equal to `nums[i]`, `i` is equal to `s + 1` if incremented or `s` if not, and `i` must be less than or equal to `N`; `arr` contains a new tuple `(1 + s, i, num)`**.

This means that the list `arr` now includes a new tuple with the values `(1 + s, i, num)`. The values of `num` and `i` remain as they were before, and `i` still needs to be less than or equal to `N`.
