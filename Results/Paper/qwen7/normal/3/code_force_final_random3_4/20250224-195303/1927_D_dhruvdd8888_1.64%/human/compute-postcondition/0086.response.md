Based on the initial state provided:

- `ppp` is explicitly given as 23.
- `l` and `r` are integers obtained from input, but their specific values are not provided.
- `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted into `arr` to keep it sorted.
- `s`, `e`, and `_` are assigned values from `arr[min(eli, LA)]` or `arr[max(eli, LA)]` depending on the condition `s > l`.

However, the `print(-1, -1)` statement does not depend on the values of `l`, `r`, `eli`, `s`, `e`, or `_`. It directly prints `-1` twice.

Output: **-1, -1**
