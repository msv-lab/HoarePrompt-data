Based on the initial state provided:

- `ppp` is explicitly given as 23.
- `l` and `r` are integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers. Since their values are not specified, we will keep them as `l` and `r`.
- `arr` is a list, but its contents are not specified. We need to determine the values of `s`, `e`, and `_` from the tuple at the index determined by `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`.
- `s`, `e`, and `_` are assigned the values from the tuple at the index determined by `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`.

Since the exact values of `l`, `r`, `arr`, `eli`, and `LA` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `s`, `e`, and `_`. However, we can describe the output based on the structure of the problem.

The print statement `print(s, e + 1)` will print the values of `s` and `e + 1` from the tuple at the index determined by `min(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`.

Output: **s, e + 1 (where s and e are elements from the tuple at the index determined by min(eli, LA) in the list arr)**
