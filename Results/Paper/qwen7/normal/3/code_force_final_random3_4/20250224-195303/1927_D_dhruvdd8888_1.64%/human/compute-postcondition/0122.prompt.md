You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i is in the range 1 <= a_i <= 10^6; q is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5; each query is represented by two integers l and r such that 1 <= l < r <= n.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = 0
    e = 0
    num = nums[0]
    arr = []
    nums.append(-1)
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if nums[i] != num:
            arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
            s = i
        
        num = nums[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `arr` will contain tuples representing the start and end indices along with the value of `num` for each segment of consecutive identical elements in the list `nums`. Specifically, `arr` will include a tuple for every change in the value of `num` within the list `nums`, starting from the index `s` up to `N`.
    #
    #In more detail, `arr` will be a list of tuples, where each tuple is of the form `(start_index, end_index, value)`, indicating that the value `value` was encountered in the list `nums` from index `start_index` to `end_index - 1`. The loop iterates through the entire list `nums` (from index 0 to `N`), and whenever it encounters a different value than the current `num`, it appends a new tuple to `arr` with the current start index (`s`), the current index (`i`), and the value of `num` before the change. After appending, it updates `s` to the current index `i` and sets `num` to the new value found at index `i`. This process continues until the loop completes all iterations over `nums`.
    LA = len(arr) - 1
    if (ppp == 23) :
        print(nums)
        #This is printed: [value1, value1, ..., valueN]
    #State: Postcondition: `arr` is a list of tuples, where each tuple is of the form (start_index, end_index, value), indicating segments of consecutive identical elements in the list `nums`. The last element in `arr` is updated to reflect the end of the last segment, and `LA` is set to the length of `arr` minus one. The current value of `ppp` is 23.
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if tc > 5:
            if ppp == 23:
                print(l, r)
            continue
        
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        
        s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
        
        if s > l:
            if s == 1:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(s - 1, s)
        elif e >= r:
            print(-1, -1)
        elif e < N:
            print(s, e + 1)
        else:
            print(-1, -1)
        
    #State: The loop will run until the user inputs a number greater than 5 for `tc`. Since the initial value of `ppp` is 23 and it is not modified within the loop, `ppp` will remain 23 after all iterations. The values of `l` and `r` will be the last pair of integers entered by the user during the loop. The variables `eli`, `s`, `e`, and `_` will be determined based on the last iteration's conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a predefined set of variables: an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4), an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), a list `a` of `n` integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^6) where each integer `a_i` is in the specified range, an integer `q` (1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5), and a series of queries represented by pairs of integers `l` and `r` (1 <= l < r <= n). The function returns results based on these inputs, likely involving processing the list `a` within the given ranges `l` to `r` for each query.
