Output State: The loop will execute `N + 1` times. After all iterations, `arr` will contain tuples representing the start and end indices of segments in `nums` where the elements are the same. Specifically, each tuple in `arr` will be of the form `(start_index, end_index, value)`, indicating that the segment from `start_index` to `end_index - 1` (inclusive) in `nums` contains the value `value`. The variable `s` will be set to `N`, and `e` will be set to `N + 1`. The variable `num` will be equal to `nums[N]` since the loop increments `i` up to `N` and sets `num` to `nums[i]` at each step. The variable `i` will be `N + 1` after the loop exits because the loop runs from `0` to `N` inclusive, and then `i` is incremented one more time outside the loop.

In summary, `arr` will contain all the segments where consecutive elements in `nums` are the same, `s` and `e` will both be `N`, and `num` will be the last element of `nums`.
