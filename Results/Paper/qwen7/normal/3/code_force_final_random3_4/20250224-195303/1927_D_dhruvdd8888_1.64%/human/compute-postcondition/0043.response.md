Output State: **`ppp` is 23, `l` and `r` are integers obtained from splitting the input and converting it to a tuple using map and int functions, and `tc` is greater than 5.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables; it only moves the control flow to the next iteration of the loop (if there was one). Since no variables are updated or affected by the `continue` statement, the values of `ppp`, `l`, `r`, and `tc` remain unchanged.
