Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `ppp` is 23.
   - `l` and `r` are integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.
   - `eli` is the index where `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to keep the list `arr` sorted.
   - `s`, `e`, and `_` are assigned the values from either `arr[min(eli, LA)]` or `arr[max(eli, LA)]` depending on the condition `s > l`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(s, e + 1)
   ```

Given the initial state, we need to determine the values of `s` and `e + 1`:

- `s` and `e` are derived from the element at index `min(eli, LA)` or `max(eli, LA)` in the list `arr`.
- Since `s > l`, the value of `s` is taken from `arr[max(eli, LA)]`.
- The value of `e` is the same as `s` because they are derived from the same element in `arr`.

Therefore, the print statement will output `s` followed by `e + 1`.

Since the exact values of `l`, `r`, `arr`, `eli`, and `LA` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `s` and `e`. However, we know that `s` and `e` are derived from the same element in `arr` and `e + 1` will be one more than `s`.

Output: **s, s + 1 (where s is the value derived from arr[max(eli, LA)] and e is the same as s)**
