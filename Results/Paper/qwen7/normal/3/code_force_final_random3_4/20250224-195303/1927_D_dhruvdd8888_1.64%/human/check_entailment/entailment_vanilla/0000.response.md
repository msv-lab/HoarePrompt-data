Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Setting Up Test Cases:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N`, the array itself, and the number of queries `q`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It processes the array to identify segments where the value changes.
   - Specifically, it identifies segments where the value of the array changes and stores these segments in the `arr` list.

3. **Handling Segments:**
   - The program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate segment for each query.
   - For each query, it checks if the segment starts before the left boundary `l` and ends after the right boundary `r`.
   - If the segment starts before `l`, it prints the indices of the start and end of the previous segment.
   - If the segment ends after `r`, it prints `-1 -1`.
   - If the segment is within the boundaries, it prints the start and end of the segment.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Identifying Segments:**
   - The program correctly identifies segments where the value changes in the array.
   - However, the way it handles the segments might not always be optimal. For example, if there are multiple consecutive elements with the same value, the program will treat them as a single segment.

2. **Query Handling:**
   - The program uses binary search to find the appropriate segment for each query.
   - It checks if the segment starts before the left boundary `l` and ends after the right boundary `r`.
   - This logic seems correct but needs to handle edge cases properly.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles some edge cases (like when `s == 1` and `e == N`) correctly.
   - However, it might miss some cases where the segment is exactly at the boundaries.

### Example Verification

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

```plaintext

1 5
1 2
1 3

```

The expected output matches the provided solution. The program correctly identifies segments and handles queries as required.
