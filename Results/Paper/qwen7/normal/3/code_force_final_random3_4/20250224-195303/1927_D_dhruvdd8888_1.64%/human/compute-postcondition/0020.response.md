Output State: **`num` is equal to `nums[i]`, `i` is equal to `s`, and `i` is either incremented by 1 or remains the same depending on whether `nums[i]` is equal to `num`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `nums[i]` to `num`. This means that `num` is now equal to `nums[i]`. Additionally, since `s` was previously set to `i`, `s` remains unchanged. The condition that if `nums[i]` is not equal to `num`, then `i` is incremented by 1, is now checked. However, since `num` is assigned the value of `nums[i]`, the condition `nums[i] != num` is false, and thus `i` does not change. Therefore, the output state reflects these changes.
