### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the minimum number of new problems Vlad needs to create to ensure that he can hold `m` rounds, given that he already has `n` problems with specified difficulty levels.
   - The difficulty levels are represented by characters 'A' to 'G'.
   - For each test case, we need to count how many problems of each difficulty level are available and calculate the shortfall for each level across all `m` rounds.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes a dictionary `d` using `defaultdict` but does not specify what `default_value` is. This is problematic because `default_value` is not defined.
   - It reads `n` and `m` from the input and the string `s` representing the difficulty levels of the existing problems.
   - It populates the dictionary `d` with the counts of each difficulty level.
   - It calculates the total number of new problems needed by checking how many times each difficulty level is required (`m`) and subtracting the current count from `d`. If the count is less than `m`, it adds the difference to `ans`.

3. **Identifying Issues:**
   - The primary issue is the use of `default_value` without defining it. This will cause a `NameError` when running the code.
   - Additionally, the logic for calculating the shortfall is flawed. It assumes that each difficulty level must be present at least `m` times, which is not necessarily true. Instead, we need to check the shortfall for each difficulty level across all `m` rounds.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - For each difficulty level, we need to calculate how many times it appears in the string `s`.
   - We then determine the shortfall for each difficulty level by comparing its count to `m`.
   - The total number of new problems needed is the sum of these shortfalls.

5. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1()` is irrelevant to the main logic and does not affect the correctness of the program.

6. **Corrected Logic:**
   - We should initialize the dictionary correctly and then calculate the shortfall for each difficulty level.
   - The corrected code should look like this:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    d = defaultdict(int)  # Correctly initialize with default value 0
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    for i in range(n):
        d[s[i]] += 1
    ans = 0
    for val in 'ABCDEFG':
        if d[val] < m:
            ans += m - d[val]
    print(ans)
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identified the issues with the code, particularly the undefined `default_value` and the flawed logic for calculating the shortfall. However, the original assessment did not provide a corrected version of the code, which is necessary to fully address the problem.

Given the corrected logic and the fact that the original code had significant flaws, the correctness of the provided program is:

**Correctness: False**

However, with the corrections applied, the program would be correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
