Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is the integer value of the first space-separated token from the next line `s`, `x` is an integer greater than `k - 3`, `a` is the integer value of the third space-separated token from the next line `s`, `z` is `k - 1` and `z` is increased by `z // (k - 1) + 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `z` is initially equal to `k - 2`. After executing `z += z // (k - 1) + 1`, `z` is updated to its current value plus the integer division of `z` by `(k - 1)` plus 1. Since `z` was initially `k - 2`, the new value of `z` becomes `(k - 2) + ((k - 2) // (k - 1)) + 1`. Given that `(k - 2) // (k - 1)` is 0 (since `k - 2` is less than `k - 1`), the new value of `z` simplifies to `k - 2 + 0 + 1`, which is `k - 1`. Therefore, `z` is now `k - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
