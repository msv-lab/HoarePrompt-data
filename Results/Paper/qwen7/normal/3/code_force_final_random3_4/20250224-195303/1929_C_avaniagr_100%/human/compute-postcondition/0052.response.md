Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is the integer value of the first space-separated token from the next line `s`, `x` is the integer value of the second space-separated token from the next line `s`, `a` is the integer value of the third space-separated token from the next line `s`, `z` is `k - 2`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `k - 2` to the variable `z`. The values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
