Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `k` is the integer value of the first space-separated token from the next line `s`.
- `x` is an integer greater than or equal to `k - 3`.
- `a` is the integer value of the third space-separated token from the next line `s`.
- `z` is computed as `k - 1` plus the sum of `z // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration from 1 to `x - k + 2`.

The print statement is simply `print('NO')`.

Since the print statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`, regardless of the values of the other variables, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
