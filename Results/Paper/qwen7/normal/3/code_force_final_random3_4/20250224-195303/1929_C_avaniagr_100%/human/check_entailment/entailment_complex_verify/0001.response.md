### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the provided examples.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads input from standard input (file `0`).
   - It processes each test case one by one.

2. **Parsing Input:**
   - For each test case, it reads a line and splits it into three integers \( k \), \( x \), and \( a \).

3. **Conditions Based on \( x \):**
   - The program checks the value of \( x \) relative to \( k - 1 \):
     - If \( x < k - 1 \):
       - If \( a \geq x + 1 \), it prints 'YES'.
       - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
     - If \( x = k - 1 \):
       - If \( a \geq x + 2 \), it prints 'YES'.
       - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
     - If \( x > k - 1 \):
       - It calculates a variable \( z \) using a loop.
       - It checks if \( a \geq z \):
         - If true, it prints 'YES'.
         - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

4. **Calculation of \( z \):**
   - The calculation of \( z \) involves a loop where \( z \) is updated iteratively:
     ```python
     z = k - 2
     for i in range(x - k + 3):
         z += z // (k - 1) + 1
     ```
   - This loop seems to be an attempt to calculate a value that represents the minimum number of coins needed to ensure Sasha can eventually win any number of coins.

#### Verification Against Examples

Let's verify the logic against the provided examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - \( k = 2 \), \( x = 1 \), \( a = 7 \)
   - \( x < k - 1 \) (since \( 1 < 1 \))
   - \( a \geq x + 1 \) (since \( 7 \geq 2 \))
   - Output: 'YES' (Correct)

2. **Example 2:**
   - \( k = 2 \), \( x = 1 \), \( a = 1 \)
   - \( x < k - 1 \) (since \( 1 < 1 \))
   - \( a < x + 1 \) (since \( 1 < 2 \))
   - Output: 'NO' (Correct)

3. **Example 3:**
   - \( k = 2 \), \( x = 3 \), \( a = 15 \)
   - \( x > k - 1 \) (since \( 3 > 1 \))
   - Calculating \( z \):
     - \( z = 2 - 2 = 0 \)
     - Loop: \( z = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 \)
     - \( z = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \)
     - \( z = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5 \)
     - \( z = 5 + 1 + 1 = 7 \)
     - \( z = 7 + 1 + 1 = 9 \)
     - \( z = 9 + 1 + 1 = 11 \)
     - \( z = 11 + 1 + 1 = 13 \)
     - \( z = 13 + 1 + 1 = 15 \)
   - \( a \geq z \) (since \( 15 \geq 15 \))
   - Output: 'YES' (Correct)

4. **Example 4:**
   - \( k = 3 \), \( x = 3 \), \( a = 6 \)
   - \( x = k - 1 \) (since \( 3 = 2 \))
   - \( a < x + 2 \) (since \( 6 < 5 \))
   - Output: 'NO' (Correct)

5. **Example 5:**
   - \( k = 4 \), \( x = 4 \), \( a = 5 \)
   - \( x = k - 1 \) (since \( 4 = 3 \))
   - \( a < x + 2 \) (since \( 5 < 6 \))
   - Output: 'NO' (Correct)

6. **Example 6:**
   - \( k = 5 \), \( x = 4 \), \( a = 7 \)
   - \( x = k - 1 \) (since \( 4 = 4 \))
   - \( a \geq x + 2 \) (since \( 7 \geq 6 \))
   - Output: 'YES' (Correct)

7. **Example 7:**
   - \( k = 5 \), \( x = 88 \), \( a = 1000000000 \)
   - \( x > k - 1 \) (since \( 88 > 4 \))
   - Calculating \( z \):
     - \( z = 5 - 2 = 3 \)
     - Loop: \( z = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7 \)
     - \( z = 7 + 7 + 1 = 15 \)
     - \( z = 15 + 15 + 1 = 31 \)
     - ...
     - Eventually, \( z \) will be much larger than \( 1000000000 \), so \( a \geq z \) is false.
   - Output: 'NO' (Correct)

8. **Example 8:**
   - \( k = 25 \), \( x = 69 \), \( a = 231 \)
   - \( x > k - 1 \) (since \( 69 > 24 \))
   - Calculating \( z \):
     - \( z = 25 - 2 = 23 \)
     - Loop: \( z = 23 + 23 + 1 = 47 \)
     - \( z = 47 + 47 + 1 = 95 \)
     - ...
     - Eventually, \( z \) will be much larger than \( 231 \), so \( a \geq z \) is false.
   - Output: 'NO' (Correct)

9. **Example 9:**
   - \( k = 13 \), \( x = 97 \), \( a = 18806 \)
   - \( x > k - 1 \) (since \( 97 > 12 \))
   - Calculating \( z \):
     - \( z = 13 - 2 = 11 \)
     - Loop: \( z = 11 + 11 + 1 = 23 \)
     - \( z = 23 + 23 + 1 = 47 \)
     - ...
     - Eventually, \( z \) will be much larger than \( 18806 \), so \( a \geq z \) is false.
   - Output: 'NO' (Correct)
