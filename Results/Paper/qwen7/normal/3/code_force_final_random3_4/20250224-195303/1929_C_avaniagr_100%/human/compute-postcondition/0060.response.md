Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `k` is the integer value of the first space-separated token from the next line `s`, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to `k - 3`, `a` is the integer value of the third space-separated token from the next line `s`, `z` is `k - 1` plus the sum of `z // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration from 1 to `x - k + 3`.

To understand this final state, let's break it down:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- `k` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `x` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `z` starts at `k - 1` and then increases by `z // (k - 1) + 1` for each iteration of the loop. Since the loop runs `x - k + 3` times, `z` will be incremented this many times. Therefore, `z` will be `k - 1` plus the sum of `z // (k - 1) + 1` for each of these iterations.
