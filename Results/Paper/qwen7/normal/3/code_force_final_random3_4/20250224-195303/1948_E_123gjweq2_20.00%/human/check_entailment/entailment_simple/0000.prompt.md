Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

for case in testcases:
    (n, k) = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    func_1(n, k)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 40, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2n, and the function `make_array` is defined elsewhere to fill the array `arr` based on the given parameters.
def func_1(n, k):
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n

    #State: Output State: `cliques` must be at least 1, `i` equals `cliques`, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 40\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 2n\), `arr` is a list of `n` zeros, `cliquess` is a list of `n` zeros, `arr` is updated to contain values from `0 * k` to `min((cliques) * k - 1, n - 1)` inclusive, with a length of `cliques`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `cliques` will still be at least 1, `i` will now be equal to the final value of `cliques`, `n` will remain within the range of 2 to 40, `k` will stay within the range of 1 to 2n, `arr` will still be a list of `n` zeros, and `cliquess` will also remain a list of `n` zeros. The `arr` list will be updated to include values starting from `0 * k` up to the minimum of `(cliques * k - 1)` and `n - 1`, with the length of this segment being equal to `cliques`.
    print(*arr)
    #This is printed: [0, 10, ..., min((cliques * k - 1), n - 1)] (where the list starts from 0 * k and ends at the minimum of (cliques * k - 1) and n - 1, with a total of cliques elements)
    print(cliques)
    #This is printed: cliques (where cliques is at least 1)

    #This is printed: 0 0 0 ... 0 (n times)

    #State: Output State: All elements in `arr` from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` are set to values starting from `small_element` and incrementing by 1 for each subsequent index. The corresponding elements in `cliquess` from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` are all set to `clique`. The variable `i` will be equal to `mid - 1` after the loop finishes, and both `left` and `right` will retain their original values.
    #
    #In more detail:
    #- `arr[left]` to `arr[left + mid - 1]` will contain the sequence of integers starting from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1`.
    #- `cliquess[left]` to `cliquess[left + mid - 1]` will all be set to `clique`.
    #- The loop variable `i` will be `mid - 1` after the loop completes.
    #- The variables `left`, `right`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid` will retain their initial or updated values from before the loop started, but no further changes will occur within the loop itself.
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique
        
    #State: Output State: The array `arr` from index `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1` will contain the sequence of integers starting from `big_element - (not_mid - 1)` to `big_element - 1`. The corresponding elements in `cliquess` from index `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1` will all be set to `clique`. The variable `i` will be equal to `not_mid` after the loop finishes, and both `left`, `right`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid` will retain their original values from before the loop started.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the elements in `arr` from `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1` will be filled with decreasing values starting from `big_element - 1` down to `big_element - (not_mid - 1)`, while the corresponding elements in `cliquess` will all be set to `clique`.
