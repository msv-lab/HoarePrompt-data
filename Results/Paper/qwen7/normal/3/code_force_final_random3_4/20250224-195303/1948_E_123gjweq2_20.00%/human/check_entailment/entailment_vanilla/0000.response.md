Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is supposed to handle the main logic of the problem.
   - It calculates the number of cliques (`cliques`) using `ceil(n / k)`.
   - It initializes two arrays: `arr` and `cliquess`, both of size `n`.

2. **Loop through `cliques`**:
   - The loop runs from `0` to `cliques - 1`.
   - For each iteration, it calls the `make_array` function to fill the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays.

3. **Function `make_array`**:
   - This function takes `left`, `right`, and `clique` as parameters.
   - It calculates `small_element` and `big_element` based on the indices `left` and `right`.
   - It splits the range `[left, right]` into two parts: `mid` and `not_mid`.
   - It fills the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays with values based on the calculated `small_element` and `big_element`.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `cliques`**:
   - The calculation `cliques = ceil(n / k)` is correct, but it doesn't ensure that all vertices are assigned unique integers from `1` to `n`.

2. **Incorrect Array Filling**:
   - The `make_array` function does not correctly ensure that all integers from `1` to `n` are used uniquely.
   - The current implementation might lead to duplicate values or missing values in the `arr` array.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function does not handle cases where `k` is very large compared to `n`, leading to potential issues in the assignment of unique integers.

### Example Test Case Analysis:

Let's consider the example test case `n = 5` and `k = 4`:

- Expected output:
  ```
  3 1 5 2 4
  2
  1 1 2 1 2
  ```

- Actual output from the given code:
  - The `arr` array will be filled with values that do not necessarily cover all integers from `1` to `5` uniquely.
  - The `cliquess` array will be filled with values indicating the cliques, but it might not match the expected partition.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It fails to ensure that all integers from `1` to `n` are used uniquely and does not correctly partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
