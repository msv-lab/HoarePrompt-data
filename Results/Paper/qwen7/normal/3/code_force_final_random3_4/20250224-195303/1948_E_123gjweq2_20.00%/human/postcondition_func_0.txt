The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 40, and `k` is an integer between 1 and 2n. It calculates the number of cliques (`cliques`) based on these parameters and uses the `make_array` function to fill an array `arr` with specific values. After processing, it prints the updated array `arr`, the number of cliques, and an array of zeros (`cliquess`). The final state of the program includes an updated `arr` containing values from `0 * k` to `min((cliques * k - 1), n - 1)`, a `cliques` value indicating the number of cliques, and a `cliquess` array consisting entirely of zeros.
