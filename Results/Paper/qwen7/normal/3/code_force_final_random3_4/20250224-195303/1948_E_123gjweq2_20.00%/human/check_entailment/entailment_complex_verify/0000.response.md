### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step using the annotated code and the problem description.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `cliques = ceil(n / k)`: This calculates the number of cliques needed.
   - `arr = [0] * n`: Initializes an array of size `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - `cliquess = [0] * n`: Initializes another array of size `n` with all elements set to 0.

2. **Filling the Array**:
   - The `for` loop iterates over the number of cliques.
   - `make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)`: This function call fills the array `arr` and `cliquess` for each clique.

3. **Printing the Results**:
   - `print(*arr)`: Prints the array `arr`.
   - `print(cliques)`: Prints the number of cliques.
   - `print(*cliquess)`: Prints the array `cliquess`.

#### Function `make_array` Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `small_element = left + 1`: The smallest element in the current segment.
   - `big_element = right + 1`: The largest element in the current segment.
   - `mid = (big_element - small_element) // 2`: The midpoint of the segment.
   - `not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid`: The remaining elements in the segment.

2. **Filling the Array**:
   - The first `for` loop fills the array `arr` and `cliquess` from `left` to `left + mid - 1` with increasing values starting from `small_element`.
   - The second `for` loop fills the array `arr` and `cliquess` from `left + mid` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1` with decreasing values starting from `big_element`.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
1. **Partitioning Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` divides the vertices into segments of size `k` and assigns them to the same clique. This approach does not necessarily minimize the number of cliques.
   - For example, consider `n = 5` and `k = 4`. The program outputs:
     ```
     1 2 3 4 5
     2
     1 1 1 1 1
     ```
     This is incorrect because placing all vertices in a single clique does not minimize the number of cliques. A correct partition would be:
     ```
     1 2 3 4 5
     1
     1 1 1 1 1
     ```

2. **General Case**:
   - The function `make_array` does not handle the assignment of values to vertices in a way that ensures the minimum number of cliques. It simply divides the vertices into segments and assigns them to the same clique, which may not be optimal.

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques for all potential cases. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect as it does not guarantee the minimum number of cliques for all cases.
