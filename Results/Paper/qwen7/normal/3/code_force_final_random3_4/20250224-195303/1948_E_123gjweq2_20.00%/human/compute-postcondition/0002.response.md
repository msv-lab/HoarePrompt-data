Output State: **`left` is an integer such that `left` < `right`, `right` is an integer, `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right + 1 - (left + 1)) // 2**.

This means that the variable `mid` is calculated as half the difference between `big_element` and `small_element`, which simplifies to `(right + 1 - (left + 1)) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
