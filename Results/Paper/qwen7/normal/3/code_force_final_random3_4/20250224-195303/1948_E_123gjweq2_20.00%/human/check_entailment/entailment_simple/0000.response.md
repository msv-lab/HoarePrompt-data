Reasoning:
1. The problem requires assigning distinct integers to vertices such that the graph formed can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.
2. The provided solution attempts to achieve this by dividing the vertices into segments based on the value of `k` and assigning them distinct values.
3. The `func_1` function calculates the number of cliques needed and initializes arrays `arr` and `cliquess`.
4. The `make_array` function fills the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays according to the specified rules.
5. The logic in `make_array` ensures that the values assigned to vertices within each segment are distinct and follow a pattern that helps in forming cliques when the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` is met.

However, upon closer inspection, the logic in `make_array` does not fully ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques. Specifically, the way values are assigned may not always result in the optimal partitioning, especially for larger values of `n` and `k`.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the provided solution does not guarantee the minimum number of cliques for all cases. Therefore, the solution is not correct for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **False**
