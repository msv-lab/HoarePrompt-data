Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `j` is defined in the range `range(n // 2, 0, -1)`.
   - The loop variable `n` is the length of the list `s`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `j`:**
   - The loop starts with `j` in the range `n // 2` to `0` (exclusive) with a step of `-1`.
   - Therefore, the initial value of `j` should be `n // 2`.

3. **Determine the State of `n`:**
   - The variable `n` is given as the length of the list `s`, and it must be at least 2 for the loop to execute (since `n // 2` must be a positive integer).

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - The initial value of `t` is irrelevant to the loop execution, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - The list `s` and its length `n` need to be adjusted to ensure the loop can start.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `j` should be set to `n // 2`.
- `n` must be at least 2.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is a list of characters from the input string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` must be at least 2, `j` is set to `n // 2`**.
