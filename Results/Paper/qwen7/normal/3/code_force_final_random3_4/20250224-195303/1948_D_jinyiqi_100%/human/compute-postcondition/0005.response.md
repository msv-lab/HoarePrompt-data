Postcondition: **`n` must be at least 2, `j` is set to `n // 2`. The value of `j` is half of `n`. The character at index `k` in string `s` is either a question mark (`?`) or the character at index `k + j` in string `s` is a question mark (`?`), or the character at index `k` in string `s` is equal to the character at index `k + j` in string `s`.**
