Based on the initial state provided, we need to determine the value of `count` before the execution of the print statement. The conditions for incrementing `count` are:

1. `s[k]` equals `'?'` or `s[k + j]` equals `'?'`.
2. `s[k]` equals `s[k + j]`.

From the postcondition, we know:
- `count` remains unchanged.
- `k` is `k_start + 1`.
- `n - j` remains the same.

Since `count` remains unchanged, it means that none of the conditions for incrementing `count` were met during the evaluation. Therefore, `count` must be 0.

Now, we need to print `count * 2`. Given that `count` is 0, the result of `count * 2` is also 0.

Output: **0**
