Based on the initial state provided:

- `count` is 1 if either `s[k]` is '?', `s[k + j]` is '?', or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`. Otherwise, `count` is 0.
- `j` is equal to `count`.
- `n` is greater than `j`.
- `k` is 0.

We need to determine the value of `count` first. Since no specific values for `s[k]`, `s[k + j]`, or their relationship are given, we must consider the general case where none of the conditions for setting `count` to 1 are met. Therefore, `count` is 0.

Given that `count` is 0, `j` is also 0 (since `j` is equal to `count`).

Now, we need to evaluate the expression `count * 2`.

Output: **0**
