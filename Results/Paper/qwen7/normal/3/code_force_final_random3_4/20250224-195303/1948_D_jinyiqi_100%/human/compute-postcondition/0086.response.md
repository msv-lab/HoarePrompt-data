Postcondition: **`count` is an integer, `s` is a string, `k` is `k_prev + 1`, `j` is the same as before, the character at index `k_prev + 1` in `s` is neither a '?', the character at index `(k_prev + 1) + j` in `s` is not a '?', and the characters at indices `k_prev + 1` and `(k_prev + 1) + j` in `s` are not the same. If the character at index `k` in `s` is '?', the character at index `k + j` in `s` is '?', or the characters at indices `k` and `k + j` in `s` are the same, then `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `count` remains 0.**
