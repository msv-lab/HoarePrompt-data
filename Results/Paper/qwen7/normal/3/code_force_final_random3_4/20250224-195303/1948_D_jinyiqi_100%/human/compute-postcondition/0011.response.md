Postcondition: `n` must be at least 2, `j` is set to `n // 2`, and `count` is increased by 1 if the character at index `k` in string `s` is either a question mark (`?`), the character at index `k + j` in string `s` is a question mark (`?`), or the character at index `k` in string `s` is equal to the character at index `k + j` in string `s`. Otherwise, `count` remains 0.
