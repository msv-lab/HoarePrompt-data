Output State: `count` is 0, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than `j`, `k` is 2, and the loop has completed all its iterations.

Explanation: Based on the given information, the loop continues to increment `k` from 0 up to `n - j - 1`. The value of `count` resets to 0 each time through the loop unless specific conditions are met (which did not happen in the first three iterations). Since `count` was not incremented to match `j` within these iterations, it remains 0 after all iterations. The variable `j` and `n` do not change inside the loop, so they retain their initial values. The variable `k` increments by 1 with each iteration, so after the loop completes, `k` will be equal to `n - j - 1`, which is 2 in this case.
