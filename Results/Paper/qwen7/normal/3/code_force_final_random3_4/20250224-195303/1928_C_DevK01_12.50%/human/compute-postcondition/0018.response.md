Postcondition: `i` is 1, `w` is an integer such that `w` is the integer part of the square root of `q` and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `q` is divisible by `i`, and either `M` is a list containing the elements 1 and `q // i` with `q // i` greater than or equal to `x - 1`, or no changes are made to `M` since there is no else part.
