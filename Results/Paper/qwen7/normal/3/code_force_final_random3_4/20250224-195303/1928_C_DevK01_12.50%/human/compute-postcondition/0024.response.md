Output State: **`i` is 2, `w` is the integer part of the square root of `q` and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `q` is divisible by `i`, `M` is a list containing the elements 1, `q // i`, and `i` with `q // i` greater than or equal to `x - 1`, and `M` is extended by appending `q // i` to itself.**

Explanation: The code `M += [q // i]` appends the value of `q // i` to the list `M`. Given the initial conditions, `M` initially contains the elements 1, `q // i`, and `i` with `q // i` greater than or equal to `x - 1`. After executing the code, `M` is extended by appending `q // i` to itself, making the updated list contain 1, `q // i`, `i`, and `q // i` again.
