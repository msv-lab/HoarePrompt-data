You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: q is an integer representing the position in the line (1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9), and x is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 ≤ x < q).
def func_1(q, x):
    M = []
    w = math.sqrt(q)
    if (w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1) :
        M += [w]
    #State: Postcondition: `q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9), and `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 ≤ x < q); `M` is a list containing the value of `w`, where `w` is the square root of `q` and is an integer, and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
    for i in range(1, int(w // 1)):
        if q % i == 0:
            if i >= x - 1:

    #State: The loop will continue to execute until `i` reaches `w`, which is the integer part of the square root of `q`. For each `i` from 1 to `w`, if `q` is divisible by `i` and `i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, or if `q // i` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, the value of `q // i` will be added to the list `M`. Therefore, `M` will contain all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
    return M
    #The program returns a list M containing all divisors of q that are greater than or equal to x - 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `q` and `x`. `q` represents the position in the line, and `x` represents the number Vasya received during the settling. The function calculates and returns a list `M` containing all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n` and `x`.

2. **Calculating `y`:**
   - `y = n + x` is calculated.
   - If `y` is odd, the program prints `0` and continues to the next test case.
   - Otherwise, it proceeds to call `func_1`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` takes two parameters `q` and `x`.
   - It initializes an empty list `M` to store valid `k` values.
   - It calculates the square root of `q` and checks if it is an integer greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If true, it adds this value to `M`.
   - It then iterates from `1` to `int(w // 1)` and checks if `q` is divisible by `i` and if both `i` and `q // i` are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If true, it adds these values to `M`.

4. **Returning Valid `k` Values:**
   - `func_1` returns a list `M` which contains all valid `k` values.
   - The main loop converts this list to a set to remove duplicates and then calculates the length of the set, which gives the number of valid `k` values.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Condition Check for Odd `y`:**
   - The condition `if y % 2 != 0:` correctly identifies when `y` is odd, and since `y` should always be even for a valid `k`, this check is correct.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The logic in `func_1` seems to be checking for valid `k` values based on the constraints. However, let's verify the logic:
     - The first condition `if w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1:` checks if `w` is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`. This is a valid check.
     - The loop `for i in range(1, int(w // 1)):` iterates through potential divisors of `q` and checks if they and their corresponding quotients are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. This is also a valid approach.

3. **Handling Duplicates:**
   - Converting the list `M` to a set removes any duplicate values, ensuring that each `k` is counted only once.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The length of the set `L1` is printed, which gives the number of valid `k` values.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the number of valid `k` values based on the given constraints. There are no apparent errors in the logic or implementation.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
