Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head involves the variable `i`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `1` to `int(w // 1)`.
   - This means `i` will take values from `1` up to the integer part of `w`.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `i`:**
   - At the start of the loop, `i` should be set to `1` because the loop starts from `1`.

4. **Determine the State of `w`:**
   - `w` is defined as the integer part of the square root of `q`.
   - Since the loop runs until `i` reaches `int(w // 1)`, `w` must be an integer such that `int(w // 1)` is a valid starting point for the loop.

5. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, `w` must be at least `1` (since the loop starts from `1`).

6. **Consider the Constraints:**
   - `q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9).
   - `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 ≤ x < q).
   - `M` is a list containing the value of `w`, where `w` is the square root of `q` and is an integer, and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `i` starts at `1` and that `w` is an integer that allows the loop to execute.

**Final State:**
- `i` is `1`.
- `w` is an integer such that `w` is the integer part of the square root of `q` and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

Thus, the final state is:
State: **`i` is 1, `w` is an integer that is the integer part of the square root of `q` and is greater than or equal to `x - 1`**
