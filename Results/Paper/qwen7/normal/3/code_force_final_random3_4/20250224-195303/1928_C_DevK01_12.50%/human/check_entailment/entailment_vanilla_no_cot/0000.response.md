Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `y`**: The variable `y` is calculated as `n + x`, but according to the problem, it should be `n + x - 1`. This is because the position `x` is adjusted within the sequence, and the formula needs to account for this correctly.

2. **Incorrect Handling of `func_1` Function**: The function `func_1` is used to find possible values of `k`, but its logic is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1:` is unnecessary and incorrect. The function should directly check if the divisors of `q` are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

3. **Set Conversion**: The use of `set` to remove duplicates is unnecessary and can be simplified.

4. **Edge Cases**: The solution does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `x` is very close to `n`.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    y = n + x - 1
    if y % 2 != 0:
        print(0)
        continue
    else:
        q = (y - 2) // 2
        w = math.isqrt(q)
        M = []
        for i in range(1, w + 1):
            if q % i == 0:
                if i >= x - 1:
                    M.append(i)
                if q // i >= x - 1:
                    M.append(q // i)
        M = list(set(M))
        if n >= 3 * x - 2:
            q = (n - x) // 2
            w = math.isqrt(q)
            for i in range(1, w + 1):
                if q % i == 0:
                    if i >= x - 1:
                        M.append(i)
                    if q // i >= x - 1:
                        M.append(q // i)
        M = list(set(M))
        print(len(M))
```

This corrected version addresses the issues mentioned and should work correctly for the given problem.
