Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the number of valid `k` values for a given `n` and `x`. Specifically, the program uses a function `func_1` which seems to be intended to find divisors of a certain value, but the logic within `func_1` and its usage in the main part of the program do not align with the problem description.

To illustrate, let's consider the following test case:

- Input: `100 99`
- Expected Output: `0`

According to the problem description, the settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions. For `n = 100` and `x = 99`, we need to check if there exists a `k` such that the settling pattern fits. However, the program does not correctly handle this scenario. The program incorrectly calculates the number of valid `k` values and does not properly account for the repeating pattern.

Hereâ€™s a more detailed breakdown:
- The program calculates `y = n + x` and checks if `y` is even. If `y` is odd, it prints `0`, which is correct.
- However, the subsequent logic in `func_1` and its application to the problem does not correctly determine the number of valid `k` values.

Since the program does not correctly handle the logic for determining the number of valid `k` values, it fails for at least one input case, making the program incorrect.
