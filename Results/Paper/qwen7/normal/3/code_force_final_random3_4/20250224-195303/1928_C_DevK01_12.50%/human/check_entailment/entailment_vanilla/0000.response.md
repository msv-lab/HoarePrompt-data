Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n` and `x`.

2. **Calculating `y`:**
   - `y = n + x` is calculated.
   - If `y` is odd, the program prints `0` and continues to the next test case.
   - Otherwise, it proceeds to call `func_1`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` takes two parameters `q` and `x`.
   - It initializes an empty list `M` to store valid `k` values.
   - It calculates the square root of `q` and checks if it is an integer greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If true, it adds this value to `M`.
   - It then iterates from `1` to `int(w // 1)` and checks if `q` is divisible by `i` and if both `i` and `q // i` are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If true, it adds these values to `M`.

4. **Returning Valid `k` Values:**
   - `func_1` returns a list `M` which contains all valid `k` values.
   - The main loop converts this list to a set to remove duplicates and then calculates the length of the set, which gives the number of valid `k` values.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Condition Check for Odd `y`:**
   - The condition `if y % 2 != 0:` correctly identifies when `y` is odd, and since `y` should always be even for a valid `k`, this check is correct.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The logic in `func_1` seems to be checking for valid `k` values based on the constraints. However, let's verify the logic:
     - The first condition `if w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1:` checks if `w` is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`. This is a valid check.
     - The loop `for i in range(1, int(w // 1)):` iterates through potential divisors of `q` and checks if they and their corresponding quotients are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. This is also a valid approach.

3. **Handling Duplicates:**
   - Converting the list `M` to a set removes any duplicate values, ensuring that each `k` is counted only once.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The length of the set `L1` is printed, which gives the number of valid `k` values.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the number of valid `k` values based on the given constraints. There are no apparent errors in the logic or implementation.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
