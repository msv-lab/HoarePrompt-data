### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `kreker` using `int(input())`.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a for loop.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads two integers `n` and `m` using `map(int, input().split())`.

3. **Logic Check**:
   - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative.
     - If `n - m` is even, it means the number of moves to add or remove cubes can be balanced.
     - If `n - m` is non-negative, it means the final number of cubes `m` can be achieved by performing `n` moves.
   - If the condition is true, it prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program outputs "Yes" or "No" in the required format.

However, there is a subtle issue with the logic check. Specifically, the condition `n - m >= 0` ensures that the final number of cubes `m` can be achieved, but it does not guarantee that the number of moves `n` is sufficient to achieve `m` cubes. The correct condition should be `abs(n - m)` to ensure that the absolute difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative, which would mean that `n` moves are enough to achieve `m` cubes.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input: `3 4`
- Here, `n = 3` and `m = 4`. The difference `n - m = -1`, which is not non-negative. However, the absolute difference `abs(n - m) = 1` is odd, meaning it cannot be achieved with exactly 3 moves.

The current logic fails to account for the possibility that `n` might be insufficient to achieve `m` cubes if `n - m` is negative.

### Corrected Logic:
The correct condition should be:
```python
if abs(n - m) % 2 == 0:
```

### Corrected Annotated Code:
```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if abs(n - m) % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was inaccurate because the condition `n - m >= 0` is not sufficient to ensure that the number of moves `n` is enough to achieve `m` cubes. The corrected condition should use `abs(n - m) % 2 == 0`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
