Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where `n` is less than `m`. According to the problem description, Nikita can only add or remove exactly one cube per move. Therefore, the number of cubes in the tower after `n` moves can only be within the range `[0, n]`. However, the current implementation checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0`, which does not account for the fact that `m` cannot be greater than `n`.

For example, consider the test case `n = 2` and `m = 4`. The program will incorrectly output "Yes" because `(2 - 4) % 2 == 0` and `2 - 4 >= 0` are both false, but the logic does not properly reflect the constraint that `m` must be within the range `[0, n]`.

A corrected version of the program would check if `0 <= m <= n`:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if 0 <= m <= n:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This corrected version ensures that the program only outputs "Yes" if `m` is within the valid range, thus meeting the problem description for all potential cases.
