Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- The current value of `n - m` is even and greater than or equal to 0.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print('Yes')
```

This statement does not depend on the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, or any other variables; it only prints the string `'Yes'`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **Yes**
