Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- The condition \((n - m) \% 2 \neq 0\) or \(n - m < 0\) is true.

The print statement is `print('No')`.

Given that the print statement directly outputs the string 'No', and no other variables or objects are being evaluated or printed within this statement, the output will be:

Output: **No**
