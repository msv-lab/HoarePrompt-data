Based on the initial state provided, `n` must be at least 4. However, the code snippet does not define or use the variable `j`. Since `j` is not defined, it cannot be determined what value `j` holds. Therefore, we cannot provide a precise value for `j`.

Given this, the output will consist of two identical strings of `j` concatenated together with a space in between.

Output: **j j**
