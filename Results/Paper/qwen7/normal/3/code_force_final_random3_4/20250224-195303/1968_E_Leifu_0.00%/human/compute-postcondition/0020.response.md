Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < t`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive).

3. **Adjust the states based on the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `t`.
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and increases by 1 each iteration, the loop will execute again if `i` is still less than `t`.

Given that `i` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration, the loop will execute again as long as `t` is greater than 0. However, since `t` is an input integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), it will always be greater than 0.

4. **Update the states**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1.
   - `t` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive).
- `i` is 1.

Since `n` and `j` are not part of the loop head, their values remain unchanged.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 1**
