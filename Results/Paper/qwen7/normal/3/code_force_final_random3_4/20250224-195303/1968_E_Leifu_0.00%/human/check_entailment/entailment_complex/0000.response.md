Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid.
2. The provided program attempts to generate a specific pattern of cell coordinates for each test case.
3. Let's analyze the program for correctness:

   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it prints the coordinates \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\).
   - For \(n = 3\), it prints \((2, 3)\) as well.
   - For \(n > 3\), it prints \((2, 4)\) and then pairs of integers from \(4\) to \(n\) paired with themselves.

4. Now, let's check if this approach maximizes the size of \(\mathcal{H}\):

   - For \(n = 2\):
     - Coordinates: \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\)
     - Distances: \(\{0, 1\}\)
     - Size of \(\mathcal{H}\): 2 (correct)

   - For \(n = 3\):
     - Coordinates: \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((2, 3)\)
     - Distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\)
     - Size of \(\mathcal{H}\): 4 (correct)

   - For \(n = 4\):
     - Coordinates: \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), and \((4, 4)\)
     - Distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\)
     - Size of \(\mathcal{H}\): 5 (correct)

   - For \(n = 5\):
     - Coordinates: \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 5)\), \((4, 4)\), and \((5, 5)\)
     - Distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}\)
     - Size of \(\mathcal{H}\): 9 (correct)

   - For \(n = 6\):
     - Coordinates: \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 6)\), \((4, 4)\), \((5, 5)\), and \((6, 6)\)
     - Distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\}\)
     - Size of \(\mathcal{H}\): 13 (correct)

Given that the program generates the correct coordinates for various values of \(n\) and the resulting set \(\mathcal{H}\) matches the expected maximum size, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
