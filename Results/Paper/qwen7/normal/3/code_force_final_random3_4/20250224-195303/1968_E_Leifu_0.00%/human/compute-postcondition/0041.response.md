Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `t` is an input integer between 1 and 50 (though this variable is not involved in the loop).
   - `i` is 2 (though this variable is not involved in the loop).
   - `n` is an input integer, and its value is assigned from `int(input())`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range from 4 to `n + 1`.

4. **Determine the necessary conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 4 because the loop starts from 4 and goes up to `n + 1`.
   - The variable `j` will take values starting from 4 up to `n + 1`, but the exact value of `j` is not relevant for adjusting the initial state.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`n` must be at least 4**
