Reasoning:
1. Let's analyze the program step by step.
2. The function `func()` takes an input `t`, which is the number of test cases.
3. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` which represents the size of the grid.
4. The program always prints the coordinates `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`.
5. If `n` is 3, it additionally prints `(2, 3)`.
6. For `n > 3`, it prints `(2, 4)` and then a series of coordinates from `(4, 4)` to `(n, n)`.

Now, let's check if this approach maximizes the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\):

- For \(n = 2\):
  - The program prints `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`.
  - The Manhattan distances are \(\{0, 1\}\).
  - This is correct since the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 2.

- For \(n = 3\):
  - The program prints `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, and `(2, 3)`.
  - The Manhattan distances are \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\).
  - This is correct since the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 3.

- For \(n > 3\):
  - The program prints `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, and then pairs \((j, j)\) for \(j\) from 4 to \(n\).
  - This configuration ensures that the distances include:
    - Distances involving `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`: \(\{0, 1\}\).
    - Distances involving `(2, 4)` and other points: \(\{2, 3, 4, \ldots, n-1\}\).
    - Distances involving points \((j, j)\): \(\{0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1\}\).

This configuration covers all possible distances from 0 to \(n-1\), ensuring the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(n\).

Given that the program correctly handles the specific cases and generalizes to maximize \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \(n\), the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
