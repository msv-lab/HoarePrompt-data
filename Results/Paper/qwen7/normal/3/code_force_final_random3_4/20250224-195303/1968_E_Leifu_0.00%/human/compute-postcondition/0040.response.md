The initial state provides that `t` is an input integer between 1 and 50, `i` is 2, and `n` is an input integer that is assigned the value of `int(input())`. However, the `print` statement does not reference any of these variables. It simply prints the string `'2 4'`.

Therefore, regardless of the values of `t`, `i`, and `n`, the output will be the string `'2 4'`.

Output: **2 4**
