Output State: **`t` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `A` is equal to `int(m // a) + 1`, `B` is equal to `int(m / b) + 1`**

Explanation: The code `a, b, m = map(int, input().split())` takes three integers as input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, and `m` respectively. The values of `t`, `A`, and `B` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `a`, `b`, and `m` as input integers, while `t`, `A`, and `B` retain their original expressions.
