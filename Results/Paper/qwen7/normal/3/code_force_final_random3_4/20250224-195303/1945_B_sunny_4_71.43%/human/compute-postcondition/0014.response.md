Output State: **`t` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `A` is equal to `int(m / a) + 1`, `a` is updated to a new input integer, `b` is updated to a new input integer, `m` is updated to a new input integer, `B` is equal to `int(m / b) + 1`.**

Explanation: The code updates the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` to new input integers. It then calculates `B` as `int(m / b) + 1`. The previous values of `t`, `A`, `a`, `b`, and `m` are updated accordingly, and the new value of `B` is calculated based on the new values of `m` and `b`.
