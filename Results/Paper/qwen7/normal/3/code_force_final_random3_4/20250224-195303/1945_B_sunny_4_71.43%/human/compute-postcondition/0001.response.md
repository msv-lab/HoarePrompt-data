Let's break down the task step by step:

1. Identify the objects in the loop head:
   - The loop uses `_` as the iterator variable, which is typically used when the value of the iterator is not needed within the loop body.
   - The loop also uses `t` as the range parameter.

2. Determine which states need to be adjusted:
   - The loop will execute based on the value of `t`.
   - Since `_` is not used, its initial value does not matter.
   - The key factor for the loop to execute is the value of `t`.

3. Adjust the state accordingly:
   - The state before the loop starts is given as `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1 (since `range(t)` will not include 0).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute, which means `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
