The function processes up to 10,000 test cases, where for each test case, it reads three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(m\). It calculates two values, \(A\) and \(B\), where \(A\) is \(\left\lceil \frac{m}{a} \right\rceil + 1\) and \(B\) is \(\left\lceil \frac{m}{b} \right\rceil + 1\). For each test case, it prints the sum of \(A\) and \(B\). After processing all test cases, the function outputs nothing further, leaving the input variables in their final states from the last test case.
