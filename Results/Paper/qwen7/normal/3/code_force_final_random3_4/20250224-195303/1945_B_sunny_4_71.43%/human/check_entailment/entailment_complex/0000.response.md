Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time. However, the logic used to calculate \(A\) and \(B\) is incorrect. Specifically, \(A\) and \(B\) should represent the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period of \(m+1\) minutes, not just \(m\) minutes.

- \(A\) should be calculated as the number of intervals of length \(a\) that fit into \(m+1\), which is \(\left\lfloor \frac{m+1}{a} \right\rfloor\).
- Similarly, \(B\) should be calculated as \(\left\lfloor \frac{m+1}{b} \right\rfloor\).

The current implementation uses \(m\) instead of \(m+1\) and adds 1 directly, which does not correctly account for the visibility duration.

Given the provided code, the calculation for \(A\) and \(B\) should be adjusted to reflect the correct visibility period. The corrected code would look like this:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        A = (m + 1) // a
        
        B = (m + 1) // b
        
        print(A + B)
```

With this correction, the program will correctly compute the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.

Correctness: **False**
