Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The logic in the program incorrectly assumes that the number of fireworks visible from each installation can be determined by dividing the visibility time \(m\) by the launch interval and adding 1. This approach does not account for the simultaneous visibility of fireworks from both installations.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of \(a\) and \(b\) to determine the periodicity at which fireworks from both installations coincide. Then, calculate how many fireworks from each installation can be visible during this period and adjust for any overlaps.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // math.gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = lcm(a, b)
        # Calculate the number of fireworks from each installation within the LCM period
        A = (lcm_ab // a) + 1
        B = (lcm_ab // b) + 1
        # Subtract 1 because the firework launched at the start of the LCM period is counted twice
        max_visible = A + B - 1
        print(max_visible)

func()
```

This corrected program uses the least common multiple (LCM) to determine the periodicity at which fireworks from both installations coincide and then calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.
