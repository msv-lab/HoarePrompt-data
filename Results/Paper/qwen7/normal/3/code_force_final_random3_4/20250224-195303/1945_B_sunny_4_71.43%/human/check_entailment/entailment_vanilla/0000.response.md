### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.
   - Fireworks from the first installation are launched every `a` minutes.
   - Fireworks from the second installation are launched every `b` minutes.
   - Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes after launch.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution calculates `A` and `B` as follows:
     - \( A = \left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor + 1 \)
     - \( B = \left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor + 1 \)
   - It then prints `A + B`.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The calculation of `A` and `B` represents the number of fireworks launched by the first and second installations within the visibility period `m`.
   - However, this approach does not account for the overlap of fireworks from different installations. Specifically, it assumes that all fireworks launched within `m` minutes are visible simultaneously, which is incorrect.

4. **Example Verification:**
   - Consider the example where `a = 6`, `b = 7`, and `m = 4`:
     - \( A = \left\lfloor \frac{4}{6} \right\rfloor + 1 = 1 \)
     - \( B = \left\lfloor \frac{4}{7} \right\rfloor + 1 = 1 \)
     - The solution would print `1 + 1 = 2`, but the correct answer should be `2` as explained in the problem statement.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to find the intervals where fireworks from both installations overlap.
   - The maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously would be the sum of the number of fireworks from each installation minus the overlaps.

### Conclusion:

The given solution is incorrect because it does not account for the overlapping fireworks from different installations. Therefore, the provided program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
