Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is 0 (though `t` is not used in the code, so it doesn't affect the output).
   - `a` is an input integer.
   - `b` is an input integer.
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - `A` is calculated as `int(m / a) + 1`.
   - `a` is then updated to a new input integer.
   - `b` is updated to a new input integer.
   - `m` is updated to a new input integer.
   - `B` is calculated as `int(m / b) + 1`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(A + B)
   ```

Given the above, we need to determine the values of `A` and `B` after the updates to `a`, `b`, and `m`.

- Initially, `A = int(m / a) + 1`.
- After updating `a`, `b`, and `m`, `A` becomes `int(new_m / new_a) + 1`.
- Similarly, `B` becomes `int(new_m / new_b) + 1`.

Therefore, the expression `A + B` will be:
\[ \text{A} + \text{B} = \left(\text{int(new\_m / new\_a)} + 1\right) + \left(\text{int(new\_m / new\_b)} + 1\right) \]

Simplifying this, we get:
\[ \text{A} + \text{B} = \text{int(new\_m / new\_a)} + \text{int(new\_m / new\_b)} + 2 \]

So, the output of the print statement will be the sum of the integer division results plus 2.

Output: **int(new_m / new_a) + int(new_m / new_b) + 2**
