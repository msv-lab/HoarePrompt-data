Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then enters a loop to process each test case.

2. **Variables Initialization**:
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` using `map(int, input().split())`.

3. **Calculations**:
   - `A` is calculated as `int(m / a) + 1`. This represents the number of times the first installation launches fireworks within the visibility period of `m` minutes.
   - `B` is calculated as `int(m / b) + 1`. This represents the number of times the second installation launches fireworks within the visibility period of `m` minutes.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the sum of `A` and `B`, which is intended to represent the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously.

### Reasoning

The logic behind the calculations is flawed. Specifically, the variables `A` and `B` do not correctly account for the simultaneous visibility of fireworks from both installations. 

- The formula `int(m / a) + 1` calculates the number of intervals of `a` within `m` minutes, but it does not consider the exact timing of when fireworks are launched and their overlap.
- Similarly, `int(m / b) + 1` does the same for `b`.

To find the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to understand how often both installations launch fireworks at the same time. However, the current approach does not capture this correctly.

### Example Analysis

Let's take the example provided in the problem statement:

- For the input `6 7 4`:
  - `A = int(4 / 6) + 1 = 1`
  - `B = int(4 / 7) + 1 = 1`
  - The program outputs `A + B = 2`

This is incorrect because, as explained in the problem statement, the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously is 2, but the program incorrectly calculates it as 2.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
