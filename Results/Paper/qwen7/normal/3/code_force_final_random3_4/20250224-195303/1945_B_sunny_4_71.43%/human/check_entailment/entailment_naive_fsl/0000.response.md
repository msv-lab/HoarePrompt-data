Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen simultaneously. The logic in the program calculates `A` and `B` as the number of fireworks launched within `m` minutes from the first and second installations, respectively. However, this approach does not account for the overlapping visibility period of fireworks launched at different intervals.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:
- Input: `a = 3`, `b = 4`, `m = 10`

According to the problem description:
- Fireworks from the first installation will be launched at times: `0, 3, 6, 9`.
- Fireworks from the second installation will be launched at times: `0, 4, 8`.

The program would calculate:
- `A = int(10 / 3) + 1 = 4`
- `B = int(10 / 4) + 1 = 3`

Thus, the program outputs `A + B = 7`. However, the actual maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 4, which occurs at `t = 0` and `t = 4` (both from the first and second installations).

Therefore, the program does not handle the overlapping visibility period correctly, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
