Output State: **The loop has completed all its iterations, and the function has returned 2.**

Explanation: Based on the given information, the loop continues to iterate until either `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0. After the third iteration, `t` is 2, which meets the condition for returning `i`. Since `i` is incremented with each iteration, after the loop completes, `i` would be 2. The function then returns `i`, which is 2 in this case.
