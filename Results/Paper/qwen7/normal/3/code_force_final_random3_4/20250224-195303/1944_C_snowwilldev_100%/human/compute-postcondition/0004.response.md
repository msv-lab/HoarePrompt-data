Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, N must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `cnt` is a defaultdict with all values initialized to 0; `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the variable `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer within the range 1 to 2⋅10^4, `N` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code, `a` remains a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, and `cnt` remains a defaultdict with all values initialized to 0. However, the value of `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1, where `i` is an index within the bounds of the list `a`.
