Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, `N` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `N = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `N`. The variable `t` remains unchanged from its initial state. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), and `N` is set to the integer input provided by the user.
