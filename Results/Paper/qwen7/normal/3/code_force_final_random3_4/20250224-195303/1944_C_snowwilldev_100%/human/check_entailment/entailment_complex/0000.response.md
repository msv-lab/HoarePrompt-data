Reasoning:
The provided function `func_1()` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Objective of the Game**: The goal is to determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in `c`.

2. **Alice's and Bob's Moves**:
   - Alice can pick any element from `a` and append it to `c` and remove it from `a`.
   - Bob can only pick an element from `a` and remove it without appending it to `c`.

3. **Function Logic**:
   - The function counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` using a `defaultdict`.
   - It then iterates through the possible values (0 to N) and checks the count of each value.
   - If a value occurs exactly once, it increments a counter `t`.
   - If `t` reaches 2 or if a value does not occur at all, the function returns that value.

4. **Issues**:
   - The function does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. It simply counts occurrences and returns a value based on those counts, which does not reflect the strategic nature of the game.
   - The function does not account for the fact that Alice can strategically choose elements to maximize the MEX, and Bob can minimize it.
   - The function does not consider the optimal strategy for both players, which would involve Alice choosing elements to ensure a high MEX and Bob removing elements to prevent this.

Given these issues, the function does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
