Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, `N` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `a`. The variables `t` and `N` remain unchanged from their initial state.
