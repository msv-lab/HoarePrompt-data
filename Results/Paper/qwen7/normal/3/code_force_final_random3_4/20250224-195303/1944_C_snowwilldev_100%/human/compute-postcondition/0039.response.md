Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes an array of integers based on the given constraints. It returns 0, 1, or 2 based on specific conditions within the array.**

This means the function `func_1` does not take any direct parameters but instead relies on an external array of integers defined elsewhere. Based on the conditions specified in the problem statement, the function returns either 0, 1, or 2.
