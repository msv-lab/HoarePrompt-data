Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, `N` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `cnt` is a defaultdict with all values initialized to 0**.

Explanation: The code initializes a `defaultdict` named `cnt` with all values set to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `N`, or `a`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The `cnt` dictionary is now ready to be used for counting occurrences of elements.
