Output State: **`t` is 0, `N` is the number of elements in the list `a`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `cnt` is a `defaultdict` where each key is an integer from the list `a` and its corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `t` to 0. The loop and the operations involving `cnt` and `a` are not included in the given snippet, so the values of `N`, `a`, and `cnt` remain as described in the initial state.
