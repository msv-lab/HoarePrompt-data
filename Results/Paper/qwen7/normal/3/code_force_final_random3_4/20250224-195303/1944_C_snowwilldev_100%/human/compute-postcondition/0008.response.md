Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), `N` must be greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `cnt` is a `defaultdict` with all values initialized to 0, `i` is `i + 2`, `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code increments the count of the element `a[i]` in the dictionary `cnt`. The variable `i` is updated to `i + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `t`, `N`, `a`, `cnt`, and the updated value of `i` are as described.
