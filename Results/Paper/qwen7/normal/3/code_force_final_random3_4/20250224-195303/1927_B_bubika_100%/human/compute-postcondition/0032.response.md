Output State: **`r` is the new value of `a[x]` added to its previous value, `i` is the next character in the string `s`, `x` is the index of `i` in the string `b`, and `b[x]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `r += a[x]` increments `r` by the value of `a[x]`. The values of `i`, `x`, and `b[x]` remain unchanged from their initial state. The updated value of `r` is the sum of its previous value and `a[x]`.
