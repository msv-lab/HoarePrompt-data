Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in s:`. The objects involved here are `i` and `s`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i`: This is the loop variable that will take on each character in the string `s`.
   - `s`: This is the string over which the loop will iterate.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as there are characters in the string `s`.

4. **Adjust the given states**:
   - `t` is 1: This value is not relevant to the loop execution and does not need adjustment.
   - `b` is a list of 26 zeros: This list is not used in the loop and does not need adjustment.
   - `r` is an empty string: This string is not used in the loop and does not need adjustment.
   - `s`: For the loop to execute, `s` must be a non-empty string (i.e., it must contain at least one character).

5. **Determine the initial values for the loop variables**:
   - `i`: Before the loop starts, `i` should be set to the first character of the string `s`.
   - `s`: Before the loop starts, `s` must be a non-empty string.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `s`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is the first character of the string `s`, `s` is a non-empty string**
