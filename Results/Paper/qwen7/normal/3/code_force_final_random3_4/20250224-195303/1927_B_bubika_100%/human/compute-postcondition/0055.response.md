Output State: **`r` is now `r + a[x]`, `s` must contain at least one element, `b[x]` is increased by 1, `x` is the index of `i` in list `b`.**

Explanation: The code `x = b.index(i)` finds the index of the element `i` in the list `b` and assigns it to the variable `x`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
