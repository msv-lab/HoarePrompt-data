Output State: **`r` is `r + a[x] + 1 + a[x]`, `x` is the index of `i` in `b`, `b[x]` is `b[x] + 2`, `i` is the next element in `s`.**

Explanation: The code `b[x] += 1` increments the value of `b[x]` by 1. Since `b[x]` was initially `b[x] + 1`, after executing the code, its new value becomes `b[x] + 2`. The other variables (`r`, `x`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
