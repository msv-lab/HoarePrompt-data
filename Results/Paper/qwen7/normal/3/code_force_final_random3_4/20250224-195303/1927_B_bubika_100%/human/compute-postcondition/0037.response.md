Output State: **`r` is the new value of `a[x]` added to its previous value plus `a[x]`, `i` is the next character in the string `s`, `x` is the index of `i` in the string `b`, and `b[x]` is incremented by 1, and `x` is now updated to the index of `i` in the string `b`.**

Explanation: The code `b[x] += 1` increments the value of `b[x]` by 1. After this operation, `x` is automatically updated to the index of `i` in the string `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
