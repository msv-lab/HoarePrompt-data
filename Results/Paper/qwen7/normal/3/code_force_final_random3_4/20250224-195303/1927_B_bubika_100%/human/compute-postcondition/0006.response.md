Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in s:`. This means the loop variable `i` is taken from the list `s`.

2. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: For the loop to execute, the list `s` must contain at least one element. The other variables (`t`, `b`, `n`, and `r`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted.

3. **State the required conditions**: Since the loop iterates over each element in the list `s`, the list `s` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: `s` is a list of integers that must have at least one element.**
