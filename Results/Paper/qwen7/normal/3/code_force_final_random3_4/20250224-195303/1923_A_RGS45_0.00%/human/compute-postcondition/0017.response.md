Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 998 inclusive, `n` is the input integer from the user, `arr` is the new string input from the user, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the new `arr`, or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr`, `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending just before the index `n - y`, `arr` is updated to a new string input from the user.**

Explanation: The code `arr = str(input(''))` takes a new string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `arr`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `z`) remain unchanged with their previous values.
