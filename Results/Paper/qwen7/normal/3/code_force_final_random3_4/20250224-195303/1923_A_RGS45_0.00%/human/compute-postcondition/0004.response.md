Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a string input from the user, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `arr`, or -1 if '1' is not found in `arr`.**

The code assigns the index of the first occurrence of the character '1' in the string `arr` to the variable `x`. If '1' is not found in `arr`, `x` will be assigned -1. The values of `t`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial states.
