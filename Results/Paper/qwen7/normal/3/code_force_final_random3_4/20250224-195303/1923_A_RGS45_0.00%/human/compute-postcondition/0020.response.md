Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 998 inclusive, `n` is the input integer from the user, `arr` is the new string input from the user, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in the new `arr`, or -1 if '1' is not found, `y` is the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr`, `z` is a substring of `arr` starting from index `x` and ending just before the index `n - y`, `y` is updated to the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `z` to be a substring of `arr` from index `x` to `n - y - 1`. It also updates `y` to be the index of the last occurrence of '1' in the reversed `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged.
