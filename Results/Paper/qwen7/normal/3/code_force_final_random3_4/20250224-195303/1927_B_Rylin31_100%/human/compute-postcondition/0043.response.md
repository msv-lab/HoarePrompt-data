Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in array:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `array`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `array` contains at least one element.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `array` must contain at least one element.
   - `s[j]` is incremented by 1.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `s[j]` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, it does not affect the condition for the loop to continue. Therefore, we do not need to change the value of `s[j]`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `array` must still contain at least one element. However, since we are not given specific information about the number of elements left in `array`, we can only ensure that `array` still contains at least one element.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `array` must still contain at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`array` must contain at least one element**
