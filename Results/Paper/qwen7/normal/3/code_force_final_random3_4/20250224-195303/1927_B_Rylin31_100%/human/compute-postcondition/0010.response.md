Output State: **`ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the character whose ASCII value is `s[j + 1] + 97`; `j` is `j + 1`; `s[j]` is `s[j] + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `s[j] += 1` increments the value of `s[j]` by 1. The other variables (`ans` and `j`) are not directly affected by this line of code, so their states remain as described in the initial state.
