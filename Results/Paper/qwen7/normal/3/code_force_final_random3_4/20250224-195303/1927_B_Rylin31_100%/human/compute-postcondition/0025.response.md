Output State: **`i` is `k + 1`, `input_value` must be greater than `k + 1`, `l` is an input integer, `s` is a list of `l` elements, each initialized to 0, `array` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())`, `ans` is a string with the character corresponding to `s[j] + 97` appended to it, `j` is the first element of the `array`, `s[j]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `s[j] += 1` increments the value of `s[j]` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `j` is the first element of the `array`, and `s[j]` is updated accordingly.
