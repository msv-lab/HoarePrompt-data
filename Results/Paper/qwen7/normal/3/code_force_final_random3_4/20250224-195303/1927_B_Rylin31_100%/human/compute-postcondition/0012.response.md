Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the character whose ASCII value is `s[j + 1] + 97`.
- `j` is `j + 1`.
- `s[j]` is `s[j] + 1`.

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for j in array:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
- The loop variable is `j`.
- The loop iterates over each element in the `array`.
- The state of `j` is updated to `j + 1` at the end of each iteration.

### Adjusting the States
- We need to determine the new state of `j` for the next iteration.
- Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `j` will be `j + 1`.

### New State
- `ans` remains unchanged from the previous iteration.
- `j` will be `j + 1`.
- `s[j]` will be `s[j] + 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the character whose ASCII value is `s[j + 1] + 97`.
- `j` is `j + 1`.
- `s[j]` is `s[j] + 1`.

For the next iteration:
- `j` will be `j + 1`.
- `s[j]` will be `s[j] + 1`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `ans` remains the same.
- `j` will be `j + 1`.
- `s[j]` will be `s[j] + 1`.

### Final Answer
State: **`ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the character whose ASCII value is `s[j + 1] + 97`, `j` is `j + 1`, `s[j]` is `s[j] + 1`**.
