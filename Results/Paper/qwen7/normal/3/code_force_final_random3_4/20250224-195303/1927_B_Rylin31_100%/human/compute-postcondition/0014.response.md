Output State: **`ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the character whose ASCII value is `s[j+1] + 97`, `j` is `j + 1`, `s[j]` is `s[j] + 1`.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `s[j]` by 1. The other conditions remain unchanged, so `ans` is still updated by adding the character whose ASCII value is `s[j+1] + 97`, `j` is incremented by 1, and `s[j]` is updated to its new value.
