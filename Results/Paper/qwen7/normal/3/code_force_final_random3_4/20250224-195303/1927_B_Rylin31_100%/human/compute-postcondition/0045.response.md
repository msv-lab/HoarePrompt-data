Output State: **`array` must contain at least one element; `s[j]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code `s[j] += 1` increments the value of `s[j]` by 1. The initial state of `array` and the way `ans` is defined (as `ans` plus the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97`) do not get directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is that `s[j]` is now one more than its original value.
