Output State: `count` is the sum of all values obtained by `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` for each `num` in `arr`, `residue_map` is a dictionary where each key is a tuple `(r_x, r_y)` and the value is the count of how many times that specific tuple has been encountered, `r_x` is `-num % x` for each `num` in `arr`, `r_y` is `num % y` for each `num` in `arr`, `current_key` is updated to `(num % x, num % y)` for each `num` in `arr`, and `num` is the last element processed in `arr` after all iterations of the loop.

This means that `count` will hold the total occurrences of each unique combination of `r_x` and `r_y` values derived from the elements in `arr`. The `residue_map` will contain every unique `(r_x, r_y)` pair found in the array along with their respective counts.
