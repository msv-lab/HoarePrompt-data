Output State: **`count` is 0 + residue_map.get((-num % x, num % y), 0), `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `num` must be defined, `arr` must be a non-empty list, `r_y` is `num % y`, `r_x` is `-num % x`.**

In this output state, the value of `count` is updated by adding the result of `residue_map.get((-num % x, num % y), 0)` to its current value (which is 0). The other variables remain unchanged: `residue_map` is still an empty dictionary, `num` is still defined, `arr` is still a non-empty list, `r_y` is still `num % y`, and `r_x` is still `-num % x`.
