You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) representing the size of the array and Polycarp's favorite integers, followed by a list of n integers representing the elements of the array. The length of each tuple is n + 3, and it is guaranteed that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

    #State: `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` after processing all arrays in `test_cases`. `residue_map` is a dictionary containing the count of each unique `(r_x, r_y)` pair across all arrays. `count` is the sum of all values obtained from `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` for each `num` in all arrays. `current_key` is the last computed key `num % x, num % y` from the final iteration of the loop over all arrays. `r_x` is `-num % x` and `r_y` is `num % y` for each `num` in all arrays.
    return results
    #The program returns a list `results` containing the final value of `count` after processing all arrays in `test_cases`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples `test_cases`, where each tuple contains the size of the array `n`, and two integers `x` and `y`, followed by a list of `n` integers representing the elements of the array. It processes each array to count the number of pairs `(r_x, r_y)` where `r_x = -num % x` and `r_y = num % y` for each element `num` in the array. The function returns a list `results` containing the total count of such pairs for each array in `test_cases`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The provided program reads multiple test cases from standard input, which matches the problem statement.
2. It correctly parses each test case, extracting the necessary values (n, x, y, and the array).
3. The `func_1` function is responsible for calculating the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.
4. In `func_1`, it uses a dictionary (`residue_map`) to keep track of the residues of each element modulo x and y.
5. For each element in the array, it calculates the required residues and checks if there are any previous elements with matching residues, incrementing the count accordingly.
6. The logic for calculating residues and checking conditions is correct according to the problem statement.
7. The program outputs the results for each test case as specified.

Given the above points, the program appears to implement the solution correctly based on the problem description.
