Output State: **`count` is updated by adding the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with key `(-num % x, num % y)` mapped to `1 + residue_map.get(current_key, 0)`, `current_key` is `num % x, num % y`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `num` is the next element in `arr`, `r_x` is calculated as `-num % x`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `r_x` as `-num % x`. This value is used in the subsequent steps to update the `count` and `residue_map`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
