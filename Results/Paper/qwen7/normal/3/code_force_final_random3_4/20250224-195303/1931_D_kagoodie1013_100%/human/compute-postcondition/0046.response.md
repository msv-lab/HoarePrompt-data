Output State: `count` is the sum of all values of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` for each `num` in `arr` plus the number of times each unique `(r_x, r_y)` pair appears in `arr`; `residue_map` is a dictionary where each key is a unique `(r_x, r_y)` pair and the value is the count of how many times that pair appears in `arr`; `current_key` is the last computed `(num % x, num % y)` pair; `r_x` is `-num % x` for the last processed `num`; `r_y` is `num % y` for the last processed `num`; `num` is the last element in `arr`.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `count` will have accumulated the sum of all occurrences of each unique `(r_x, r_y)` pair in the array `arr`, and `residue_map` will contain the frequency of each such pair.
