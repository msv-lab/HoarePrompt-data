Output State: **`count` is `count + residue_map.get((num % x, r_y), 0) + 1`, `residue_map` is `{(current_key, 1)}`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `num` is the next element in `arr`, `r_x` is `-num % x`**.

Explanation: The code snippet updates the value of `r_y` to be `num % y`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the updated state includes the new value for `r_y`, while keeping the rest of the variables in their original form with the understanding that `count`, `residue_map`, `current_key`, `num`, and `r_x` retain their initial relationships and values.
