Output State: **`count` is updated by adding the value of `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, `residue_map` is a dictionary with key `(-num % x, num % y)` mapped to `1 + residue_map.get(current_key, 0)`, `current_key` is `num % x, num % y`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `residue_map[current_key]` by incrementing it by 1. Since `current_key` is `num % x, num % y`, and `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)` is initially `1` (as per the initial state), the new value of `residue_map[current_key]` becomes `1 + residue_map.get(current_key, 0)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
