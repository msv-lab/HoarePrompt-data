Output State: **`count` is 0, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `num` must be defined, `arr` must be a non-empty list, `r_y` is `num % y`, `r_x` is `-num % x`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `num % y` to `r_y`. The other variables (`count`, `residue_map`, `num`, `arr`, and `r_x`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `r_x` is also preserved as `-num % x`, which was determined before the code execution.
