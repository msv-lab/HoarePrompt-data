Output State: **`arr` must contain at least one element, `num` is the next element in `arr`, `current_key` is `(num % x, num % y)`, `r_x` is `-(num % x)`, `r_y` is `num % y + num % y`, `residue_map[current_key]` is the value of `residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1`**.

Explanation: The code snippet only updates the value of `r_y` to be `num % y`. All other variables and their relationships remain unchanged. Therefore, `r_y` is now updated to `num % y`, but since it was already `num % y` before, the value of `r_y` remains the same. The other variables and their states are as described in the initial state.
