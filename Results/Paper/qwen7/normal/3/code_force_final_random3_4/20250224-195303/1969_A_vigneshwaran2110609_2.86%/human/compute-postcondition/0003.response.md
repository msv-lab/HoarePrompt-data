Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be between 2 and 50 inclusive, `x` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `l` by mapping each element of the input string (after stripping whitespace) into an integer. The original values of `i`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged. The new list `l` contains the integer values from the input string.
