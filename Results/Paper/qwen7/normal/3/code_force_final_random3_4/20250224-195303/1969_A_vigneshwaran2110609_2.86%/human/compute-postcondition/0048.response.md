Output State: **`i` is 11, `x` is an input integer, `n` is greater than 10, `l` is a list of integers entered by the user, `flag` is True**

Explanation: The code `x = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `x`. The values of `i`, `n`, `l`, and `flag` remain unchanged from their initial states.
