Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if `n` is between 2 and 50, and if all elements in `p` are distinct integers between 1 and `n`, not equal to their index. If any element `l[j]` in the list satisfies `l[l[j] - 1] == l[j] - 1`, it prints 2. Otherwise, it prints 3. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
