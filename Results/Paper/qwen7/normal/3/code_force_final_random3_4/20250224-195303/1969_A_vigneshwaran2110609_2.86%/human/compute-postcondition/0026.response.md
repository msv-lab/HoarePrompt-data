Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be the same as before, `x` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers entered by the user, `flag` is True**

Explanation: The code `l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` takes a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list named `l`. The values of other variables (`i`, `n`, `x`, and `flag`) remain unchanged. Since the input is not specified, `l` will be a list of integers based on the user's input.
