Output State: **`results` contains `best_y`, `max_sum` retains its value, `best_y` retains its value, `x` retains its value, `y` retains its value, `gcd_val` retains its value, `current_sum` retains its value.**

Explanation: The line of code `results.append(best_y)` appends the value of `best_y` to the list `results`. No other changes are made to the variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `max_sum`, `x`, `y`, `gcd_val`, and `current_sum` remain unchanged. The list `results` now contains the value of `best_y`.
