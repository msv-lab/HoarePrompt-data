Output State: **`max_sum` is updated to `current_sum`, `best_y` is `x - 2`, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is `x - 3`, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, x - 3)`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 3)`**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Initially, `current_sum` is defined as `gcd_val + (x - 3)`.
2. The code updates `current_sum` to `gcd_val + y`.
3. Since `y` is defined as `x - 3`, the new value of `current_sum` becomes `gcd_val + (x - 3)`.
4. All other variables (`max_sum`, `best_y`, `x`, `y`, and `gcd_val`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with `current_sum` being updated to `gcd_val + (x - 3)`.
