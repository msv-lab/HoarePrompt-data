Output State: **The program returns a list `results` containing the best `y` value for each `x` in `test_cases` after processing all iterations of the loop. Each `best_y` corresponds to the `y` that maximizes the sum of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` plus `y` (i.e., `gcd_val + y`) for its respective `x`.**

This means that for each `x` in `test_cases`, the program finds the `y` that gives the highest possible value of `gcd(x, y) + y` and appends that `y` to the list `results`. The list `results` will have as many elements as there are `x` values in `test_cases`, with each element being the optimal `y` found for the corresponding `x`.
