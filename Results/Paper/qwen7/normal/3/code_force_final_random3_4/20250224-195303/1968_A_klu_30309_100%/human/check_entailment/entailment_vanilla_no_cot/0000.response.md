Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to be correct based on the problem description. It correctly implements the logic to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \leq y < x \)) such that the sum of the greatest common divisor of \( x \) and \( y \) plus \( y \) is maximized. The program iterates through all possible values of \( y \) from \( x-1 \) down to 1, calculates the gcd for each pair \((x, y)\), and keeps track of the \( y \) that gives the maximum sum. If multiple \( y \) values give the same maximum sum, it selects the first one found, which is allowed according to the problem statement.
