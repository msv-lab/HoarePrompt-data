Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):`. The variables involved here are `y` and `x`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `max_sum` is 0.
   - `best_y` is 1.
   - `x` is the next value from `test_cases`.
   - `y` and `results` remain unchanged.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will run as long as `y` is within the range defined by `range(x - 1, 0, -1)`. This means `y` should start from `x - 1` and decrement until it reaches 0.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `x` must be a positive integer because the range function requires the start value to be greater than the stop value (0 in this case).
   - `y` must start from `x - 1` and decrement until it reaches 0.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `x` and `y`.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is `x - 1`**.
