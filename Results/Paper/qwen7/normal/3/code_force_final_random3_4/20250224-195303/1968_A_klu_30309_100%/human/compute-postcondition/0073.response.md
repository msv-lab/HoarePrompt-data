Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `y` in the range `range(x - 1, 0, -1)`. This means `y` starts from `x - 1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches 0.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `y` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `y` was `x - 1`.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `y` starts from `x - 1` and decrements by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `y` will be `x - 2`.
   - The value of `x` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop head.
   - The other variables (`max_sum`, `best_y`, `gcd_val`, `current_sum`) are not part of the loop head and thus their values remain the same unless modified within the loop body, which is not specified here.

Given the above points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `y` decreases by 1, so `y` becomes `x - 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum`, `best_y` is `x - 1`, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is `x - 2`, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, x - 1)`, `current_sum` is `math.gcd(x, x - 1) + y`**.
