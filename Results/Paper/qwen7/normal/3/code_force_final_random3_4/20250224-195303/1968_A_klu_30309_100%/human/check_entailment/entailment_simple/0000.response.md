Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the list of integers `test_cases` where each integer `x` is within the specified range (2 ≤ x ≤ 1000).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates over each `x` in `test_cases`.
   - For each `x`, it initializes `max_sum` to 0 and `best_y` to 1.
   - It then iterates over all possible `y` values from `x-1` down to 1.
   - For each `y`, it calculates the greatest common divisor (`gcd_val`) of `x` and `y`.
   - It computes the sum `current_sum` of `gcd_val` and `y`.
   - If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and sets `best_y` to `y`, then breaks out of the inner loop to avoid unnecessary calculations.
   - After processing all `y` values for a given `x`, it appends `best_y` to the `results` list.
   - This process ensures that for each `x`, the corresponding `y` that maximizes the sum of the greatest common divisor plus `y` is found and stored.

3. **Output**:
   - The function returns the list `results` which contains the optimal `y` for each `x` in `test_cases`.
   - The main part of the program then prints each element in `results`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `x` is 2 correctly, as the only possible `y` is 1, and `gcd(2, 1) + 1 = 2`, which is the maximum possible sum for `x=2`.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal `y` for each `x` such that the sum of the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` plus `y` is maximized.

Correctness: **True**
