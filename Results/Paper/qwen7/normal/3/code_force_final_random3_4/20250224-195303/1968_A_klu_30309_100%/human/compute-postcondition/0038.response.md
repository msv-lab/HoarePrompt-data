Output State: **`gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `x-1`, `y` is `x-1`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `max_sum` is `gcd_val + y`, `best_y` is `x-1`**.

Explanation: The line `best_y = y` assigns the value of `y` (which is `x-1`) to the variable `best_y`. All other variables (`gcd_val`, `y`, `current_sum`, and `max_sum`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
