Output State: **`max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is the last value of `y` processed in the loop, `x` is the next value of `x` in `test_cases`, `y` is the last value of `y` processed in the loop, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, and `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`.**

Explanation: The line `max_sum = 0` initializes the variable `max_sum` to 0. This does not affect the values of `results`, `t`, `test_cases`, `best_y`, `x`, `y`, `gcd_val`, or `current_sum`. The values of these variables remain as they were in the initial state.
