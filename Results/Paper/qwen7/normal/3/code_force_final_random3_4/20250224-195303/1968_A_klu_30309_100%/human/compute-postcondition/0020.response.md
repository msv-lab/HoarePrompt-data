Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `test_cases` is a list of positive integers such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\) for each \(x\) in `test_cases`, `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum` if `current_sum > max_sum`, `best_y` is `x - 2` if `current_sum > max_sum`, `x` is at least 2, `y` is \(x - 3\), `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and \(y = x - 2\), `current_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + (x - 2)` or `gcd_val + (x - 3)` depending on the loop body, `math.gcd(x, y)` is calculated and stored in `gcd_val`.**

The code calculates the greatest common divisor (`gcd_val`) of `x` and `y` (where `y = x - 3`). This value is then stored in `gcd_val`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
