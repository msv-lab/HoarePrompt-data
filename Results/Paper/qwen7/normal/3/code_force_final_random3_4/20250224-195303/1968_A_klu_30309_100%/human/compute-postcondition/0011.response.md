Postcondition: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `test_cases` is a list of positive integers such that \(2 \leq x \leq 1000\) for each \(x\) in `test_cases`, and `test_cases` must have at least one element, `max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum` if `current_sum > max_sum`, `best_y` is `y` if `current_sum > max_sum`, `x` is at least 2, `y` is \(x - 1\), `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`. If `current_sum <= max_sum`, the values of `max_sum`, `best_y`, `x`, `y`, `gcd_val`, and `current_sum` remain unchanged.**
