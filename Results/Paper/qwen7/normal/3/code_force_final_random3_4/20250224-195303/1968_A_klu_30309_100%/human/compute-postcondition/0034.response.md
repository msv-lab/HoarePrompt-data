Output State: **`gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `x-1`, `y` is `x-1`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + y`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `gcd_val + y` to `current_sum`. Given that `y` is `x-1` and `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `x-1`, the value of `current_sum` is calculated as `gcd_val + (x-1)`. The values of `gcd_val` and `y` remain unchanged, and `current_sum` is now set to their sum.
