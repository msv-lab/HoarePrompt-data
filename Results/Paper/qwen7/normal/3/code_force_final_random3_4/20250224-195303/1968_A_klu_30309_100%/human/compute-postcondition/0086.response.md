Postcondition: `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum`, `best_y` is `y`, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is `x - 3`, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, x - 3)`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 3)`, and either `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or there is no change in `max_sum` and `best_y` remains the same.
