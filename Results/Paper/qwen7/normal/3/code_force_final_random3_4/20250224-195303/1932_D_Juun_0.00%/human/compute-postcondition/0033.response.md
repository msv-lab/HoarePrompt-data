Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trumps` is a list containing the value of `rank`, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values all set to `None`, `answers` is a list containing one element which is a string formed by joining the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with spaces, `rank` is the first element of `card`, `suit` is the second element of `card`.**

Explanation: The code appends to the `answers` list a string created by joining the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with spaces. Since `suits[suit]` is initially `None`, the sorted list will be `[None, rank]`. The string will be `'None rank'`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `trumps`, `suits`, `rank`, or `suit`.
