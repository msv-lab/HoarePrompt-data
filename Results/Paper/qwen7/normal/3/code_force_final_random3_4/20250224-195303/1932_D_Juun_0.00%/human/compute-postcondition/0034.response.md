Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trumps` is a list containing the value of `rank`, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values all set to `None`, `answers` is a list containing one element which is a string formed by joining the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with spaces, `rank` is the first element of `card`, `suit` is the second element of `card`, `suits[suit]` is set to `None`.**

The code `suits[suit] = None` sets the value of `suits[suit]` to `None`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
