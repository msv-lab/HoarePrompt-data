Postcondition: `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values all set to `None` (one key-value pair processed), `trumps` is a list with one less element than before, `answers` is a list with one new element which is a string formatted as 'rank{suit} trumps.pop()trump'. This is true regardless of whether `rank` is `None` or not, as the if part handles the case where `rank` is `None` by continuing the loop with the updated states of `suits`, `trumps`, and `answers`.
