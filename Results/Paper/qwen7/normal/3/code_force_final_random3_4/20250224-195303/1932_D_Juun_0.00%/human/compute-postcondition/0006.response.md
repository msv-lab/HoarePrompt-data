Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is one of "CDHS", `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is an empty list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values all set to None, `rank` is the rank of the card, `suit` is the suit of the card.**

Explanation: The code `rank, suit = card` unpacks the tuple `card` into two variables, `rank` and `suit`. This means that `rank` now holds the rank of the card and `suit` holds the suit of the card. All other variables remain unchanged.
