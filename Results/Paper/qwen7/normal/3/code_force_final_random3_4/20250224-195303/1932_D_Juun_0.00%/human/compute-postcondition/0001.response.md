Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is one of "CDHS", and we read the next line of input which will contain 2n unique cards described by two-character strings where the first character is the rank ("23456789") and the second character is the suit ("CDHS"); `trump` is assigned the value of the input string.**

The code assigns the value of the input string to the variable `trump`. The values of `t`, `n`, and the description of the next line of input remain unchanged.
