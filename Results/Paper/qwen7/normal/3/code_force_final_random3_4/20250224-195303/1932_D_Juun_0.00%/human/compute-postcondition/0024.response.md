Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is one of "CDHS", `trumps` is an empty list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values all set to `None`, `answers` is a list containing one element which is a string formed by joining the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank` for each suit in 'CDHS', `card` is a tuple where the first element is assigned to `rank` and the second element is assigned to `suit`.**

Explanation: The code appends a string to the `answers` list. This string is created by sorting the values of `suits[suit]` and `rank` for each suit ('C', 'D', 'H', 'S') and then joining them with a space. Since `suits[suit]` is `None` for all suits, the sorted values will be `[None, rank]` for each suit. Therefore, the string appended to `answers` will be `'None rank'` repeated four times (once for each suit). The `card` tuple remains unchanged.
