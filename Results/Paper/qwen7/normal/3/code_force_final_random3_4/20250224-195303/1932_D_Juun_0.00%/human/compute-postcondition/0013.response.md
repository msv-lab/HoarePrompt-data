Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is one of "CDHS", `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is a list containing one element which is a string formed by joining the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank` with the suit, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values all set to None, `rank` is the rank of the card, `suit` is the suit of the card, and `suit` is not equal to the trump suit, the current value of `suits[suit]` is not None.**

Explanation: The code appends to the `answers` list a string created by sorting the values of `suits[suit]` and `rank` and then joining them with the suit. Since `suits[suit]` is not None, it is included in the sorted list along with `rank`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
