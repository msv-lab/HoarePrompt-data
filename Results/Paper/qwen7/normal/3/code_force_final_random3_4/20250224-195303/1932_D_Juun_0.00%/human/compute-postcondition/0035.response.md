Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trumps` is a list containing the value of `rank`, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values set to the value of `rank`, `answers` is an empty list, `rank` is the first element of `card`, `suit` is the second element of `card`.**

Explanation: The code `suits[suit] = rank` updates the dictionary `suits` by setting the value of the key `suit` (which is either 'C', 'D', 'H', or 'S') to the value of `rank`. The other variables remain unchanged.
