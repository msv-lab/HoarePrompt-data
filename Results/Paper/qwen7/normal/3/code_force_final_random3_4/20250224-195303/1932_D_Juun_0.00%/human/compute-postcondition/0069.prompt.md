Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is one of "CDHS". `trumps` is a list containing all ranks of cards that had the same suit as the trump suit, sorted in ascending order. `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values all set to `None`. `answers` is a list containing strings formed by joining the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank` for each suit in 'CDHS', where each string is formed only once per unique pair of `suits[suit]` and `rank`.
Code of the loop:
for suit, rank in suits.items():
    if rank is None:
        continue
    if trumps != []:
        answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
    else:
        print('IMPOSSIBLE')
        return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values all set to `None`; `trumps` is a list with one less element than before; `answers` is a list with one new element which is a string formatted as 'rank{suit} trumps.pop()trump'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values all set to `None`; `trumps` is a list with one less element than before; `answers` is a list with one new element which is a string formatted as 'rank{suit} trumps.pop()trump'; the loop continues regardless of whether `rank` is `None` or not.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values all set to `None` (one key-value pair processed), `trumps` is a list with one less element than before, `answers` is a list with one new element which is a string formatted as 'rank{suit} trumps.pop()trump'. This is true regardless of whether `rank` is `None` or not, as the if part handles the case where `rank` is `None` by continuing the loop with the updated states of `suits`, `trumps`, and `answers`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
