Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1()` correctly processes the input for each test case.
2. It initializes the necessary variables and correctly handles the sorting and processing of the cards.
3. The logic for determining which card beats another is correct, considering both the rank and suit conditions, including the special rule for the trump suit.
4. The function handles the case where a solution is impossible by printing "IMPOSSIBLE" when appropriate.
5. The function ensures that all cards are accounted for in the output, either by matching non-trump cards with trump cards or by indicating impossibility.

Given the detailed analysis, the function appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
