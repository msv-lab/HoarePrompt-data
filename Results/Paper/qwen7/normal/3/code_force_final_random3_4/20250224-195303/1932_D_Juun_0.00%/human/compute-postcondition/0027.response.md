Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is one of "CDHS", `trumps` is an empty list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values either `None` or an integer, `answers` is a list containing one element which is a string formed by joining the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank` for each suit in 'CDHS', `card` is a tuple where the first element is assigned to `rank` and the second element is assigned to `suit`. If `suits[suit]` is `None`, `answers` contains a string formed by joining the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank` for each suit in 'CDHS'. If `suits[suit]` is not `None`, `suits[suit]` is updated to `rank` for the given `suit` and `rank`.**
