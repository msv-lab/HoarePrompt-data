You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is one of "CDHS", and the third line contains 2n unique cards described by two-character strings where the first character is the rank ("23456789") and the second character is the suit ("CDHS").
def func_1():
    input()
    trump = input()
    trumps = []
    answers = []
    suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}
    for card in input().split():
        rank, suit = card
        
        if suit == trump:
            trumps.append(rank)
        elif suits[suit] is not None:
            answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))
            suits[suit] = None
        else:
            suits[suit] = rank
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is one of "CDHS". `trumps` is a list containing all ranks of cards that had the same suit as the trump suit, sorted in ascending order. `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values all set to `None`. `answers` is a list containing strings formed by joining the sorted values of `suits[suit]` and `rank` for each suit in 'CDHS', where each string is formed only once per unique pair of `suits[suit]` and `rank`.
    for (suit, rank) in suits.items():
        if rank is None:
            continue
        
        if trumps != []:
            answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        else:
            print('IMPOSSIBLE')
            return
        
    #State: All keys in the `suits` dictionary are set to `None`; `trumps` is an empty list; `answers` is a list containing 16 unique strings, each formatted as 'rank{suit} trumps.pop()trump'.
    trumps = sorted(trumps)
    while trumps != []:
        print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        
    #State: Output State: `trumps` is an empty list, `suits` dictionary keys are set to `None`, `answers` is a list containing 16 unique strings, each formatted as 'rank{suit} trumps.pop()trump'.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `trumps` is not an empty list. Since each iteration removes two elements from `trumps` (i.e., `trumps.pop()` is called twice per iteration), and there were initially 16 elements in `trumps` (since `answers` contains 16 unique strings), the loop will execute exactly 8 times (16 elements / 2 elements removed per iteration). After these 8 iterations, `trumps` will be an empty list. The other variables (`suits` and `answers`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by the loop.
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)
        
    #State: Output State: `answer` is the eighth element in the `answers` list, `answers` is a list containing 15 unique strings, each formatted as 'rank{suit} trumps.pop()trump', `trumps` is an empty list, `suits` dictionary keys are set to `None`.
    #
    #Explanation: After 8 iterations of the loop, all 16 elements from the `answers` list have been printed, with two elements being processed in each iteration. Therefore, `answer` will be the eighth element in the original `answers` list. The `trumps` list is emptied after 8 iterations since 16 elements were removed (2 per iteration). The `suits` dictionary remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop. The `answers` list is reduced to 15 elements after the last iteration, as 16 - 8 (iterations) * 2 (elements per iteration) = 0 elements remain.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It processes a dictionary `suits` and lists `trumps` and `answers` based on certain conditions but does not return any value. The dictionary `suits` is updated to have all values set to None, the list `trumps` is modified to have one less element, and the list `answers` gains a new element formatted as 'rank{suit} trumps.pop()trump'. The function then continues to the next iteration of the loop without returning any specific value.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns None

Case_2: The program does not return any value since there is no return statement in the given code snippet. The dictionary 'suits' remains unchanged with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values all set to None; the list 'trumps' is modified to have one less element; the list 'answers' gains a new element formatted as 'rank{suit} trumps.pop()trump'; and the loop continues regardless of the value of 'rank'.

Case_3: The program returns None since there is no value being returned in the given code snippet. The code only modifies the states of `suits`, `trumps`, and `answers` but does not return any specific value.
