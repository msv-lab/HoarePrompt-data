Postcondition: **`is_already_stairs` remains False, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers of length n, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= start_index < n, `res` is a list that will store the operations performed, and for every `j` in the range `0` to `17`, the condition `arr[start_index + j] == j` still does not hold true. If `arr[start_index + i] == i` is true, then the function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called. Otherwise, the elements in the array `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + i + 1` are all set to the value `i-1`, and the list `res` contains tuples indicating these operations.**
