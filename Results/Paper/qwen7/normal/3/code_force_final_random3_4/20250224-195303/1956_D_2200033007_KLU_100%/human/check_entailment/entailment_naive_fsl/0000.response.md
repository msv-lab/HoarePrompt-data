Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The problem requires maximizing the sum of the array elements by performing operations to make segments of the array equal to the MEX of that segment. However, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not seem to implement the logic required to achieve this.

- `func_1` appears to be attempting to find the maximum possible sum using a recursive approach, but it does not correctly calculate the MEX for each segment or update the array accordingly.
- `func_2` seems to be trying to find the operations needed to achieve the maximum sum, but it does not correctly generate the operations or update the array to reflect the MEX values.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
