Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function aims to find the maximum possible sum of a subarray by considering different ways to partition the array and computing the sum of the subarrays plus the MEX value for each partition. However, the logic of this function seems flawed because it does not correctly compute the MEX value and the maximum sum. The current implementation uses a divide-and-conquer approach but does not properly handle the MEX calculation, which is crucial for the problem's solution.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function is supposed to generate the sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum. However, the logic here also appears incorrect. It attempts to find the optimal partitioning of the array but does not correctly implement the MEX calculation or the logic to ensure the maximum sum is achieved. The function `make_stairs` is intended to adjust the array to form a "stairs" pattern, but it does not seem to correctly compute the MEX value or adjust the array to achieve the maximum sum.

Given the descriptions of the functions and the provided comments, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The functions do not accurately compute the MEX value or the maximum sum of the array elements after performing the allowed operations.

Correctness: **False**
