Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires maximizing the sum of an array by performing a specific operation no more than \(5 \times 10^5\) times. The operation involves setting all elements in a subarray to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of that subarray.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1(start_index, end_index)**: This function calculates the maximum possible sum of the subarray from `start_index` to `end_index` using dynamic programming and memoization. It correctly handles the base cases and recursive cases to find the optimal solution.
   - **func_2(start_index, end_index)**: This function determines the operations needed to achieve the maximum sum calculated by `func_1`. It checks if the current subarray can be directly set to the maximum value or if it needs to be split into smaller subarrays to achieve the maximum sum. The logic seems correct but might have some inefficiencies due to the recursive nature and the way it handles splitting the array.
   - **make_stairs(i)**: This function sets the elements of the array to form a staircase pattern starting from the beginning of the array. It ensures that the elements are set to their respective indices, which helps in achieving the maximum sum. However, the function's implementation seems to be incomplete as it lacks a return statement in several places.

3. **Overall Logic**:
   - The overall logic of the program seems to be correct in terms of finding the maximum sum and constructing the operations to achieve it. However, there are a few potential issues:
     - The `make_stairs` function is incomplete and may not work as intended.
     - The recursive calls in `func_2` might lead to unnecessary computations and could potentially exceed the \(5 \times 10^5\) operation limit for large arrays.

Given the above analysis, the core logic of the program appears to be sound, but there are some potential issues with the implementation details, particularly in the `make_stairs` function.

Correctness: **False**
