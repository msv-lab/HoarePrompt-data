Output State: **`is_already_stairs` remains False, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers of length n, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= start_index < n, `res` is a list that will store the operations performed, and for every `j` in the range `0` to `17`, the condition `arr[start_index + j] == j` still does not hold true. Additionally, `arr[start_index + i] != i`. `make_stairs(i - 1)` is called.**

Explanation: The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` is called with `i - 1` as an argument. Since the function call itself does not modify the variables listed in the initial state, the values of `is_already_stairs`, `arr`, `start_index`, `res`, and the conditions related to `arr[start_index + j]` and `arr[start_index + i]` remain unchanged. The only change is that the function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called.
