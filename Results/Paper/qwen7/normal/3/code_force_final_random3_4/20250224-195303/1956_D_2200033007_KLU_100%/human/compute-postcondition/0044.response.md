Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `i`. It does not return any value since no return statement is provided. The state remains as follows: `is_already_stairs` is set to False, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers with the element at `start_index` set to 1, `res` contains the tuple `(start_index, start_index)`, and `i` is still 0.**
