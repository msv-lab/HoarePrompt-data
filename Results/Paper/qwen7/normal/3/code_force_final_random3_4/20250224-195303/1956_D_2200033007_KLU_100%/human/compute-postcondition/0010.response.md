Output State: **`is_already_stairs` is False, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers of length n, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= start_index < n, `res` is a list that will store the operations performed, `j` is 2, `i` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 17, and the value of `arr[start_index + j]` is not equal to 2.**

Explanation: The code sets `is_already_stairs` to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
