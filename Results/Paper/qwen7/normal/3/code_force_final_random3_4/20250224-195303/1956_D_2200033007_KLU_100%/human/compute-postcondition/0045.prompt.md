You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers of length n, where n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 18, and start_index is an integer such that 0 <= start_index < n, and res is a list that will store the operations performed.
def make_stairs(i):
    is_already_stairs = True
    for j in range(i + 1):
        if arr[start_index + j] != j:
            is_already_stairs = False
        
    #State: Output State: `is_already_stairs` remains True, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers of length n, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= start_index < n, `res` is a list that will store the operations performed, and after the loop has executed all its iterations, no value in `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + i` (where `i` ranges from 0 to 17) is found to be unequal to its index `j`. This means that for every `j` in the range `0` to `17`, the condition `arr[start_index + j] == j` holds true throughout the entire execution of the loop.
    if is_already_stairs :
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State: `is_already_stairs` remains False, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers of length n, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= start_index < n, `res` is a list that will store the operations performed, and for every `j` in the range `0` to `17`, the condition `arr[start_index + j] == j` does not hold true throughout the entire execution of the loop.
    if (i == 0) :
        res.append((start_index, start_index))
        arr[start_index] = 1
        return
        #The program does not return any value since no return statement is provided. The state remains as follows: `is_already_stairs` is False, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers with the element at `start_index` set to 1, `res` contains the tuple `(start_index, start_index)`, and `i` is still 0.
    #State: Postcondition: `is_already_stairs` remains False, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers of length n, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= start_index < n, `res` is a list that will store the operations performed, and for every `j` in the range `0` to `17`, the condition `arr[start_index + j] == j` still does not hold true.
    if (arr[start_index + i] == i) :
        make_stairs(i - 1)
    else :
        make_stairs(i - 1)
        res.append((start_index, start_index + i))
        for j in range(start_index, start_index + i + 1):
            arr[j] = i
            
        #State: Output State: The loop will continue to increment `j` from `start_index` up to `start_index + i + 1`. After all iterations, `j` will reach `start_index + i + 1`, and every element in the array `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + i + 1` will be set to the value `i`. The variable `res` will contain tuples of the form `(start_index, start_index + k)` for each `k` in the range `0` to `i + 1`. The variable `is_already_stairs` will remain `False`, and `start_index` and `i` will retain their final values after the loop completes.
        #
        #In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing, the elements in the array `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + i + 1` will all be set to the value `i`. The list `res` will contain tuples indicating the operations performed, and the other variables will retain their values from the last iteration of the loop.
        make_stairs(i - 1)
    #State: `is_already_stairs` remains False, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers of length n, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= start_index < n, `res` is a list that will store the operations performed, and for every `j` in the range `0` to `17`, the condition `arr[start_index + j] == j` still does not hold true. If `arr[start_index + i] == i` is true, then the function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called. Otherwise, the elements in the array `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + i + 1` are all set to the value `i-1`, and the list `res` contains tuples indicating these operations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `i`. It does not return any value since no return statement is provided. The state remains as follows: `is_already_stairs` is set to False, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers with the element at `start_index` set to 1, `res` contains the tuple `(start_index, start_index)`, and `i` is still 0.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns None

Case_2: The program does not return any value since no return statement is provided. The state remains as follows: `is_already_stairs` is False, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers with the element at `start_index` set to 1, `res` contains the tuple `(start_index, start_index)`, and `i` is still 0.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
