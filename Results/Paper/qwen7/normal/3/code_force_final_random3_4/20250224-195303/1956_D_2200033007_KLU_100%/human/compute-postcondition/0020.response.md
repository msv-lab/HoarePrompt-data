Output State: **`is_already_stairs` remains False, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers of length n, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= start_index < n, `res` is a list that will store the operations performed, and the current value of `i` is 0; `res` now contains the tuple `(start_index, start_index)`**.

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(start_index, start_index)` to the list `res`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
