Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `j` and `start_index`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for values of `j` from `start_index` to `start_index + i + 1` (inclusive).

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is equal to `i`.
   - `j` must be less than or equal to `start_index + i + 1`.

4. **Determine the next value of `j`**:
   - Since `j` starts from `start_index` and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `j` will be `i + 1`.

5. **Check the new condition**:
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must still be less than or equal to `start_index + i + 1`.
   - Given that `j` is now `i + 1`, we need to ensure that `i + 1` is less than or equal to `start_index + i + 1`.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `j` will be `i + 1`.
   - `j` must still be less than or equal to `start_index + i + 1`.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`j` is `i + 1`, `j` must be less than or equal to `start_index + i + 1`**.
