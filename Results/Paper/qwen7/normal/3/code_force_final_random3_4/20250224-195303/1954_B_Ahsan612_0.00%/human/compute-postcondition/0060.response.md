Output State: **`minn` is set to infinity, `ar` is a list of integers created from the input, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 3, `num` is `ar[2]`, `same` is 1, and `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code `num = ar[i]` updates the value of `num` to be the value of `ar[i]`, where `i` is initially 2. Therefore, `num` is now `ar[2]`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, making it 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
