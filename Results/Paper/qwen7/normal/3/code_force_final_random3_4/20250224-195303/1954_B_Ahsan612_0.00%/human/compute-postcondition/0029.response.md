Output State: **`same` is either 3 or 4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `minn` is the minimum value found in the list `ar`, `i` must be less than `len(ar) - 1`**.

Explanation: The value of `same` is incremented by 1, changing its value from either 2 or 3 to either 3 or 4. The values of `t`, `n`, `ar`, `minn`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code snippet.
