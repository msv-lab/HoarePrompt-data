Output State: **`same` is either 2 or 3, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `minn` is the minimum value found in the list `ar`, `i` is `i + 1` and is less than `len(ar) - 1`.**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the exact value of `i` is not specified in the initial state. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
