Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(ar)`.
2. **Current States**:
   - `i` is either 6 or 7.
   - `same` is either 2, 3, or 4.
   - `minn` is 1 if `i` is 7.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`.

4. **Analyze the Current Values**:
   - If `i` is 6, then for the loop to execute again, `len(ar)` must be greater than 6.
   - If `i` is 7, then for the loop to execute again, `len(ar)` must be greater than 7.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` can be either 6 or 7, we need to ensure that `len(ar)` is greater than the maximum possible value of `i` (which is 7).
   - Therefore, `len(ar)` must be greater than 7.

6. **Other Variables**:
   - The values of `same` and `minn` do not affect the loop condition directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `len(ar)`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is either 6 or 7, `same` is either 2, 3, or 4, `minn` is 1 if `i` is 7, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 7**.
