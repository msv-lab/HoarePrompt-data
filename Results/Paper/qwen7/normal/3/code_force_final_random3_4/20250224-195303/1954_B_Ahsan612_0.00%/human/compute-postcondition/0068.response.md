Output State: **`i` is 6, `same` is 3 if `ar[4]` equals `num`, otherwise `same` remains 1**

Explanation: The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 5 to 6. The value of `same` remains unchanged because the code snippet does not affect the condition that determines its value. Therefore, `same` is still 3 if `ar[4]` equals `num`, otherwise it remains 1.
