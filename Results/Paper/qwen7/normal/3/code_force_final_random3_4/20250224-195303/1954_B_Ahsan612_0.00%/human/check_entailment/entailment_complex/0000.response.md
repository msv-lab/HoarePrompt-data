Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The goal is to find the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful. However, the current implementation only finds the minimum length of consecutive occurrences of any element in the list, which is not the correct approach.

Here's a breakdown of why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Minimum Length of Consecutive Occurrences**:
   - The code increments `same` when `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, but it does not handle the case where the array is beautiful and needs to be modified to stop being beautiful.
   - The variable `minn` is set to `inf` initially, and it is updated whenever a new sequence of the same element is found. This does not account for the requirement to make the array non-beautiful.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Test Cases**:
   - The function processes each test case but does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
   - The logic does not consider the requirement to break the beauty of the array by removing elements.

3. **Output for Each Test Case**:
   - The function prints `-1` only if `minn` remains `inf` after processing the entire array, which is not the correct condition for determining the minimum number of elements to remove.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to identify the longest sequence of consecutive elements that can be made to stop being beautiful by removing the minimum number of elements. This involves identifying the longest sequence of elements that can be made to stop being beautiful by removing one element.

Correctness: **False**
