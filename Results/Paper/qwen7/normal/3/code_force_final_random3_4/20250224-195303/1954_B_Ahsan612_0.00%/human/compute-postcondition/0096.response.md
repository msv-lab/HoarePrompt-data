Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of `ar` minus `n`, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and `same`, `same` is 1, `num` is the last element of `ar` if it was not equal to the previous `num` when the loop ended, otherwise, `same` can take any value from 1 to the maximum value of `same` observed during the loop, `ar` is updated with integers from the input, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `ar = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the input, converts each integer to a string, and then maps them to integers, storing the result in the list `ar`. The values of `i`, `minn`, `same`, `num`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
