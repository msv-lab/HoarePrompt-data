Output State: **`same` is either 1 or 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `minn` is the minimum value found in the list `ar`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated state includes `i` being incremented by 1, while `same`, `t`, `n`, `ar`, `minn`, and `len(ar)` retain their original values.
