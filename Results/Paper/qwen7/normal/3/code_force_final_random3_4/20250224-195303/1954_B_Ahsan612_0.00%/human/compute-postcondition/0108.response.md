Output State: **`minn` is infinity, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[i]`, `ar` is updated with integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, `i` is 3, and `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `num` to `ar[i]`. Initially, `i` was 2, and since `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, incrementing `i` by 1 makes `i` equal to 3. Now, `num` holds the value of `ar[3]`, and `ar[i]` (which is `ar[3]`) is equal to `num`. All other variables remain unchanged.
