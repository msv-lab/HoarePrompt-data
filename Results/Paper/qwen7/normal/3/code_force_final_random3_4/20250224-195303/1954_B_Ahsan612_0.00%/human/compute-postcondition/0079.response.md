Output State: **`i` is either 7 or 8, `same` is either 2, 3, or 4, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and `same`, `num` is `ar[i]`**.

Explanation: The code updates `minn` to be the minimum value between its current value and `same`. Since `same` is either 2, 3, or 4, and `minn` is 1 if `i` is 7, `minn` will be updated to the smaller value between 1 (if `i` is 7) or `same` (which is either 2, 3, or 4). The value of `num` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
