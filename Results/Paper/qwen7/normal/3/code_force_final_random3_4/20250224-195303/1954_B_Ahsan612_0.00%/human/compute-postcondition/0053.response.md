Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `while i < len(ar)`.
   - The variables involved are `i` and `len(ar)`.

2. **Determine the current state of these variables**:
   - `i` is currently set to 1.
   - `len(ar)` is the length of the list `ar`.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute if `i < len(ar)`.
   - Given `i` is currently 1, the loop will execute if `1 < len(ar)`.

4. **Adjust the state if necessary**:
   - Since `i` is 1, the loop will execute if `len(ar)` is greater than 1.
   - Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `i` because it is already set to 1.
   - We need to ensure that `len(ar)` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute the first time.

5. **State the final state before the loop**:
   - `minn` is set to infinity.
   - `ar` is a list of integers created from the input.
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `num` is `ar[0]`.
   - `same` is 1.
   - `len(ar)` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute the first time.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`minn` is set to infinity, `ar` is a list of integers created from the input, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `num` is `ar[0]`, `same` is 1, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 1**.
