Output State: **`i` is either 7 or 8; `same` is 1; `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and 4; `num` is `ar[i]`.**

Explanation: The value of `same` is directly assigned to 1. The values of `i`, `minn`, and `num` remain unchanged from their initial states. Since `same` was previously either 2, 3, or 4, after assigning it to 1, its new value is 1. The minimum value between `minn` and `same` (which is now 1) remains the minimum of `minn` and 1, but since `same` is now 1, the minimum value between `minn` and `same` is the minimum of `minn` and 1, which simplifies to the minimum of `minn` and 4 because `same` was originally either 2, 3, or 4.
