Based on the initial state provided:

- `minn` is the minimum value between 1 and 2, which remains 1.
- `same` is 2.
- `num` is the last number in the sequence (though the sequence itself is not explicitly defined, we only need `minn` for this particular print statement).
- `ar` contains the first 6 integers from the input (though the specific values of `ar` are not needed for this particular print statement).
- `i` is 6.
- `len(ar)` is 6.
- `minn` is not infinity (which is already stated as 1).

The print statement is:
```python
print(minn)
```

This statement will print the value of `minn`, which is 1.

Output: **1**
