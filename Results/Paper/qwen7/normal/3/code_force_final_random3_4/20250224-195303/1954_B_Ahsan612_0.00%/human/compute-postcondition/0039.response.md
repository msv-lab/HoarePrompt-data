Output State: **`same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of the last element in the list `ar`, `minn` is the minimum value found among the counts of consecutive occurrences of any element in the list `ar`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, and `num` is the last element of `ar`.**

Explanation: The line `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`. Since `same` represents the count of consecutive occurrences of the last element in the list `ar`, and `minn` is the minimum value found among the counts of consecutive occurrences of any element in the list `ar`, updating `minn` ensures that it remains the smallest count of consecutive occurrences of any element in the list. The values of `t`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, and `num` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
