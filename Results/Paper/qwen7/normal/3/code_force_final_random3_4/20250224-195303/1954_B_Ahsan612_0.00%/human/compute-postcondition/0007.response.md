Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `while i < len(ar)`. The variables involved are `i` and `len(ar)`.

2. **Determine the current state of these variables**:
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `len(ar)` is the length of the list `ar`.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute the first time**: The loop will execute the first time if `i < len(ar)`.

4. **Analyze the current values**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `len(ar)` is the length of the list `ar`.

5. **Determine if the loop can execute the first time**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` (which is 1) must be less than `len(ar)`.
   - This means `len(ar)` must be greater than 1.

6. **Adjust the state if necessary**:
   - Since `i` is already 1, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - We need to ensure that `len(ar)` is greater than 1.

Therefore, the state right before the loop needs to be adjusted to ensure that `len(ar)` is greater than 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`same` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `minn` is infinity, `i` is 1, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 1**.
