Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is equal to the length of `ar`.
- `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and `same`.
- `same` is 1.
- `num` is the last element of `ar` if it was not equal to the previous `num` when the loop ended, otherwise, `same` can take any value from 1 to the maximum value of `same` observed during the loop.
- `minn` is not equal to infinity.

We need to determine what will be printed when the `print(minn)` statement executes.

Given that `minn` is described as "the minimum of `minn` and `same`" and `same` is explicitly stated to be 1, we can infer that `minn` must have been set to 1 or a value that is no smaller than 1 before the current state. Since `minn` is not equal to infinity, it must have been initialized or updated to a finite value.

Therefore, the value of `minn` in the current state is 1.

Output: **1**
