Output State: `same` is between 1 and the length of `ar`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `minn` is the minimum value found in the list `ar`, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, and `num` is the last element of `ar`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `ar` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches the end of the list. The variable `same` will be the count of consecutive occurrences of the last element in the list `ar`. The variable `minn` will be the minimum value found among the counts of consecutive occurrences of any element in the list `ar`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `ar` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
