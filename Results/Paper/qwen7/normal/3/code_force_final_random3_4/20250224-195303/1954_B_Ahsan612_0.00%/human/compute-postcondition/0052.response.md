Output State: **`minn` is set to infinity, `ar` is a list of integers created from the input, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `num` is `ar[0]`, `same` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `i = 1` simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `i`. This does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the values of `minn`, `ar`, `t`, `num`, and `same` remain unchanged.
