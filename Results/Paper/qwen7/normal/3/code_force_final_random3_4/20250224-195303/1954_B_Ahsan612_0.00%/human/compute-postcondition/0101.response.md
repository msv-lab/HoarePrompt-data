Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(ar)`.
2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `minn` is infinity
   - `same` is 1
   - `num` is `ar[0]`
   - `ar` is updated with integers from the input
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `i` is 1

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - The loop will execute the first time if `i` is less than `len(ar)`.
   - Given that `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute the first time, `len(ar)` must be greater than 1.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - We need to ensure that `len(ar)` is greater than 1.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be modified to reflect this requirement.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`minn` is infinity, `same` is 1, `num` is `ar[0]`, `ar` is updated with integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, `i` is 1, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 1**
