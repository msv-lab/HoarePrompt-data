Output State: **`minn` is 1, `same` is 3, `num` is either `ar[0]` or `ar[i-1]` based on the condition, `ar` is updated with integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, `i` is 4, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 4.**

Explanation: The variable `same` was originally either 2 or 1. After executing `same += 1`, `same` is incremented by 1, making it either 3 or 2. Since the exact value of `ar[i-1]` (which is `ar[3]` because `i` is 4) relative to `num` is not specified, `num` remains either `ar[0]` or `ar[i-1]` based on the condition. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
