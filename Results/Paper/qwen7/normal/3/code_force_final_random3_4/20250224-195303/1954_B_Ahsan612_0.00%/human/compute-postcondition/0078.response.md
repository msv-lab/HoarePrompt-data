Output State: **`i` is either 7 or 8, `same` is either 2, 3, or 4, `minn` is 1 if `i` is 7, `num` is `ar[i]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `ar[i]` to the variable `num`. Since `i` is either 7 or 8, `num` will take the value of `ar[7]` or `ar[8]` respectively. The values of `same` and `minn` remain unchanged.
