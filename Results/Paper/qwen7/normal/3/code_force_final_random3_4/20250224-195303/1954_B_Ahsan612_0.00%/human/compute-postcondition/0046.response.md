Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved in the loop head are:
   - `_`: A placeholder variable used in the loop (though it's not named explicitly, it still represents a variable).
   - `int(input())`: This is the number of iterations the loop will run.

2. **Understand the current state**: 
   - `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of the last element in the list `ar`.
   - If `minn` is infinity, then `minn` remains infinity.
   - Otherwise, `minn` is the minimum value found among the counts of consecutive occurrences of any element in the list `ar`.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `i` is equal to `len(ar)`.
   - `num` is the last element of `ar`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments needed**:
   - The loop will execute based on the input provided to `int(input())`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the input provided to `int(input())` must be a positive integer (since `1 \leq t \leq 10^4`).

Given the current state, if the loop is to execute one more time, the input provided to `int(input())` must be a positive integer. However, since the loop head does not directly involve `same`, `minn`, `t`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, or `num`, these variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the input to the loop, which is represented by the variable `_` in the loop head.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of the last element in the list `ar`, if `minn` is infinity, then `minn` remains infinity, otherwise `minn` is the minimum value found among the counts of consecutive occurrences of any element in the list `ar`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, and the input to the loop must be a positive integer.**
