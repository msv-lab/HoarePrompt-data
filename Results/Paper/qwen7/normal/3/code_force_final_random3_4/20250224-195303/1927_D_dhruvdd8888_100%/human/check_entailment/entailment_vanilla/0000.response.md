Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N`, the array itself, and the number of queries `q`.

2. **Processing the Array:**
   - The program constructs an array `arr` where each element of `arr` is a tuple `(start_index, end_index, value)`. This tuple represents the start and end indices of segments in the original array where the value is constant.
   - It uses a loop to iterate through the array and append these tuples to `arr`.

3. **Handling Queries:**
   - For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the relevant segment in `arr` that overlaps with the query range `[l, r]`.
   - Based on the position of the segment found, it determines whether there are two distinct indices within the query range that have different values.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Segment Construction:**
   - The construction of `arr` seems correct. It correctly identifies segments of consecutive identical values in the array.

2. **Query Handling:**
   - The logic for handling queries is mostly correct but has some edge cases that need attention:
     - **Case 1:** If the segment starts after `l`, check if the segment ends before `r`. If so, print the segment boundaries.
     - **Case 2:** If the segment starts before `l` and ends after `r`, check if the segment ends within the range. If so, print the segment boundaries.
     - **Case 3:** If the segment does not overlap with the query range at all, print `-1 -1`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the segment starts exactly at `l` and ends before `r`.
   - However, it might miss some cases where the segment starts before `l` and ends after `r` but does not fully overlap with the query range.

### Example Verification:

Let's verify with a few examples from the provided input:

#### Example 1:
- **Array:** `[1, 1, 2, 1, 1]`
- **Queries:** `[1 5], [1 2], [1 3]`

- **Query 1:** `[1, 5]`
  - Segment: `(1, 2, 1)` and `(3, 5, 1)`
  - Output: `2 3` (correct)

- **Query 2:** `[1, 2]`
  - No segment overlaps completely.
  - Output: `-1 -1` (correct)

- **Query 3:** `[1, 3]`
  - Segment: `(1, 2, 1)`
  - Output: `-1 -1` (incorrect, should be `1 2`)

#### Example 2:
- **Array:** `[30, 20, 20, 10, 10, 20]`
- **Queries:** `[1 2], [2 3], [2 4], [2 6], [3 5]`

- **Query 1:** `[1, 2]`
  - Segment: `(1, 1, 30)` and `(2, 2, 20)`
  - Output: `2 1` (correct)

- **Query 2:** `[2, 3]`
  - Segment: `(2, 2, 20)` and `(3, 3, 20)`
  - Output: `-1 -1` (correct)

- **Query 3:** `[2, 4]`
  - Segment: `(2, 2, 20)` and `(3, 3, 20)` and `(4, 4, 10)`
  - Output: `4 2` (correct)

- **Query 4:** `[2, 6]`
  - Segment: `(2, 2, 20)` and `(3, 3, 20)` and `(4, 4, 10)` and `(5, 5, 10)` and `(6, 6, 20)`
  - Output: `4 6` (correct)

- **Query 5:** `[3, 5]`
  - Segment: `(3, 3, 20)` and `(4, 4, 10)` and `(5, 5, 10)`
  - Output: `5 3` (correct)

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles most cases but fails in some specific scenarios, particularly when the segment starts before `l` and ends after `r` but does not fully overlap with the query range.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
