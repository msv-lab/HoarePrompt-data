### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`), the size of the array (`n`), the array elements (`nums`), and the number of queries (`q`). It then processes each query by finding a pair of indices `(i, j)` such that `a_i â‰  a_j` within the specified range `[l, r]`.

2. **Segmentation Logic**: The program uses a preprocessing step to create segments where consecutive elements are the same. This is done using a loop that iterates through the array and appends segments to `arr`. Each segment is a tuple containing the start index (`s`), end index (`e`), and the value of the segment (`num`). This helps in efficiently finding different elements within any query range.

3. **Query Processing**: For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate segment in `arr` that lies within the query range `[l, r]`. Based on the position of the segment relative to `l` and `r`, it determines whether there are different elements within the range. The logic handles various edge cases, such as when the segment starts before `l` or ends after `r`.

4. **Output Generation**: The program generates the correct output for each query, printing the indices `i` and `j` if they exist, or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists.

Given the detailed analysis, the program appears to handle all aspects of the problem correctly, including input processing, preprocessing, query handling, and output generation.
