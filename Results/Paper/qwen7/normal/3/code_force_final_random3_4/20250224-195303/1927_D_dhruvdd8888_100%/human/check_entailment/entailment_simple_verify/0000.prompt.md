You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

    #
    #This means that after all iterations of the loop, the variable `i` will be equal to `N`, indicating that the loop has completed its execution. The variable `num` will hold the value of `nums[N]` since it gets updated to `nums[i]` on each iteration. The variable `s` will also be equal to `N`, as it gets updated to `i` whenever `nums[i]` is different from `num`. The list `arr` will contain all the necessary segments defined by the conditions inside the loop, starting from the initial segment `(1 + s, 0, num)` up to the final segment `(N + s, N, nums[N])`.

    #State: Output State: All input values have been processed through the loop, meaning the loop has executed a number of times equal to the integer input provided at the start. The final state of the variables `s` and `e` will depend on the last set of inputs (`l` and `r`) and the state of the sorted list `arr`.
    #
    #After all iterations of the loop have finished, the following conditions apply:
    #- `input_value` is the last positive integer input provided.
    #- `l` and `r` are the last integers from the input split by space and converted to int.
    #- `eli` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`.
    #- `s` is the first element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`.
    #- `e` is the second element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`.
    #
    #Based on the logic within the loop:
    #- If `s` equals 1 or `s` is greater than `r`, or if `e >= r`, then `s` and `e` remain unchanged.
    #- Otherwise, `s` and `e` are updated according to the else part of the loop.
    #
    #Thus, the final output state will reflect the result of the last iteration of the loop, with `s` and `e` being either unchanged or updated based on the conditions specified in the else part of the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are no two different elements within the queried range. Specifically, if all elements in the queried range are the same, the program will incorrectly print a valid pair of indices instead of `-1 -1`.

Consider the following example:

- Input:
```
5
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```

- Expected Output:
```
2 3
-1 -1
-1 -1
```

However, the program's output will be:
```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3
```

This happens because the program always tries to find a pair of different elements and prints the first valid pair it finds, even if it is not the correct answer for the given query. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
