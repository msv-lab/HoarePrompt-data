Output State: **`i` is 3, `N` is a valid positive integer, `num` is equal to `nums[3]`, `s` is 2, and `arr` contains the tuple `(3, 3, nums[3])`.**

Explanation: The code appends a tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` to the list `arr`. Given that `s` is 2 and `i` is 3, the tuple becomes `(3, 3, num)`. Since `num` is equal to `nums[3]`, the tuple added to `arr` is `(3, 3, nums[3])`. The values of `i`, `N`, `num`, and `s` remain unchanged.
