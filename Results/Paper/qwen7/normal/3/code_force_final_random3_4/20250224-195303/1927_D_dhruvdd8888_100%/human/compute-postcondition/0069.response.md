Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `input_value` is a positive integer.
   - `l` is the first integer from the input split by space and converted to int.
   - `r` is the second integer from the input split by space and converted to int.
   - `eli` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`.
   - `s` is the first element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`.
   - `e` is the second element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`.
   - `arr` is a sorted list.
   - After the relevant operations, `s` is now the first element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`, and `e` is now the second element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(s - 1, s)
   ```

Given the initial state, we need to determine the values of `s` and `s - 1` that will be printed.

- Since `s` is the first element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`, it represents a specific value from the sorted list `arr`.
- The expression `s - 1` will simply subtract 1 from the value of `s`.

However, without the exact value of `s` from the initial state, we can only describe the output in terms of `s`.

Output: **s - 1, s**
