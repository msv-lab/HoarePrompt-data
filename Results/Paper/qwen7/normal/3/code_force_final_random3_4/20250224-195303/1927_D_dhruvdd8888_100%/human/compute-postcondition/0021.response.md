Output State: **`i` is 2, `N` is a valid positive integer, `num` is equal to `nums[i]`, and `s` is 2**.

Explanation: The code `num = nums[i]` assigns the value of `nums[i]` to the variable `num`. Since `i` is 2, `num` now holds the value of `nums[2]`. The conditions provided in the if part do not change because they are only applied when `nums[i]` equals `num`, which is now true. The values of `N` and `s` remain unchanged.
