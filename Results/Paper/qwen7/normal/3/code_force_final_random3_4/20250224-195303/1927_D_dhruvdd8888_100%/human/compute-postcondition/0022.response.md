Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `N`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i` to `N`, inclusive. Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i < N`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `N` is a valid positive integer (though its exact value is not specified)
   - `num` is equal to `nums[i]` (which means `num` is equal to `nums[2]`)
   - `s` is 2

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be less than `N`.

Given these points, let's update the state:

- `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become `2 + 1 = 3`.
- `N` remains unchanged as it is a constant for the entire loop.
- `num` will now be `nums[3]` because `i` has incremented.
- `s` remains 2 as it is not affected by the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is 3, `N` is a valid positive integer, `num` is equal to `nums[3]`, and `s` is 2**
