Based on the initial state provided:

- `input_value` is a positive integer.
- `l` is the first integer from the input split by space and converted to an integer.
- `r` is the second integer from the input split by space and converted to an integer.
- `eli` is the index of the leftmost insertion point of the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` in the sorted list `arr`.
- `s` is the first element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`.
- `e` is the second element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`.
- `s` is less than or equal to `r`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(s - 1, s)
```

Given that `s` is the first element of the tuple at the minimum index between `eli` and `LA`, and it is guaranteed that `s` is less than or equal to `r`, the expression `s - 1` will yield an integer that is one less than `s`.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `s - 1` followed by the value of `s`.

Output: **s - 1, s**
