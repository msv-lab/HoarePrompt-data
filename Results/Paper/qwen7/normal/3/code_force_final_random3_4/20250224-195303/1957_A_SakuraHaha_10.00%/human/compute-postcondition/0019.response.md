Output State: `ans` is the sum of the floor division of each value in `cnt.values()` by 4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` contains the counts of each unique element from the original list `a`, where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of how many times it appeared in `a`.

In this final state, after all iterations of the loop, `a` is empty as one element is processed in each iteration. The dictionary `cnt` reflects the counts of each unique element from the original list `a`, showing how many times each number appeared in the list. The variable `ans` accumulates the result of dividing each count in `cnt` by 4 and summing these results.
