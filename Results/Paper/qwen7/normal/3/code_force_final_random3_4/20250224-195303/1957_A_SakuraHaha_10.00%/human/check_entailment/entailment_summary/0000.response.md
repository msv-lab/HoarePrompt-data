Reasoning:
1. The program is designed to handle multiple test cases, which aligns with the problem statement.
2. For each test case, it correctly reads the number of sticks (`n`) and their lengths.
3. It uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of each stick length.
4. It calculates the maximum number of regular polygons by dividing the count of each stick length by 4 (since each polygon requires 4 sides).
5. The program outputs the correct results for the provided examples.

Given this analysis, the program appears to follow the problem description accurately and produces the expected output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
