Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, followed by an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of sticks, and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks. It then counts the occurrences of each stick length, calculates the sum of the floor division of these counts by 4, and prints the result. After processing all test cases, the function returns nothing.**
