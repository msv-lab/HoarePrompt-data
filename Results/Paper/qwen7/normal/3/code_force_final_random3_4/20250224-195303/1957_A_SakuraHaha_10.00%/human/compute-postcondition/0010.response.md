Output State: **`ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a non-empty list of integers (without its first element), `cnt` is a dictionary updated based on the new value of `x`, `x` is the next element in the list `a`, `cnt[x]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code updates the dictionary `cnt` by incrementing the count of the key `x` by 1. The value of `x` is the next element in the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
