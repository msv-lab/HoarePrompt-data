Output State: **`ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer; `cnt` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes a dictionary named `cnt`. This does not affect the values of `ans`, `t`, `n`, or `a`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The new variable `cnt` is initialized as an empty dictionary.
