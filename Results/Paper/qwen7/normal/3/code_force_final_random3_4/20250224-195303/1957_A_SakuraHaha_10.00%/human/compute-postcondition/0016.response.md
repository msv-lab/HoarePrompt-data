Output State: **`ans` is 0 + `x` // 4 + `x` // 4, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` must have at least one value**

Explanation: The line `ans += x // 4` increments `ans` by the value of `x // 4`. Since `ans` was initially `0 + x // 4`, after executing this line, `ans` becomes `0 + x // 4 + x // 4`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `cnt` remain unchanged.
