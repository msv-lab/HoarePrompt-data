Output State: `ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is an empty list, `cnt` is a dictionary containing counts of all unique elements from the original list `a` where each key is an element from `a` and its value is the count of how many times it appeared in `a`.

This final state occurs because after all iterations of the loop, the list `a` will be empty since one element is processed in each iteration. The dictionary `cnt` will contain the counts of each unique element from the original list `a`, reflecting how many times each number appeared in the list.
