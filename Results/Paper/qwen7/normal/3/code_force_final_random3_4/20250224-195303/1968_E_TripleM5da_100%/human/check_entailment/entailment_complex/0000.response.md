Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid.
2. The annotated program suggests a fixed pattern of coordinates to be printed for each test case:
   - For the first two cells, it prints `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`.
   - For the remaining cells, it prints `(i, i)` for \(i\) ranging from 3 to \(n\).

3. Let's analyze the Manhattan distances generated by these coordinates:
   - The distance between `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)` is \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\).
   - The distance between `(1, 1)` and `(i, i)` for \(i \geq 3\) is \(|1-i| + |1-i| = 2(i-1)\).
   - The distance between `(1, 2)` and `(i, i)` for \(i \geq 3\) is \(|1-i| + |2-i| = 2(i-2)\).

4. The unique distances generated are:
   - \(1\) (from `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`).
   - \(2, 4, 6, \ldots, 2(n-2)\) (from `(1, 1)` and `(i, i)` for \(i \geq 3\)).
   - \(0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-3\) (from `(1, 2)` and `(i, i)` for \(i \geq 3\)).

5. Combining these, the set \(\mathcal{H}\) includes all integers from \(0\) to \(n-1\) and all even numbers from \(2\) to \(2(n-2)\). This results in a large set of distinct distances, particularly for larger \(n\).

6. The annotated program correctly follows the logic to generate these coordinates for each test case. However, the explanation provided in the annotation is incorrect. The final value of `i` will be `n + 1` only after the loop has completed, but the condition `n > 5` is not strictly necessary for the loop to execute correctly for all \(n \geq 2\).

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the required logic to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
