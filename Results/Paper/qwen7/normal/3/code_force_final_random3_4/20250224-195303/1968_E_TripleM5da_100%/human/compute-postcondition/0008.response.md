Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is at least 4
- `n` is at least 3

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(3, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for values of `i` starting from 3 up to `n` (inclusive).
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is at least 4, and `n` is at least 3.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Determine the Range**: The loop runs for `i` values from 3 to `n` inclusive.
2. **Current Value of `i`**: Since `i` is at least 4, it means `i` could be 4, 5, ..., up to some value less than or equal to `n`.
3. **Condition for Next Iteration**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n + 1`. Since `i` is currently at least 4, the smallest possible value for `i` is 4. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 4 for the loop to continue.
4. **Adjusting States**: We need to update the state such that `i` is incremented by 1 and `n` remains at least 3 but must now be greater than 4.

### Updated State:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so if `i` was 4, it becomes 5.
- `n` must remain at least 3 but must now be greater than 4.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is at least 5, `n` must be greater than 4**
