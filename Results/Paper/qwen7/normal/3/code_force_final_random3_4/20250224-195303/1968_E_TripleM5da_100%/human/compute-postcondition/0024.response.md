Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The initial state at the end of the previous iteration is given as `i` is `n + 1`, and `n` must be greater than 5.

2. **Loop Head**: The loop head is defined as:
   ```python
   for i in range(0, int(input())):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop**: 
   - The loop runs from `0` to `int(input()) - 1`.
   - The variable `i` starts at `0` and is incremented by `1` in each iteration.
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < int(input())`.

4. **Current Values**:
   - Since `i` is `n + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, this means that `i` has already reached the upper limit of the loop, which is `int(input())`.
   - Therefore, `i` must be equal to `int(input())` at the end of the previous iteration.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `int(input())`.
   - Since `i` is currently `n + 1`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be `n + 1 - 1 = n`.

6. **Adjusting the State**:
   - `i` must be `n` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `n` must still be greater than 5 for the loop to have run through all its iterations.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 5**.
