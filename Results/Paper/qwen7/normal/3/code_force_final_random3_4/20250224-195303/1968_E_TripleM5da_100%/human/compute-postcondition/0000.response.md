Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute as long as the value of `i` is less than `int(input())`. 

3. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
   - For each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\).

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since the loop depends on the value of `int(input())`, we need to ensure that `int(input())` is a valid number within the given constraints.
   - The variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, so the initial value of `i` should be 0.
   - The value of `int(input())` must be within the range of `2 \leq n \leq 10^3` to ensure the loop can execute.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be set to 0.
- `int(input())` should be a valid number within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\).

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be an integer within the range 2 to 10^3**.
