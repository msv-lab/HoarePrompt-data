Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(3, n + 1):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initially 0.
   - `n` is an integer within the range 2 to 1000.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will start if the value of `i` is in the range from 3 to `n + 1`.
   - This means `i` must be at least 3 and `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to start executing.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is initially 0, it cannot be in the range from 3 to `n + 1`. Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to a value within the range [3, n+1].
   - `n` is already within the range 2 to 1000, but it must be at least 3 for the loop to start.

Given these points, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- `i` must be at least 3.
- `n` must be at least 3.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is at least 3, `n` is at least 3**.
