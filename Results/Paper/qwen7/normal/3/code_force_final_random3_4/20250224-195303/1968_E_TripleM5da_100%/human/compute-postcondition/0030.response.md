Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `n`, and `n` must be greater than 5.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop is defined as `for i in range(3, n + 1):`.

3. **Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n + 1`. Since `i` is currently equal to `n`, the loop will increment `i` by 1 to check if it is still within the range.

4. **Next Iteration**: After the loop increments `i` by 1, `i` will become `n + 1`. However, the loop will only continue if `i` is less than `n + 1`. Therefore, `i` will be incremented to `n + 1`, but the loop will stop because `i` will no longer be less than `n + 1`.

5. **Adjusting States**: The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. We need to adjust these variables for the next iteration. Since `i` is incremented by 1, it will become `n + 1`. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n + 1`, which will no longer be true after this iteration.

6. **Final State**: Given that the loop will not execute again, the state remains the same as the end of the previous iteration, where `i` is `n` and `n` must be greater than 5.

However, since the loop will not execute again, we need to reflect the fact that `i` will be incremented to `n + 1` and the loop will terminate.

**State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 5**
