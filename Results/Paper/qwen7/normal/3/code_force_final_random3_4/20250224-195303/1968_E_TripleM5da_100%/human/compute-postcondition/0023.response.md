Output State: `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 5.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the final value of `i` will be `n + 1`. This is because the loop starts with `i` as 3 and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration. If the loop executes until the end, it means `i` has been incremented enough times to reach `n + 1`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 5 for the loop to run through all its iterations.
