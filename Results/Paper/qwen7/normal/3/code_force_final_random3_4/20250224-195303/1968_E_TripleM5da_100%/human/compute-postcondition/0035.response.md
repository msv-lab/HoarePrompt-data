Output State: The value of `i` will be `n + 1` and `n` must be greater than 5.

After the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will increment by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `n + 1`. Since the loop runs from 3 to `n` (inclusive), it will execute `n - 2` times. After these iterations, `i` will be set to `n + 1`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
