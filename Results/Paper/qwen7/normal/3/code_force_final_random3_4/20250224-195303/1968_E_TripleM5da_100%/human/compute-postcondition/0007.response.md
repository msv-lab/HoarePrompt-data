Based on the initial state provided, `i` is at least 4 and `n` is at least 3. This means that both `i` and `n` have values that are greater than or equal to their respective minimums.

The print statement `print(i, i)` will print the value of `i` twice.

Since `i` is at least 4, the exact value of `i` is not specified, but we know it is 4 or greater.

Output: **4 4**
