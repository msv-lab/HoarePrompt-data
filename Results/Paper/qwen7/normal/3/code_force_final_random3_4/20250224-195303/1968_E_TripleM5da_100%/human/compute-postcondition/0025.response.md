Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, and `n` must be greater than 5.**

Explanation: The code replaces the current value of `n` with an integer input from the user. The variable `i` remains unchanged and still holds the value of the original `n`, which must be greater than 5. The new value of `n` is an integer input from the user, but its exact value is not specified without further input.
