Output State: `i` will be `n`, `n` must be greater than 4.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to the final value of `n`, and `n` must be greater than 4. This is because the loop starts from `i = 3` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` is no longer less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, the last value `i` takes on before exiting the loop is `n`, provided `n` is greater than 4.
