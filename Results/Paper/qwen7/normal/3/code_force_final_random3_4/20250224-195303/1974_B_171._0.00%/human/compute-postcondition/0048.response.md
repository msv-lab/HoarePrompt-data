Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `char` from the `encoded` string.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the `encoded` string. Since `encoded` is a non-empty string and becomes one character shorter with each iteration, the loop will continue until `encoded` is empty.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `encoded` is a non-empty string (one character shorter) and its length \( n \) satisfies \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 - 1 \).
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `encoded` must still contain at least one character. Therefore, `encoded` will be a non-empty string but one character shorter than it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - The variable `decoded` will have an additional character appended to it based on the current value of `char`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `encoded` is now a non-empty string (two characters shorter) consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
- `decoded` will have an additional character appended to it based on the current value of `char`.

So, the updated state is:

**`encoded` is now a non-empty string (two characters shorter) consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length \( n \) satisfies \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 - 2 \); `decoded` is a list where each character in the original `encoded` string, except the first two, has been appended to according to the `mapping`. If the character `char` is in `mapping`, the corresponding decoded character is appended to `decoded`. Otherwise, 'z' is added to `decoded` and `mapping` if it does not already exist.**

State: **`encoded` is now a non-empty string (two characters shorter) consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length \( n \) satisfies \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 - 2 \); `decoded` is a list where each character in the original `encoded` string, except the first two, has been appended to according to the `mapping`.**
