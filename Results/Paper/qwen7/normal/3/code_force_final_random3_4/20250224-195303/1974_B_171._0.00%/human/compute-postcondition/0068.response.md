Postcondition: **`encoded` is now a non-empty string (two characters shorter) consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length \( n \) satisfies \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 - 2 \); `decoded` is a list where each character in the original `encoded` string, except the first two, has been appended to according to the `mapping`, and `decoded` now contains one additional element. If the character `char` is in `mapping`, `decoded` contains one additional element as per the mapping. If the character `char` is not in `mapping`, `c` is equal to 122.**
