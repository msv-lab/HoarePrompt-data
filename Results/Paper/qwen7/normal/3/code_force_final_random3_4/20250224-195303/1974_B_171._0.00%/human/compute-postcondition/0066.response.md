Output State: The dictionary `mapping` contains mappings for all lowercase Latin letters from 'a' to 'z', with each letter being mapped to a unique character. The variable `c` will hold the ASCII value of 'z' after the loop completes, as the loop iterates through all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z' and assigns each one to `chr(c)` in the dictionary `mapping`.

In more detail, after all iterations of the loop, the `mapping` dictionary will have keys for every lowercase letter from 'a' to 'z', and each key will map to a unique character. Specifically, `mapping['a']` will map to some character, `mapping['b']` to another, and so on until `mapping['z']`. The variable `c` will have the value of `ord('z')`, which is 122, since the loop will stop after processing 'z'.
