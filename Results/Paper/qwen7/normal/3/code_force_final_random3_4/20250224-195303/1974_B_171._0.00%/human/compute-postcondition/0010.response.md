Output State: **`encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `char` is not in `mapping`, `c` is 97, `mapping['a']` is 'a', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since no variables are modified by the `break` statement, their initial states remain unchanged.
