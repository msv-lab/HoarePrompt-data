Output State: **`c` is the ASCII value of the next character in the sequence from 'a' to 'z', and the character represented by `chr(c)` is now mapped to `char` in the dictionary `mapping`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of `c` or `char` in the dictionary `mapping`. It only indicates that we exit the current loop or conditional block.
