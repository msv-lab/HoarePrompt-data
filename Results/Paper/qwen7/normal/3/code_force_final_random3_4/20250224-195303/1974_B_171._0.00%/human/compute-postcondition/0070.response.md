Output State: **The program returns an empty string since `encoded` is an empty string and there are no characters to map.**

Given the initial state where `encoded` is an empty string, there are no characters to process and map according to the `mapping`. Therefore, the `decoded` list remains empty. The code then joins the `decoded` list into a string and returns it, which results in an empty string.
