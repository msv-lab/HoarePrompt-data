Postcondition: `encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `decoded` is a list where each character in `encoded` is replaced according to the `mapping`, unless a character is not found in `mapping`, in which case it is mapped to the corresponding character from 'a' to 'z' and added to `decoded`.
