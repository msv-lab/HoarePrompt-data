Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for char in encoded:`. The objects involved here are `char`, `encoded`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length \( n \) satisfies \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \).
   - `mapping` is an empty dictionary (not relevant for the loop execution).
   - `decoded` is an empty list (not relevant for the loop execution).

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each character in the `encoded` string. For the loop to execute, `encoded` must contain at least one character.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `encoded` must contain at least one character for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `encoded` is not empty.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

State: **`encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5**.
