Output State: **`encoded` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `char` is in the `mapping`; `decoded` now contains one more element which is the mapping of `char`.**

Explanation: The code appends the mapped value of `char` from the `mapping` dictionary to the `decoded` list. Since `char` is guaranteed to be in the `mapping`, the `decoded` list will have one additional element corresponding to the mapped value of `char`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
