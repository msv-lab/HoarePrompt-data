Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.**

The `pass` statement in Python does nothing and simply indicates that the block is intentionally empty. Therefore, no variables are assigned new values or undergo any changes. The initial state remains unchanged.
