Postcondition: `c` is increased by 1, `k` is increased by 1, `ans` is updated based on the character at index `k` in string `s`, `res[c]` is updated based on the new value of `ans` and `m`, `l` is updated if the character at index `k` in string `s` is 'L', and `r` is updated if the character at index `k` in string `s` is not 'L'. 

- If the character at index `k` in string `s` is 'L', then `l` is incremented by 1, and `res[c]` is set to `ans // res[c] % MOD`.
- If the character at index `k` in string `s` is not 'L', then `r` is decremented by 1, and `res[c]` is set to `ans % m % MOD`.
