Output State: **`k` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is 1, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `l` is increased by 1 if the character at index 1 of `s` is 'L', `c` is 2**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by performing integer division by `arr[r]` and then taking modulo `MOD`. However, since `ans` is initially undefined (`ans` is undefined in the initial state), we cannot determine its exact value without knowing `arr[r]`. Given that `ans` is initially undefined, we assume it starts as 1 (a common default value for such operations). After the operation, `ans` becomes `1 // arr[r] % MOD`. Since `arr[r]` is not specified, we keep it as `arr[r]`. The other variables remain unchanged as no operation affects them.
