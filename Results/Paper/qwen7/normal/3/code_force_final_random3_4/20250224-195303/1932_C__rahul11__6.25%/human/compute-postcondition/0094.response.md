Output State: **`ans` is `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `c` is `c + 1`, `k` is `k + 1` and `k` is less than `n - 1`**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` by performing integer division by `arr[l]` and then taking the modulus with `MOD`. The values of `c` and `k` are incremented by 1 each. The condition that `k` must be less than `n - 1` remains valid.
