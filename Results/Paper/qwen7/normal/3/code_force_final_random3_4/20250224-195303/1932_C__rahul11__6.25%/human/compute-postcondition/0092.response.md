Output State: **`c` is increased by 1, `k` is increased by 1, `ans` is updated based on the character at index `k` in string `s`, `res[c]` is updated based on the new value of `ans` and `m`, `l` is updated if the character at index `k` in string `s` is 'L', and `r` is updated if the character at index `k` in string `s` is not 'L'. `c` is `c + 1`.**

This means that the variable `c` has been incremented by 1. The values of `k`, `ans`, `res`, `m`, `l`, and `r` remain as they were before, except that their states are now contingent upon the character at index `k` in the string `s`. Specifically, if the character at index `k` in `s` is 'L', then `l` will be incremented by 1, and `res[c]` will be set to `ans // res[c] % MOD`. If the character is not 'L', then `r` will be decremented by 1, and `res[c]` will be set to `ans % m % MOD`.
