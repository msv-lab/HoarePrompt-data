Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for k in range(n - 1)`. The variables involved here are `k`, `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `k` is initialized to 0 (since `range(n - 1)` generates values from 0 to `n-2`).
   - `n` is a variable that determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `k < n - 1`. Therefore, the loop will run until `k` reaches `n - 2`.

4. **Adjust the states based on the loop head**:
   - `k` should be set to 0 initially.
   - `n` should be such that the loop runs at least once, meaning `n` must be at least 2 (since `range(n - 1)` requires `n - 1` to be at least 1).

5. **Other variables**:
   - `arr`, `i`, `ans`, `res[0]`, `c`, `l`, and `r` are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `k` and `n`.

Therefore, the final state is:
**`k` is 0, `n` must be at least 2**.

So, the answer is:
State: **`k` is 0, `n` must be at least 2**
