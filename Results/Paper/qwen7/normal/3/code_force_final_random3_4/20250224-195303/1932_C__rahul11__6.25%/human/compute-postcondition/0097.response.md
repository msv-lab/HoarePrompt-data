Output State: **`ans` is the result of `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `c` is `c + 1`, `k` is `k + 1` and k is less than `n - 1**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `ans` by performing integer division by `arr[r]` and then taking the modulo with `MOD`. The values of `c` and `k` are each incremented by 1. The condition that `k` must be less than `n - 1` remains valid after the code execution.
