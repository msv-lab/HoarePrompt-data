Output State: **`k` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `ans` is 0, `res[3]` is either 0 or `1 % m % MOD`, `l` is 2 if the character at index 1 of `s` is 'L', otherwise `l` is 3, `c` is 3, `r` is `r - 1`**

The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
