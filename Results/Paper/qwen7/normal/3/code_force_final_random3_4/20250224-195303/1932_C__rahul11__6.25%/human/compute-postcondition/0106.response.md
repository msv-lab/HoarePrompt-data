Output State: **`c` is 3, `k` is `n` - 2, `ans` is the result of repeatedly dividing `ans` by either `arr[l]` or `arr[r]` based on the characters in `s` up to index `n` - 2, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `l` is the leftmost index that hasn't been divided out yet, and `r` is the rightmost index that hasn't been divided out yet; `n` and `m` are assigned the values from the input split into integers.**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and splits them using whitespace as the delimiter. These integers are then assigned to `n` and `m`. The values of the other variables (`c`, `k`, `ans`, `res[c]`, `l`, and `r`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
