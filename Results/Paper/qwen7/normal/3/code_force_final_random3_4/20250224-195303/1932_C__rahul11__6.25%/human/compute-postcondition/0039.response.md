Postcondition: `c` and `k` are both increased by 1. If `s[k]` is equal to 'L', then `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `c` is increased by 1, `k` is increased by 1, `res[c]` is set to `ans % m % MOD`, and `l` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `c` is increased by 1, `k` is increased by 1, `res[c]` is set to `ans % m % MOD`, and `r` is decreased by 1.
