Output State: **`ans` is the result of `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `c` is increased by 1, `k` is increased by 1, `res[c]` is equal to `ans % m % MOD`, `r` is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. All other variables (`ans`, `c`, `k`, and `res[c]`) remain unchanged from their previous values. Therefore, the updated state includes the decrement of `r` by 1.
