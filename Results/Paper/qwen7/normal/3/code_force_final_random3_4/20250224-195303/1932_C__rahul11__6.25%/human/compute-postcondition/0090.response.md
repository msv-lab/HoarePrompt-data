Postcondition: `c` is increased by 1, `k` is increased by 1, `ans` is updated based on the character at index `k` in string `s`, `res[c]` is updated based on the new value of `ans` and `m`, `l` is updated by 1 if the character at index `k` in string `s` is 'L', and `r` is updated if the character at index `k` in string `s` is not 'L'. Specifically, if the character at index `k` in string `s` is 'L', `ans` is updated to `ans // res[c] % MOD` and `res[c]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`, and `l` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `res[c]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD` and `r` is decremented by 1.
