Output State: **`res` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, `c` is 3, `k` is `n` - 2, `l` is the leftmost index that hasn't been divided out yet, `r` is the rightmost index that hasn't been divided out yet, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the input split into integers, `s` is a list of characters obtained from the input, `ans` is the result of repeatedly dividing `ans` by either `arr[l]` or `arr[r]` based on the characters in `s` up to index `n` - 2, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`.**

Explanation: The line `res = [0] * n` initializes a list `res` of length `n` with all elements set to 0. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables mentioned in the initial state.
