Output State: **`ans` is `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `c` is `c + 1`, `k` is `k + 1` and `k` is less than `n - 1`; `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `l` is `l + 1`.**

Explanation: The line `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. All other variables (`ans`, `c`, `k`, `res`, and `MOD`, `m`) remain unchanged from their previous states. The condition that `k` is less than `n - 1` also remains valid.
