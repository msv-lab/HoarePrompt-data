Output State: **`cnt` is increased by 1 if `b[j_prev]` is less than `a[i]`, otherwise `i` is increased by 1 if `b[j_prev]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`, `j` is `j_prev + 1`, `i` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` simply increments the value of `i` by 1. It does not affect the conditions under which `cnt` is increased or the value of `j`. Therefore, the updated state includes that `i` has been incremented by 1, while the conditions for `cnt` and `j` remain unchanged.
