State: **`cnt` is either 0, 1, or any value up to `n-1`, `t` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n-1`**.

Explanation:
- The loop variable `_` is used in the `for` loop, but it does not affect the states of other variables.
- The loop itself does not change the values of `cnt`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `i`, or `j`.
- Since the loop runs `t` times, and the current state indicates that the loop has already completed its iterations (as `i` is `n` and `j` is `n-1`), the loop cannot execute again unless `t` is incremented.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `t` to indicate that the loop can execute one more time. Given that `t` is a positive integer, the new state should reflect that `t` can now be incremented to allow the loop to run one more time.

State: **`cnt` is either 0, 1, or any value up to `n-1`, `t` is a positive integer that can be incremented, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n-1`**.
