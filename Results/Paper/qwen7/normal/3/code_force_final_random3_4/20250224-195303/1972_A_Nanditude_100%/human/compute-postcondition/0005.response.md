Output State: **`cnt` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The line `cnt = 0` initializes the variable `cnt` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
