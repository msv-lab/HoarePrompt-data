Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `j` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cnt` is either 0 or 1.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `b` is a list of integers.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is 0.

4. **Loop body behavior**:
   - The loop increments `j` by 1 in each iteration.
   - If `b[j]` (which is `b[0]` since `j` starts at 0) is less than `a[i]` (which is `a[0]`), then `cnt` is set to 1. Otherwise, `cnt` remains 0.

5. **Determine the new state**:
   - Since `j` is currently 0, the loop will execute if `j < n` is true.
   - After the first iteration, `j` will be incremented to 1.
   - Therefore, the new value of `j` will be 1.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `cnt` remains either 0 or 1 based on the condition in the loop body.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
   - `i` remains 1.
   - `j` changes from 0 to 1.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`cnt` is either 0 or 1, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 1**
