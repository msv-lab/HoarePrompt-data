Output State: **`cnt` is either 0, 1, or any value up to `n-1`, `t` is a positive integer that can be incremented, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `i` is `n`, `j` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (which is an integer) to the variable `n`. The other variables (`cnt`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
