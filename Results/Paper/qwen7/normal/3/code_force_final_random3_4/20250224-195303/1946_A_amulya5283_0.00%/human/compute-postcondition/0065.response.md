Output State: **`arr` is sorted in ascending order; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[n // 2] - 1`; `heap` is a heap data structure starting from `arr[n // 2 + 1]` to the end of `arr` with the smallest element incremented by 1 and the smallest element is now the previous smallest element plus 1; `operations` is 3; `smallest` is the smallest element from the heap before it was popped and incremented by 1; `heap[0]` is now the smallest element from the heap before it was popped and incremented by 2; `heap` includes the new element `smallest + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)` pushes the value of `smallest + 1` into the heap. Since `smallest` is the smallest element from the heap before it was popped and incremented by 1, the new element pushed into the heap is `smallest + 1`, which is the previous smallest element plus 2. The heap property ensures that the smallest element in the heap is maintained.
