Output State: **`operations` is 7; `heap` has its smallest element, which is now 3 more than the original median, replaced with `smallest + 1`; `smallest` is the new value after removing the smallest element from the heap, which is now the fourth smallest element in the original array; `heap[0]` is now `smallest + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `results.append(operations)` increments the value of `operations` by 1. Since `operations` was initially 6, it is now 7. All other variables (`heap`, `smallest`, and `heap[0]`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
