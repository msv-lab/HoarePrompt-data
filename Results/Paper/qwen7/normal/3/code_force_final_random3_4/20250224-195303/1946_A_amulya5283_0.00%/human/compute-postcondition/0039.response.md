Output State: **`operations` is 4; `smallest` is the smallest element in `heap` after removing the smallest element; `heap[0]` is now `smallest + 1` and the new smallest element is the new root of the heap.**

Explanation: The code `operations += 1` increments the value of `operations` by 1. Since `operations` was initially 3, after executing this line, `operations` becomes 4. The other variables (`arr`, `median_index`, `current_median`, `heap`, `smallest`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
