Output State: `results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `i` is 0, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is `arr[median_index:]` with `heap` transformed into a min-heap without the smallest element, `operations` is 6, `smallest` is the smallest element popped from `heap`, `smallest + 1` is pushed onto `heap`, and `heap[0]` is now the final smallest element in the heap after all iterations.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `operations` counter will have incremented to 6 (since it increments by 1 each time the loop runs). The `heap` will no longer contain the original smallest element, as it has been replaced by `smallest + 1` during each iteration. The `heap[0]` will be the final smallest element remaining in the heap after all elements have been processed according to the conditions of the loop.
