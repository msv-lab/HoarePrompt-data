Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `i` is 0, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is `arr[median_index:]` with `heap` transformed into a min-heap without the smallest element, `operations` is 3, `smallest` is the smallest element popped from `heap`, `smallest + 1` is pushed onto `heap`, and `heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median`. After executing `heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)`, the smallest element in `heap` has been incremented by 1 and added back to the heap.**

In more detail, the heap has had its smallest element (which was `smallest`) removed and replaced with `smallest + 1`. Therefore, the heap now contains all elements except the smallest one, which is now `smallest + 1`.
