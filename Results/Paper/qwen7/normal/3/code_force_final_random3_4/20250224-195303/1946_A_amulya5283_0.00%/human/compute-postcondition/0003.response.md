Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `i` is 0, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`.**

Explanation: The code `arr.sort()` sorts the list `arr`, which is the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`. The sorting operation modifies `arr` in place, changing its order but not its content. The other variables remain unchanged.
