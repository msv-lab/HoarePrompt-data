Output State: **`test_cases` is used to assign its i-th element to `n` and `arr`; `arr` is sorted.**

Explanation: The code `arr.sort()` sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The initial state of `test_cases` remains unchanged, and the sorting operation only affects `arr`. Therefore, `test_cases` is still used to assign its i-th element to `n` and `arr`, while `arr` is now sorted.
