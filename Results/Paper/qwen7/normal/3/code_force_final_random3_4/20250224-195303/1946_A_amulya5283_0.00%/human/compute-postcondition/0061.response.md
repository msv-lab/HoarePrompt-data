Output State: **`arr` is sorted in ascending order; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[n // 2] - 1`; `heap` is a heap data structure starting from `arr[n // 2 + 1]` to the end of `arr` with the smallest element incremented by 1 and the smallest element is now the previous smallest element plus 1; `operations` is 3; `smallest` is the smallest element from the heap before it was popped and incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code pushes the smallest element from the heap (which is `smallest`) incremented by 1 into the heap using `heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)`. This increases the value of `smallest` by 1, and the operations count is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
