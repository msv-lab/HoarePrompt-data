Output State: `arr` is sorted in ascending order; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[n // 2] - 3`; `heap` is a heap data structure starting from `arr[n // 2 + 3]` to the end of `arr` with each element incremented by 3; `operations` is 6; `smallest` is the smallest element from the heap before it was popped and incremented by 3.

Explanation: After each iteration of the loop, the smallest element in the heap is popped, incremented by 1, and then pushed back into the heap. This process is repeated until the smallest element in the heap is greater than the current median. Since the loop executes 3 more times after the given states, the smallest element in the heap will be incremented by 3. The `current_median` will be `arr[n // 2] - 3`, and the `operations` counter will be incremented by 3 more times, making it a total of 6 operations. The `heap` will start from `arr[n // 2 + 3]` to the end of `arr`, with each element incremented by 3.
