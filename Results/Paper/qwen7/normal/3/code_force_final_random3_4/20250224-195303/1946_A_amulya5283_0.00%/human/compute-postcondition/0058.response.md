Output State: **`arr` is sorted in ascending order; `median_index` is `n // 2`; `current_median` is `arr[n // 2] - 1`; `heap` is a heap data structure starting from `arr[n // 2 + 1]` to the end of `arr` with the smallest element incremented by 1; `operations` is 3**.

Explanation: The variable `operations` was incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables (`arr`, `median_index`, `current_median`, and `heap`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
