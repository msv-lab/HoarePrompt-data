Output State: **`t` remains an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers assigned by `map(int, input().split())`.**

The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `a`, `b`, and `m`. The value of `t` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
