Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` is incorrect because it does not account for the overlapping visibility periods of fireworks launched at different intervals.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`, which represents the interval at which both installations launch fireworks simultaneously. We then need to calculate how many fireworks can be visible within one LCM period and adjust for any additional fireworks that might overlap at the beginning or end of the period.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = lcm(a, b)
        max_visible = 0
        # Calculate the number of fireworks visible at the start of each lcm_ab period
        for j in range(lcm_ab):
            count_a = j // a + 1
            count_b = j // b + 1
            count_both = j // lcm_ab + 1
            max_visible = max(max_visible, count_a + count_b - count_both)
        # Add the remaining fireworks that might be visible at the end of the period
        remaining_time = m % lcm_ab
        count_a = remaining_time // a + 1
        count_b = remaining_time // b + 1
        count_both = remaining_time // lcm_ab + 1
        max_visible = max(max_visible, count_a + count_b - count_both)
        print(max_visible)

func()
```

This corrected function calculates the LCM of `a` and `b` and then iterates through each period to determine the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time, taking into account overlaps and the end of the period.
