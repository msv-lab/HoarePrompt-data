Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(t):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `i` is currently 1.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < t`.
   - Since `i` starts at 1, the loop will execute if `i` is less than `t`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 2.
   - The value of `t` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.

5. **Formulate the New State:**
   - `t` remains an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `i` becomes 2.
   - `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 2, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**
