Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

The code creates a list `l` by splitting the input string using `split()` and then converting each element to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. The values of `t`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
