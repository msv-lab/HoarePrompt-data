Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `e` is a set containing unique elements from `l`, `m` is the length of `l`. If 1 is in `l`, no changes are made to the variables. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
