Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` will be equal to `t`, `n` will be the last input integer read from the user, `l` will be the list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer for the last iteration, `e` will be the set containing unique elements from the list `l` for the last iteration, and `m` will be the length of the list `l` for the last iteration. If the list `l` for the last iteration contains the integer 1, then "Bob" will be printed. Otherwise, "Alice" will be printed for the last iteration.
