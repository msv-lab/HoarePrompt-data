Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is the length of the list `S`, `left` is `S[2][0]`, `lsum` is `S[2][0] + S[2][1]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[2][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[2][0] + S[2][1])`, `lsum` is `S[2][0] + S[2][1]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `lsum` to `S[i][0] + S[i][1]`. Given that `i` is 2, `lsum` is now `S[2][0] + S[2][1]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously calculated states.
