Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the length of the list `S`, `left` is `S[0][0]`, `lsum` is `S[0][0] + S[0][1]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[0][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[0][0] + S[0][1])`, and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables and the loop continues, the values of `i`, `n`, `left`, `lsum`, `right`, and `rsum` remain unchanged. The condition `(left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum)` remains true, and the loop will continue based on this condition.
