Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` is the length of the list `S`
   - `left` is `S[0][0]`
   - `lsum` is `S[0][0] + S[0][1]`
   - `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[0][1]`
   - `rsum` is `n - (S[0][0] + S[0][1])`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.
   - The condition inside the loop is checked after each iteration.

3. **Condition Inside the Loop:**
   - If `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum` holds, `i` remains 0.
   - Otherwise, the condition `(left * 2 >= lsum) and (right * 2 >= rsum)` holds true.
   - If the above condition is met, and if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`, then `ans` remains equal to `i`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is currently 0, the loop will increment `i` to 1.
   - We need to check the conditions for `i = 1`.

5. **Adjusting States for Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - `n` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `left` becomes `S[1][0]`.
   - `lsum` becomes `S[1][0] + S[1][1]`.
   - `right` remains `S[-1][1] - S[0][1]` because it does not depend on `i`.
   - `rsum` remains `n - (S[0][0] + S[0][1])` because it does not depend on `i`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is the length of the list `S`, `left` is `S[1][0]`, `lsum` is `S[1][0] + S[1][1]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[0][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[0][0] + S[0][1])`**
