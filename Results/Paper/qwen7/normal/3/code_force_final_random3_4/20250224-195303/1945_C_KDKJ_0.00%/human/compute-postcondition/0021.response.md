Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop is iterating over each character in the string `a`. The only variable in the loop head is `s`, which represents the current character being iterated over.

2. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `a` is a non-empty string consisting only of '0' and '1'.
   - `S` is a list containing a sublist `[x+1, y]` or `[x, y+1]` depending on the last character of `a`.

3. **Understand the Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each character in `a`.
   - After the loop completes one iteration, `s` will be the current character being processed.
   - The value of `S` will depend on the last character of `a`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `s` is the current character being processed, it will change in the next iteration.
   - The list `S` will be updated based on the current character `s`.

5. **Determine the New State**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `s` was the last character of `a`.
   - For the next iteration, `s` will be the next character in `a`.
   - The list `S` will be updated based on the new character `s`.

Given that `a` is a non-empty string consisting only of '0' and '1', and `S` is updated based on the last character of `a`, we need to consider the next character in `a`.

Since `a` is non-empty and consists only of '0' and '1', the next character `s` could be either '0' or '1'. However, without knowing the exact content of `a`, we can generalize the state as follows:

- `a` remains a non-empty string consisting only of '0' and '1'.
- `S` will be updated based on the new character `s`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**State: **`a` is a non-empty string consisting only of '0' and '1'; `S` is a list containing a sublist [x+1, y] or [x, y+1] depending on the next character of `a`**.
