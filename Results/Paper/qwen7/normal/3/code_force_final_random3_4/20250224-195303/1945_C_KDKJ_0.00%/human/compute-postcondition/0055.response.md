Output State: **`ans` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is the length of the list `S`, `left` is `S[i][0]`, `lsum` is `S[i][0] + S[i][1]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[i][0] + S[i][1])`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 1) to the variable `ans`. All other variables (`i`, `n`, `left`, `lsum`, `right`, `rsum`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
