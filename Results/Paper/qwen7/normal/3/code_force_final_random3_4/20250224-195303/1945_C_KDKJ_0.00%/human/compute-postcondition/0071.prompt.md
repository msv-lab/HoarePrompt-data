Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is 0, `S` is a list containing sublists `[x, y]` for each character in the string `a`, where `x` is the count of '0's encountered so far and `y` is the count of '1's encountered so far, and `satisfy` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    left = S[i][0]
    lsum = S[i][0] + S[i][1]
    right = S[-1][1] - S[i][1]
    rsum = n - lsum
    if left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum:
        continue
    elif abs(n / 2 - i) <= abs(n / 2 - ans):
        ans = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `i` is 0, `n` is the length of the list `S`, `left` is `S[0][0]`, `lsum` is `S[0][0] + S[0][1]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[0][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[0][0] + S[0][1])`. If the condition `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum` holds, `i` remains 0. Otherwise, the condition `(left * 2 >= lsum) and (right * 2 >= rsum)` holds true, and if the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`, then `ans` remains equal to `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `n` is the length of the list `S`, `left` is `S[i][0]`, `lsum` is `S[i][0] + S[i][1]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[i][0] + S[i][1])`. If the condition `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum` is met, we continue to the next iteration. Otherwise, `ans` is updated based on whether the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is smaller than or equal to the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `i` is 2, `n` is the length of the list `S`, `left` is `S[2][0]`, `lsum` is `S[2][0] + S[2][1]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[2][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[2][0] + S[2][1])`. If either `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum` is true, then `i` remains 2. Otherwise, `i` remains 2 as well.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
