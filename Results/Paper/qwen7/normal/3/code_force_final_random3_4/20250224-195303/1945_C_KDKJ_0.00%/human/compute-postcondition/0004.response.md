Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for _ in range(int(input())):` statement.
2. **Determine the variables involved in the loop head**: The loop head involves the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used to iterate over the range.
   - `int(input())`: This is the upper limit of the range, determined by user input.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**: `func_1()` has been called again.

4. **Adjusting the state for the next iteration**:
   - The loop will execute again if the condition `int(input()) > 0` is satisfied (since `range(x)` generates numbers from 0 to x-1).
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `int(input())` to ensure it is greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`func_1()` has been called again, int(input()) must be greater than 0**
