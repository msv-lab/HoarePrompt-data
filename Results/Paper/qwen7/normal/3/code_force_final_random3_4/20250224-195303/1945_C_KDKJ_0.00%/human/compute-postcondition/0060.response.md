Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is the length of the list `S`
   - `left` is `S[i][0]`
   - `lsum` is `S[i][0] + S[i][1]`
   - `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`
   - `rsum` is `n - (S[i][0] + S[i][1])`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum`.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be 2 in the next iteration.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `n` remains the same as it is the length of the list `S`, which does not change within the loop.
   - `left` is now `S[2][0]`.
   - `lsum` is now `S[2][0] + S[2][1]`.
   - `right` is now `S[-1][1] - S[2][1]`.
   - `rsum` is now `n - (S[2][0] + S[2][1])`.

5. **Final State for the Next Iteration:**
   - We need to ensure that the conditions `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum` are checked with the new values of `left`, `lsum`, `right`, and `rsum`.

**State:**
- `i` is 2
- `n` is the length of the list `S`
- `left` is `S[2][0]`
- `lsum` is `S[2][0] + S[2][1]`
- `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[2][1]`
- `rsum` is `n - (S[2][0] + S[2][1])`

So, the final state for the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` is the length of the list `S`, `left` is `S[2][0]`, `lsum` is `S[2][0] + S[2][1]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[2][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[2][0] + S[2][1])**.
