Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is the length of the list `S`, `left` is `S[2][0]`, `lsum` is `S[2][0] + S[2][1]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[2][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[2][0] + S[2][1])`, `left` is updated to `S[2][0]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `left` to be equal to `S[2][0]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
