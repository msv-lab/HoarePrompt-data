Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` is the length of the list `S`; `left` is `S[0][0]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the first element of the first sublist in the list `S` to the variable `left`. Since `i` is initially 0, `S[i][0]` refers to the first element of the first sublist in `S`. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
