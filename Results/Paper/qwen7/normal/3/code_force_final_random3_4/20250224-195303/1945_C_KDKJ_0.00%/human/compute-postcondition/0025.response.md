Postcondition: `a` is a non-empty string consisting only of '0' and '1'; `x` is the last element of the sublist in `S[-1]` plus 1 if `s` is '0', otherwise `x` remains the same as the last element of the sublist in `S[-1]`; `y` is the second last element of the sublist in `S[-1]` plus 1 if `s` is not '0', otherwise `y` remains the same as the second last element of the sublist in `S[-1]`.
