Postcondition: `i` is 1, `n` is the length of the list `S`, `left` is `S[i][0]`, `lsum` is `S[i][0] + S[i][1]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[i][0] + S[i][1])`. If the condition `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum` is true, we continue to the next iteration. Otherwise, `ans` is updated based on whether the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `ans`.
