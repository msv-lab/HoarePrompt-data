Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is the length of the list `S`, `left` is `S[2][0]`, `lsum` is `S[2][0] + S[2][1]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[2][0] + S[2][1])`, `lsum` is `S[2][0] + S[2][1]`**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `right` to `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`. Given that `i` is 2, `right` is now updated to `S[-1][1] - S[2][1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
