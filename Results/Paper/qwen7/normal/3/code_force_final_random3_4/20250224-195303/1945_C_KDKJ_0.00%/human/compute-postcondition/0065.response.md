The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. However, since no loop was specified in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is the length of the list `S`, `left` is `S[2][0]`, `lsum` is `S[2][0] + S[2][1]`, `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]`, `rsum` is `n - (S[2][0] + S[2][1])**
