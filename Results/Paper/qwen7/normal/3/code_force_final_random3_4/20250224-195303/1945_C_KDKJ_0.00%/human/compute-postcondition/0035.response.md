Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` is the length of the list `S`; `left` is `S[0][0]`; `lsum` is `S[0][0] + S[0][1]`; `right` is `S[-1][1] - S[0][1]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `S[-1][1] - S[i][1]` to the variable `right`. Given that `i` is 0, `right` becomes `S[-1][1] - S[0][1]`. The values of `i`, `n`, `left`, and `lsum` remain unchanged from their initial states.
