Output State: **`T` is a type variable, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `v` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9, and `p` is a permutation of numbers from 1 to n. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.**

Explanation: The code snippet defines a type variable `T` using `TypeVar('T')`. This does not affect the values of the existing variables (`t`, `n`, `v`, and `p`). Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions provided.
