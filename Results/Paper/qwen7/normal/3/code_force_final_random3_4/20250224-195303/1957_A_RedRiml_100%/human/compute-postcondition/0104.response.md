Postcondition: **`shapes` is either 0 + (d[j] // 3) or 0, `d` is a dictionary where the count of each element in `palka` is stored, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they were first encountered excluding the current `j`, and `j` is the next element in the updated `pl` that satisfies d[j] >= 3. If `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is set to 0 + (d[j] // 3); otherwise, `shapes` remains 0.**
