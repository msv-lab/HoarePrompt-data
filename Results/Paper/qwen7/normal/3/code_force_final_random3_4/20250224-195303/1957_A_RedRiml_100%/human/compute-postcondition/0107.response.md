Based on the initial state provided:

- `d` is a dictionary where the count of each element in `palka` is stored.
- `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they were first encountered, with all elements that do not satisfy `d[j] >= 3` removed from `pl`.
- `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.

Let's break down the calculation of `shapes`:

1. **Dictionary `d`:** This dictionary contains the count of each element in `palka`.
2. **List `pl`:** This list contains unique elements from `palka` that have a count in `d` greater than or equal to 3, in the order they were first encountered.
3. **Calculation of `shapes`:** For each element `j` in `pl`, if `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, add `d[j] // 3` to `shapes`.

Given this, `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `shapes`.

Output: **shapes (where shapes is the sum of d[j] // 3 for all j in pl where d[j] is greater than or equal to 3)**
