Output State: **`palka` is a non-empty list of integers, `d` is a dictionary where for each integer `i` from `palka`, if `i` is not in `d`, then `d[i]` is set to 1. If `i` is already in `d`, then `d[i]` is incremented by 1; `pl` is the same as `palka`.**

Explanation: The code `pl.append(i)` appends the integer `i` to the list `pl`, which is the same as `palka` since `palka` is the initial state. The dictionary `d` remains unchanged in this line of code as no operations are performed on it. The condition for updating the dictionary `d` (checking if `i` is in `d` and incrementing its value) is handled before this line of code. Therefore, the output state retains the information about `palka` and `d` as per the initial postcondition, and updates `pl` to reflect the current state of `palka`.
