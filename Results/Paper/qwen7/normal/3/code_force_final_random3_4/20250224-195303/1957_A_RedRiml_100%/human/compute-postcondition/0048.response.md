Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `shapes` is increased by `d[j] // 3 + d[j] // 3`
- `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` excluding the first element
- The current value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3

### Loop Head
The loop is defined as:
```python
for j in pl:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables in the loop head are `j` and `pl`.
2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration**: The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements in `pl`.
3. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since `j` is an iterator over `pl`, the next value of `j` will be the next element in `pl`.
   - `pl` itself should be adjusted to exclude the current element `j` (since it is being iterated over).

### Adjusted State
- `shapes` remains unchanged as it is not directly modified within the loop head.
- `pl` should be adjusted to exclude the current value of `j`.
- The current value of `d[j]` is no longer relevant for the next iteration since `j` changes.

### Final State
- `shapes` is the same as before.
- `pl` is adjusted to exclude the current value of `j`.
- The current value of `d[j]` is no longer relevant, but we know it was greater than or equal to 3.

So, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`shapes` is increased by `d[j] // 3 + d[j] // 3`, `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` excluding the first element and the current value of `j`, and the current value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.**
