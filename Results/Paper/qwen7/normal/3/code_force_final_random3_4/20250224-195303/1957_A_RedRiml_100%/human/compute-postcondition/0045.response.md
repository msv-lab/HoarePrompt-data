Output State: **`shapes` is increased by `d[j] // 3 + d[j] // 3`, `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` excluding the first element, and the current value of `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3**.

Explanation: The code `shapes += d[j] // 3` increases the value of `shapes` by `d[j] // 3`. Since `d[j]` is already greater than or equal to 3, the value of `d[j] // 3` is a specific integer. The value of `pl` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
