Output State: **`palka` is a non-empty list of integers; `d` is a dictionary with key `i` assigned the value `1`.**

The code snippet `d[i] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the key `i` in the dictionary `d`. Since `palka` is a non-empty list of integers and no changes were made to it, its state remains unchanged. The dictionary `d` now contains the key `i` with the value `1`.
