Output State: `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `d` is a dictionary where the count of each element in `palka` is stored, and `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they were first encountered, with all elements that do not satisfy `d[j] >= 3` removed from `pl`.

In simpler terms, `shapes` will be the total number of times the condition `d[j] >= 3` is met across all unique elements in `palka`, divided by 3, summed up. The dictionary `d` and the list `pl` will only contain elements that meet the condition `d[j] >= 3`, and `pl` will reflect the order in which these elements were first encountered in `palka`.
