Output State: **`shapes` is 0**.

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `shapes`. Since `shapes` was previously defined as the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, setting `shapes` to 0 overrides its previous value. No other variables are affected by this line of code.
