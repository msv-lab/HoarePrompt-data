Output State: **`shapes` is 0, `palka` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary with keys as elements from `palka` and values as their respective counts, and `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka` in the order they appeared.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `shapes` to 0. The variables `palka`, `d`, and `pl` remain unchanged from their initial state, which means `palka` is still an empty list, `d` is a dictionary with keys as elements from `palka` and values as their respective counts (which is still an empty dictionary since `palka` is empty), and `pl` is still a list of unique elements from `palka` in the order they appeared (which is also an empty list since no elements have been added to `palka`).
