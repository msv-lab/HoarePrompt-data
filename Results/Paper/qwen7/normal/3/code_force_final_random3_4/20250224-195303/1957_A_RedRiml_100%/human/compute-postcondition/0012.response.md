Output State: **`d` is updated such that `d[i]` is incremented by 1, `palka` contains at least one element, and `d.get(i)` is not None.**

Explanation: The code `d[i] += 1` increments the value of `d[i]` by 1. Since `d.get(i)` is not None, it means that `i` is a key in dictionary `d`. The precondition that `palka` must contain at least one element remains unchanged.
