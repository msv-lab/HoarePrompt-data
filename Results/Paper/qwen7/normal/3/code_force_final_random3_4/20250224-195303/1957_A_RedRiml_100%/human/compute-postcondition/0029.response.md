Output State: **`palka` contains at least one element, `i` is the next element in `palka`, `d[i]` is now set to 1, and `pl` is a list containing the next element in `palka`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `d[i] = 1` sets the value of `d[i]` to 1. Since `d[i]` was previously `None` (implied by the problem statement), it is now explicitly set to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
