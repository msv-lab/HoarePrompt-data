Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `t`**: The problem statement mentions that `t` is an input integer. This means that `t` can be any positive integer, but it must be a valid input for the loop to execute.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**: For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1 because `range(t)` generates numbers from 0 to `t-1`. If `t` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since `t` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to ensure that `t` is a positive integer (greater than or equal to 1).

Given the above steps, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: `t` must be a positive integer (greater than or equal to 1)**.
