Based on the initial state provided:

- `qs` must contain at least one element.
- `n` is the first element in `qs`.
- `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `n` is the first element of `qs`.
2. `res` is a list that contains the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it. Since `n` is the first element of `qs`, `res` will have a single element, which is the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

When `map(str, res)` is applied, it converts the single element in `res` to a string. Then, `' '.join(...)` joins these strings with a space separator.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output the result of `func_1(n, p)` converted to a string.

Output: **'result_of_func_1(n, p)' (where result_of_func_1(n, p) is the string representation of the result of func_1(n, p))**
