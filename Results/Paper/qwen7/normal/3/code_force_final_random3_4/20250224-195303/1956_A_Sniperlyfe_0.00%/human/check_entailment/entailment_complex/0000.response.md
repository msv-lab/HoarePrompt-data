### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `n` (the initial number of players) and `p` (a list of integers representing positions to remove players).
   - The function iteratively reduces `n` by the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n` as long as `n` is greater than or equal to the smallest element in `p`.
   - The loop continues until `n` is less than the smallest element in `p`.
   - The function returns `0` once the loop terminates.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `k` and `q`, followed by the list `p` and the list `qs`.
   - It then applies `func_1` to each element in `qs` and collects the results in a list `res`.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

3. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly simulates the game's process of removing players according to the specified positions.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly processes each test case and prints the results as required.
   - The overall structure of the program matches the problem description and the provided examples.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
