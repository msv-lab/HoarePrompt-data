Output State: `qs` must contain all its original elements, `n` is the last element in `qs`, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` appended to all previous results from each iteration of the loop.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `n` will be set to the last element in the original `qs` list, and `res` will be a list that contains the result of `func_1(n, p)` for every element `n` in `qs`.
