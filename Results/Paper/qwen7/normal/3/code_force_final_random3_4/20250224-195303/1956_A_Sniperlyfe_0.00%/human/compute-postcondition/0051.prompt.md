Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `k` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 100; `p` is a list of k positive integers representing the sequence a where 1 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k <= 100; `qs` is a list of q positive integers representing n_i where 1 <= n_i <= 100; `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    k, q = map(int, input().split())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    res = []
    for n in qs:
        res.append(func_1(n, p))
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The list `res` will contain the results of applying `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: `k` is the first integer input converted to an integer, `q` is the second integer input converted to an integer, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers with all elements processed, `n` is the last element in `qs` that was used in the loop.

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations, processing every element in `qs`. The `res` list now contains the result of applying `func_1(n, p)` to each element `n` in `qs`, in the order they appeared. The `qs` list is now empty since all its elements have been consumed by the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `qs` must contain all its original elements, `n` is the last element in `qs`, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` appended to all previous results from each iteration of the loop.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `n` will be set to the last element in the original `qs` list, and `res` will be a list that contains the result of `func_1(n, p)` for every element `n` in `qs`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
