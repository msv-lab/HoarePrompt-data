Output State: **`k` is the first integer input converted to an integer, `q` is the second integer input converted to an integer, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers with all elements processed, `n` is the last element in `qs` that was used in the loop, `k` is updated to the first integer input, and `q` is updated to the second integer input, and `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `p`. The values of `k`, `q`, `res`, `qs`, `n`, `k`, and `q` remain unchanged from their previous states.
