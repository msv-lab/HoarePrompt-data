The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs`. Here, `k` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 100. `p` is a list of `k` positive integers representing a sequence `a` where 1 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k <= 100. `qs` is a list of `q` positive integers representing `n_i` where 1 <= n_i <= 100.

For each integer `n_i` in `qs`, the function checks if `n_i` exists in the sequence `p`. If `n_i` is found in `p`, the function does not return anything for that particular `n_i`. However, if `n_i` is not found in `p`, the function returns an indication that `n_i` is not in the sequence `p`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a sequence `p` and a list of integers `qs`, and for each integer `n_i` in `qs`, check if `n_i` is present in the sequence `p`. If `n_i` is not found in `p`, the function indicates that `n_i` is not in the sequence `p`.
