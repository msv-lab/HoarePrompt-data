Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` contains the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
- `n` is the next element in `qs`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

To determine what will be printed, let's break down the process:

1. `map(str, res)` applies the `str` function to each element in `res`, converting each element to a string.
2. `' '.join(...)` joins these string representations with a space as the separator.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output a single string where the elements of `res` are concatenated with spaces in between.

Since the exact contents of `res` are not specified, we can only describe it in terms of the elements it contains.

Output: **a string with elements of res separated by spaces**
