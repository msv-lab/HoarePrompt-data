Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for n in qs:`. The variables involved here are `n` and `qs`.

2. **Determine the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
   - `k` is the first integer input converted to an integer.
   - `q` is the second integer input converted to an integer.
   - `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
   - `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.
   - `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers that must not be an empty list.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `qs`. After each iteration, `n` will take the next value from `qs`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `qs` must still contain at least one element. Therefore, `n` will be set to the next element in `qs`, and `qs` will be updated to exclude the current `n`.

Given these points, the state adjustments needed for the next iteration are:

- `n` will be the next element in `qs`.
- `qs` will be the remaining elements in `qs` after removing the current `n`.

Since the exact values of `n` and the updated `qs` depend on the specific elements in `qs`, we can express the new state as follows:

**State: **`k` is the first integer input converted to an integer, `q` is the second integer input converted to an integer, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers with at least one element remaining, `n` is the next element in `qs`**.
