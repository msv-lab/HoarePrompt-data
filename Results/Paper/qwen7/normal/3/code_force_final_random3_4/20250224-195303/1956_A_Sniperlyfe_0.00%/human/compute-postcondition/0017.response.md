Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variables involved here are `t` (which controls the number of iterations) and the loop counter (which is represented by `_`).

2. **Understand the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - The list `res` contains the results of applying `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`.
   - The loop has executed for `t-1` times.

3. **Determine the state adjustments needed for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop counter `_` is an underscore (`_`), it is a placeholder indicating that the specific variable used as the loop counter is not explicitly named in the loop head. However, the loop counter is incremented with each iteration.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than the current number of iterations, which is `t-1`.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that `t` is greater than the current value of `t-1`.

**Step-by-step reasoning**:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `t` was used to control the number of iterations.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than the current number of iterations, which is `t-1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `t` must be greater than `t-1`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`res` is a list of results from applying `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`, `t` must be greater than `t-1`**
