Output State: `qs` must contain all its original elements, `n` is the last element in `qs`, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` appended to all previous results from each iteration of the loop.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `qs` will still have all its original elements since no elements are removed or modified within the loop. The variable `n` will hold the value of the last element from the original `qs`. The list `res` will contain the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended for each element `n` that was iterated over in `qs`.
