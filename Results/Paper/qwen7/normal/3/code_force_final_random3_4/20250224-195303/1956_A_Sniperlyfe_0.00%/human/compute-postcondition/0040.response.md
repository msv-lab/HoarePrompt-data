Output State: **`qs` must contain at least one element, `n` is the first element in `qs`, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.**

Explanation:
- The loop `for n in qs:` iterates over each element in `qs`.
- Before the loop starts, `n` is set to the first element in `qs`.
- The function call `res.append(func_1(n, p))` appends the result of `func_1(n, p)` to the list `res`.
- Since `n` is the first element in `qs`, `res` now contains the result of `func_1(first_element_of_qs, p)`.
