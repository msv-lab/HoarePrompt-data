Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining the number of winners in a game based on a specific sequence of positions to kick out players.
- The `func_1` function is designed to simulate the process of kicking out players according to the sequence `p` until no more players can be kicked out.
- The `func_2` function is designed to handle multiple test cases, reading the necessary inputs and calling `func_1` for each test case.
- The execution summary of `func_2` indicates that it correctly processes each test case by reading the required inputs and applying `func_1` to each initial player count `n`.
- The `func_1` function correctly implements the logic to simulate the game's rounds and determine the final number of players remaining, which aligns with the problem description.
- Since both functions are designed to work together to solve the problem as described, and their execution summaries indicate correct behavior, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
