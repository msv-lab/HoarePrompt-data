To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `res` is a list.
   - `res` contains the result of `func_1(res[-1], p)` appended to it.
   - `n` is the next element in `qs`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
   ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

- **`res`**: This list contains one element, which is the result of `func_1(res[-1], p)`. Here, `res[-1]` refers to the last element in the list `res`, and `p` is a parameter passed to the function `func_1`.
  
- **`map(str, res)`**: The `map` function applies the `str` function to each element in `res`. Since `res` contains only one element, `map(str, res)` will return an iterator with a single string element, which is the string representation of the result of `func_1(res[-1], p)`.

- **`' '.join(map(str, res))`**: The `join` method concatenates the elements of the iterator returned by `map(str, res)` into a single string, with each element separated by a space.

### Conclusion:

The print statement will output the string representation of the result of `func_1(res[-1], p)`, with a space separating the elements if there were more than one. However, since `res` contains only one element, there will be no spaces in the output.

### Final Output:

Output: **the string representation of the result of func_1(res[-1], p)**
