Output State: **`qs` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `n` is the last element in `qs` that was used in the loop, `k` is updated to the first integer input, and `q` is updated to the second integer input, and `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers.**

Explanation: The code `qs = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `qs`. The variable `n` is set to the last element in `qs` since it is the last element processed in the context of the loop. The variables `k` and `q` are updated to the first and second integers input, respectively. The variable `p` remains unchanged as it was defined before this line of code and is not affected by it.
