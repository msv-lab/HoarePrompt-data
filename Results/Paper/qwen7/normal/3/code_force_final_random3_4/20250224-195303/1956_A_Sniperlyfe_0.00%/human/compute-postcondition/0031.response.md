Output State: `k` is the first integer input converted to an integer, `q` is the second integer input converted to an integer, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`, `p` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `qs` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers with all elements processed, `n` is no longer defined as it has been iterated over all elements in `qs`.

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations, and `res` contains the output of `func_1(n, p)` for every `n` in the original `qs`. The `qs` list is now empty since all its elements have been processed. The variables `k` and `q` remain unchanged as they were set in the initial state and are not affected by the loop.
