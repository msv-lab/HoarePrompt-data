Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. The logic inside the loop checks the conditions and calculates the maximum profit according to the problem statement:
   - If `b <= a`, the profit is simply `n * a` because selling all buns at the usual price `a` gives the maximum profit.
   - If `b - a >= n`, the profit is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, which is `(2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2`. This is because selling the first `n` buns at the modified prices starting from `b` down to `b-n+1` gives the maximum profit.
   - Otherwise, the profit is calculated by selling the first `b - a + 1` buns at the modified prices and the rest at the usual price `a`.

Given the logic and the conditions, the program appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem.

Correctness: **True**
