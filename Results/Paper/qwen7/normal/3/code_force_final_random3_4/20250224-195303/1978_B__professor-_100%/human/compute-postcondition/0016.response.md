Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `t` is reduced by 1, so `t = t - 1`.
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `a` is the second integer input.
- `b` is the third integer input.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(n * a)
```

Here, `n` and `a` are explicitly defined as the first and second integer inputs respectively. Therefore, the expression `n * a` will be evaluated with these values.

Output: **n * a (where n is the first integer input and a is the second integer input)**
