Given the initial state:
- `t` is 1
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `a` is the second integer from the input

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print(n * a)
```

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. `n` is the first integer from the input.
2. `a` is the second integer from the input.
3. The expression `n * a` multiplies the first integer by the second integer.
4. The result of this multiplication is then printed.

Therefore, the output will be the product of the first and second integers from the input.

Output: **n * a (where n is the first integer from the input and a is the second integer from the input)**
