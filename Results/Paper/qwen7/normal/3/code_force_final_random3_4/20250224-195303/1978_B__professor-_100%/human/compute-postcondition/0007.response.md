Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `a` is the second integer input.
- `b` is the third integer input.
- `b` is greater than `a`.
- The difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`.

We need to evaluate the expression inside the `print` function: \(\text{int}((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)\).

Let's break it down:

1. \(2 * b - n + 1\): This is a calculation involving `b` and `n`.
2. \((2 * b - n + 1) * n\): This multiplies the result from step 1 by `n`.
3. \((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2\): This divides the result from step 2 by 2 and takes the integer part (floor division).

Since the exact values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not specified, we can't determine the exact numerical value. However, we can describe the expression in terms of these variables.

Output: **int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)**
