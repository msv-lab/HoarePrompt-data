### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize Bob's profit by choosing an optimal `k` such that the first `k` buns are sold at a modified price `(b - i + 1)` and the rest at the usual price `a`.
   - We need to consider different scenarios based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It checks the conditions to determine the optimal `k` and calculates the profit accordingly.

3. **Case Analysis:**
   - **Case 1:** If `b <= a`, the best strategy is to sell all buns at the usual price `a`. This is handled correctly by printing `n * a`.
   - **Case 2:** If `b - a >= n`, the best strategy is to sell all buns at the modified price. This is also handled correctly by printing `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)`.
   - **Case 3:** Otherwise, the code calculates the profit using the formula `int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)`. This formula accounts for the sum of the arithmetic series for the modified prices and the usual price for the remaining buns.

4. **Verification:**
   - The logic in the code matches the problem statement and the examples provided.
   - The conditions and formulas used are correct for the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit for each test case based on the provided conditions.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
