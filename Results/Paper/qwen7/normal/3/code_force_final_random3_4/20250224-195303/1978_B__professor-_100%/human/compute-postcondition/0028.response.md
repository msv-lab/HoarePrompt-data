Output State: **t is 1, n is the first integer from the input, a is the second integer from the input, b is the third integer from the input.**

In this final state, the loop has completed all its iterations, and since the loop runs `t` times initially, after executing `t` times, `t` becomes 1. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are re-read from the input at the start of each iteration, but since there is only one iteration left (`t=1`), these values do not change again. Thus, `t` is now 1, and `n`, `a`, and `b` retain their values from the last input provided before the loop finished.
