Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is the first integer from the input, `a` is the second integer from the input, `b` is the third integer from the input.**

Explanation: The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively. The variable `t` remains unchanged and is still equal to 1.
