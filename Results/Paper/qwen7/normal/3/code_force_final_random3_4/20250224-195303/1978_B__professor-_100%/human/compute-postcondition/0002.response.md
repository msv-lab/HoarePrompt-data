Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer input, `a` is the second integer input, `b` is the third integer input.**

The code splits the input into three integers and assigns them to `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the operation.
