Postcondition: **`ans` is updated to be the minimum value between its current value and `cnt`. `i` is equal to an input integer, `tmp` is equal to `a[0]`, and `cnt` remains the maximum count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` in the list `a`; `aa` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `a`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged regardless of the if condition.**
