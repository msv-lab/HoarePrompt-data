Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and implicitly an integer `t`. For each test case, it determines if the list `a` is beautiful (i.e., all elements are the same). If `a` is beautiful, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of the first element in `a` and prints this value. The function outputs the minimum such count across all test cases.**
