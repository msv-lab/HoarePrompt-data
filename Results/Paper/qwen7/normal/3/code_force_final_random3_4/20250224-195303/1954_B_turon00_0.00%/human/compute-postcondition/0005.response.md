Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `aa` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `aa = set(a)` creates a set from the list `a`, which removes any duplicate elements in `a` and stores them in `aa`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, and `tmp`) remain unchanged.
