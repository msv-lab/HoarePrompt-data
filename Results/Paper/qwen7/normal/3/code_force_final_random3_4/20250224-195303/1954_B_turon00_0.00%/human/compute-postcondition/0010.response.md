Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `aa` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `a`. After the execution of the if-else block, the set `aa` contains exactly one unique element, meaning all elements in the list `a` are the same.
