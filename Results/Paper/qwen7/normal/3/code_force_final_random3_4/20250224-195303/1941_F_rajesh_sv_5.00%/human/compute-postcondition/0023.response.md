Output State: **`max_diff` is the maximum difference found so far, `next_max_diff` is `A[4] - A[3]`, `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurred or `None` if no valid index was found, `i` is 5, and `diff` is `A[4] - A[3]`.**

Explanation: The code sets `next_max_diff` to the value of `diff`, which is `A[4] - A[3]`. The other variables (`max_diff`, `index`, `i`, and `diff`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
