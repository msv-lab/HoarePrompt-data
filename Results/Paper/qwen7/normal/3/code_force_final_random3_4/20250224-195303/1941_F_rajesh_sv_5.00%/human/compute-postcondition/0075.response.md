Output State: **`f` is the next value in the sequence defined by `F`; `l` is the index obtained by bisecting the list `D` with the value `left - f`; `h` is `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1` to `h`. The values of `f`, `l`, and `D` remain unchanged from their initial state. The variable `h` now holds the value of the leftmost index in the list `D` where the value `right - f` would be inserted, minus one.
