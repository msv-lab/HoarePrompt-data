Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `total` is undefined, `students` is undefined, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `l` is `mid + 1`, `h` must be greater than `l`, and `l` must be less than `h`.**

Explanation: The line `l = mid + 1` updates the value of `l` to `mid + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
