Postcondition: **`max_diff` is the maximum difference found so far, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference or `-inf` if no other differences were found, `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurred or `None` if no valid index was found, `i` is 5, and if `diff > max_diff`, `max_diff` is updated to `diff` and `index` is set to 5; otherwise, if `diff > next_max_diff`, `next_max_diff` is updated to `diff`.**
