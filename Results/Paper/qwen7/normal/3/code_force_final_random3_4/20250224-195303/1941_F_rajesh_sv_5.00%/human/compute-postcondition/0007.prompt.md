Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `testcases' is the result of calling `func_3()`. All other variables retain their initial states: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= m, k <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 2 * 10^9 and a_i < a_{i+1}, `d` is a list of m integers where 1 <= d_i <= 10^9, and `f` is a list of k integers where 1 <= f_i <= 10^9.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(testcases):
    func_6()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `func_6()` has been called.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `func_6()` has been called

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `func_6()` has been called




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
