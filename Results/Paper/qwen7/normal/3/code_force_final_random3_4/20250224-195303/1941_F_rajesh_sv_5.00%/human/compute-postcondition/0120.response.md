Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `total` is undefined, `students` is undefined, `left` must be less than `right` plus `f`, and `l < h` must be true.**

Explanation: The code updates the values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` by reassigning them to `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f`, respectively. The other variables (`total`, `students`, `left`, `l`, and `h`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
