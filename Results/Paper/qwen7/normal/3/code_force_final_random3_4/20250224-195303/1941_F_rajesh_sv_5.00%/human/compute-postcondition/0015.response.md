Postcondition: `max_diff` is `-inf`, `next_max_diff` is `diff`, `index` is `None`, `i` is `3`, `diff` is `A[1] - A[0]`, and `diff` is greater than or equal to `-inf`.

This postcondition summarizes that if `diff` is greater than `next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is updated to `diff`, and other variables (`max_diff`, `index`, `i`, and `diff`) are set accordingly. Since there is no else part, these changes are the final state of the program after the if statement executes.
