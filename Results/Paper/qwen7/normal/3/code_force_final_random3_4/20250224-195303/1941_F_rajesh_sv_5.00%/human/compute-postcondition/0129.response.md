Postcondition: **`mid` and `h` are updated based on the comparison between `mid_sum - left` and `right - mid_next_sum`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `mid` is updated to `mid + 1` and `h` is updated to `mid`. Otherwise, `mid` remains as `l + (h - l) // 2` and `h` is updated to `mid`. `total` and `students` remain undefined.**
