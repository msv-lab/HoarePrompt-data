Output State: **`max_diff` is the maximum difference found in the entire array A; `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference or -inf if no such difference exists; `index` is the index where `max_diff` occurred or None if no valid index was found; `i` is n; `diff` is `A[n-2] - A[n-3]; `left` is `A[index - 1]`; `right` is `A[index]; `ans` is `max_diff`.**

Explanation: The line `ans = max_diff` assigns the value of `max_diff` to the variable `ans`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `i`, `diff`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged.
