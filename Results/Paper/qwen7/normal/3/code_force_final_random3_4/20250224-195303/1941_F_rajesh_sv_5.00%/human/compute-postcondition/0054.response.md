To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the loop condition `l < h`. The variables involved in this condition are `l` and `h`.

Given the loop condition `l < h`, the loop can continue as long as `l` is less than `h`. At the end of the previous iteration, we know:

- `l` is the smallest index where `D[l]` is greater than or equal to `left - f`, and `l` is less than `h`.
- `h` is either `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1` or `mid`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must still be less than `h`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `l` remains less than `h`.

Let's break down the possible adjustments:

1. **Adjusting `l`:**
   - Since `l` is the smallest index where `D[l]` is greater than or equal to `left - f`, and `l` is less than `h`, `l` cannot be increased without violating the condition `l < h`.
   - However, `l` could be updated to `mid + 1` if `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`. This would change the value of `l`.

2. **Adjusting `h`:**
   - `h` is either `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1` or `mid`.
   - `h` can be decreased if `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, and `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. This would change the value of `h`.

Since the loop condition is `l < h`, both `l` and `h` can be adjusted to ensure the loop continues. However, the problem specifies that we should only adjust the states of objects in the loop head.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `l` and `h`.

State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `h` is either `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1` or `mid`, `l` is the index such that all elements in `D` before index `l` are less than `left - f`, and `l` is the smallest index where `D[l]` is greater than or equal to `left - f`, and `l` is less than `h`, and both `l` and `h` can be adjusted to ensure `l < h`**.
