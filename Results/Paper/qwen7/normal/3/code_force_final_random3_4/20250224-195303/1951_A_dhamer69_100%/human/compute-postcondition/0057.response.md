Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string from the user, and `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`.**

Explanation: The code `count_1 = s.count('1')` counts the number of times the character '1' appears in the string `s` and assigns this count to the variable `count_1`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` must still be greater than 1, `n` remains an input integer, `s` remains an input string from the user, and `count_1` is now the number of times '1' appears in `s`.
