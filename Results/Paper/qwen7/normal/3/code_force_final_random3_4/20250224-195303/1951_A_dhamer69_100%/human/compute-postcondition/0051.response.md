Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, and `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`; `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`**.

This means that the value of `n` is updated to the integer input from the user, while the other variables retain their initial conditions.
