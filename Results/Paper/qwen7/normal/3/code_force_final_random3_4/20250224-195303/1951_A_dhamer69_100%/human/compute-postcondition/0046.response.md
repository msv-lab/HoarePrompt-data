Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`. If `count_1 % 2 != 0`, no changes are made. Otherwise, if `s.count('11') == 1` and `count_1 == 2`, no changes are made. In all other cases, no changes are made.**
