The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is `t - 1`. For the loop to be executed one more time, `t` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, and `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`**
