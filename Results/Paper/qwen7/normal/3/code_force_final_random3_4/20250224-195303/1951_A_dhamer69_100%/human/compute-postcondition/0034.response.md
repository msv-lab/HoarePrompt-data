Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `t > 0`. This means the loop will continue as long as `t` is greater than 0.

2. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `t`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments needed**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0 at the start of the next iteration. Since `t` is modified inside the loop (specifically, `t` is set to `t - 1`), the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 at the start of the next iteration.

4. **Consider the given conditions**:
   - `start` and `end` are integers such that `start` <= `end`.
   - `t` is equal to `t - 1` (this is the modification happening inside the loop).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `s` is an input string.
   - `count_1` is the number of '1's in the string `s`.
   - If `n` equals 2, `s` is either '00' or not '00'.
   - If `n` is not 2, `count_1` is the number of '1's in `s`, and if `count_1` is odd, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. If `count_1` is even, `count_1` is even, and either `s.count('11') == 1` and `count_1 == 2`, or `s.count('11') != 1` or `count_1 != 2`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `t` is modified inside the loop and the loop continues as long as `t > 0`, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 at the start of the next iteration. Given that `t` is decremented by 1 each time through the loop, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 at the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
