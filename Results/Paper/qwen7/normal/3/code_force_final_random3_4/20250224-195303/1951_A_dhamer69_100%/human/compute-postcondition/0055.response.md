Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `s` is now an input string from the user, and `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`. The postcondition does not change regardless of whether `s` equals '00' or not, as both the if and else parts do not alter these variables.
