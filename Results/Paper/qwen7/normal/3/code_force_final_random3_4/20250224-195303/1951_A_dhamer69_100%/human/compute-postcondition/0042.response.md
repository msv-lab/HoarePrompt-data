Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0 (though its value is not needed for the print statement).
- `n` is an input integer (its value is not needed for the print statement).
- `s` is an input string (its value is not needed for the print statement).
- `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`.

The print statement is simply:

```python
print('NO')
```

This will directly print the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
