Based on the initial state provided:

- `start` is an integer.
- `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s` is an input string with exactly two '1's.
- `count_1` is the number of '1's in the string `s` and is currently even.
- `s` contains exactly one instance of '11'.
- `n` is not equal to 2.

The code snippet provided is simply:
```python
