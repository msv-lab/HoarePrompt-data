Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n_cases = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n_cases`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state and was not affected by the code execution.
