The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer \( n \). For each \( n \), it calculates the smallest integer greater than or equal to the base-2 logarithm of \( n \). If \( n \) is 1, it prints 1. Otherwise, it prints \( 2 \) raised to the calculated power. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.
