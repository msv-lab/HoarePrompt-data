Output State: **`power` is 4, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` must be greater than 5, `i` is either 2 or 5, `n` must be greater than 8**.

Explanation: The value of `power` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The other variables (`t`, `n_cases`, `i`, and `n`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
