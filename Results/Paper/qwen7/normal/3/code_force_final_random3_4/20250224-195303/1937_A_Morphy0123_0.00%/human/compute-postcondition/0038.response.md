Based on the initial state provided:

- `power` is explicitly given as 5.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), but its specific value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- `n_cases` must be greater than 5, but its value is not relevant to the print statement.
- `i` is either 2 or 5, but its value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.
- `n` must be greater than 8, but its value is not relevant to the print statement.
- The current value of `power` is explicitly stated to be equal to `n`, but since `power` is already given as 5, this does not change the value of `power`.

The print statement is `print(2 ** power)`, and since `power` is 5, the expression `2 ** power` evaluates to \(2^5 = 32\).

Output: **32**
