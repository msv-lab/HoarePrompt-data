Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **`power`**: It is stated that `power` is greater than or equal to `log2(n) - 1` but less than `log2(n)`. This means `power` is an integer value that lies between `log2(n) - 1` and `log2(n)` (not inclusive of `log2(n)`).

2. **`n`**: `n` is an integer input from the user and must be greater than 128.

3. **`2 ** power`**: We need to determine the value of `2 ** power`. Since `power` is between `log2(n) - 1` and `log2(n)`, let's consider the range:
   - If `n > 128`, then `log2(n) > log2(128) = 7`.
   - Therefore, `power` is between 6 and 7 (since it is an integer).

Given that `power` is an integer between 6 and 7, the only possible integer value for `power` is 6 because it cannot be 7 (as it is less than `log2(n)`).

So, `2 ** power` will be `2 ** 6`, which equals 64.

Output: **64**
