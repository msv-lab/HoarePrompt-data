Output State: **Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` is the total number of cases entered by the user, `i` is the last index processed by the loop (ranging from 1 to `n_cases`), `n` is the integer input from the user for the current case, and `power` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the base-2 logarithm of `n`. If `n` equals 1, `power` is set to 4. Otherwise, if `power` equals `n`, it remains unchanged; otherwise, `power` is adjusted to be within the range `[log2(n) - 1, log2(n))`.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `t` will still be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). The variable `n_cases` will reflect the total number of inputs provided by the user. For each input `n` processed by the loop, `power` will be calculated as described, ensuring it is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the base-2 logarithm of `n`. If `n` is 1, `power` will be set to 4. If `n` is a power of 2, `power` will be set to that power of 2. Otherwise, `power` will be the largest power of 2 less than `n`.
