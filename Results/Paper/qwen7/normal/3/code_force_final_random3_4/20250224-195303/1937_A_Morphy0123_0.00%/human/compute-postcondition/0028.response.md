Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` must be greater than 5, `i` is either 2 or 5, `n` is an input integer, `power` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 8 if `i` is 5, otherwise `power` is not equal to `n`.**

Explanation: The code sets `power` to 1. This updates the value of `power` from its previous value (which was 4 if `i` was 2, or not equal to `n` if `i` was 5) to 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
