Output State: **`power` is greater than or equal to `log2(n) - 1` but less than `log2(n)`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` must be greater than 5, `i` is either 3 or 6, `n` is the integer input from the user and must be greater than 128, `power` is not equal to `n`**.

Explanation: The value of `power` is decremented by 1. Given the initial condition that `power` is greater than or equal to `log2(n)` but less than `log2(n) + 1`, after decrementing by 1, `power` will now be greater than or equal to `log2(n) - 1` but less than `log2(n)`. All other conditions remain unchanged.
