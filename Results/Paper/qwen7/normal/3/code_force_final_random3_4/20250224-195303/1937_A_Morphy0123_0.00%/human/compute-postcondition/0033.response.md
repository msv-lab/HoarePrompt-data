Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `power < log2(n)`.
2. **Determine the current state**: 
   - `power` is 3.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n_cases` must be greater than 5.
   - `i` is either 2 or 5.
   - `n` must be at least 9.

3. **Check the loop condition with the current state**:
   - For the loop to continue, `power` must be less than `log2(n)`.
   - Given `power` is 3, we need `log2(n)` to be greater than 3.
   - This means \(n > 2^3 = 8\).

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - The only variables involved in the loop condition are `power` and `n`.
   - Since `power` is fixed at 3, we need to ensure `log2(n)` is greater than 3, which means `n` must be greater than 8.
   - Additionally, since `n` must be at least 9 (from the given constraints), this condition is already satisfied.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure `n` is greater than 8.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`power` is 3, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` must be greater than 5, `i` is either 2 or 5, `n` must be greater than 8**
