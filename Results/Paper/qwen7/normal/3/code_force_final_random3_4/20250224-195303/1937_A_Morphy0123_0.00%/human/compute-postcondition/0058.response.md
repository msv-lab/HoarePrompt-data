Output State: `power` is greater than or equal to `log2(n)` but less than `log2(n) + 1`; `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n_cases` must be greater than 5; `i` is either 3 or 6; `n` is the integer input from the user and must be greater than 128.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `power` until it is no longer less than `log2(n)`. Given that the loop executed 3 times and `n` must be greater than 128, `power` will be incremented to a value that is just less than or equal to `log2(n)`. Therefore, the final value of `power` will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)`, which is effectively `ceil(log2(n))`. All other variables remain unchanged as they were not modified within the loop.
