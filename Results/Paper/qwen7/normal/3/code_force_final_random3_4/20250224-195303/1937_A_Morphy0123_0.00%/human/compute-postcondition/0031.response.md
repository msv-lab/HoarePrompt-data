Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `power < log2(n)`.
2. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `power` is 2.
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n_cases` must be greater than 5.
   - `i` is either 2 or 5.
   - `n` must be greater than 8.

3. **Determine Which Variables Affect the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition involves `power` and `log2(n)`. Therefore, we need to focus on these two variables.

4. **Analyze the Current Values**:
   - `power` is currently 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 8.

5. **Determine the Next State for the Loop to Execute Again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `power` must be less than `log2(n)`.
   - Since `power` is currently 2, `log2(n)` must be greater than 2.
   - The smallest integer value for `n` that satisfies `log2(n) > 2` is 4 (since \(log2(4) = 2\)). However, `n` must be greater than 8, so `n` must be at least 9.

6. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `log2(n)` is greater than 2, which means `n` must be at least 9.
   - No other states need to be adjusted as they do not affect the loop condition directly.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

State: **`power` is 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n_cases` must be greater than 5, `i` is either 2 or 5, `n` must be at least 9**
