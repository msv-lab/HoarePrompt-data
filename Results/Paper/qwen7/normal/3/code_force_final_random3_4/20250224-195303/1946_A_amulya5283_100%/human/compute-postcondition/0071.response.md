Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 1`, `res` is incremented by 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `res += 1` increments the value of `res` by 1. No other variables are affected, so their previous values remain unchanged. The precondition that `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user also remains valid.
