Output State: `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `res` is incremented by 1 for every occurrence where `a[mdx]` equals `a[i]`, and `n` is an integer not equal to 1 with `mdx < n`.

In this final output state, the variable `mdx` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. The variable `i` will be set to `n - 1` because the loop iterates from `mdx` to `n-1`. The variable `res` will contain the total count of elements in the list `a` that are equal to `a[mdx]` (excluding `a[mdx]` itself). The conditions on `n` and `mdx` remain the same as they were initially and throughout the loop iterations.
