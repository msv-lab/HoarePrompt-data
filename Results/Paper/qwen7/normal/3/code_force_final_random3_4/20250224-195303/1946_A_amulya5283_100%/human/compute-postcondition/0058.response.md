Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `-1`, `res` contains the total count of elements in the list `a` starting from index `mdx` (which is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`) that are equal to `a[mdx]`, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the user input, converts each integer to an int, and stores them in a list `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `mdx`, `i`, and `res` remain unchanged from their initial state.
