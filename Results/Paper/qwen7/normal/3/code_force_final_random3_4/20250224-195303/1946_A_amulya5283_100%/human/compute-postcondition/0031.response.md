The code `t -= 1` decrements the value of `t` by 1. Given that `t` is initially greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, the only way this can be true is if `t` is 1. After decrementing `t` by 1, `t` becomes 0. The other variables (`n`, `mdx`, `i`, and `res`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an integer, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `res` contains the total count of elements in the list `a` that are equal to `a[mdx]` (excluding `a[mdx]` itself)**
