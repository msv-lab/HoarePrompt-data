Output State: `t` is 0, `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in the last test case, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `-1`, `res` contains the total count of elements in the list `a` starting from index `mdx` (which is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`) that are equal to `a[mdx]`, and `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user for the last test case.

This output state indicates that all test cases have been processed (`t` is 0), and the loop has completed all its iterations. For the last test case, `n` represents the number of elements in the input list `a`, `mdx` is calculated based on `n`, `i` is set to `-1` because the loop has finished, `res` holds the count of elements in `a` that are equal to `a[mdx]` from index `mdx` to the end of the list, and `a` remains a sorted list of integers as it was initially provided for the last test case.
