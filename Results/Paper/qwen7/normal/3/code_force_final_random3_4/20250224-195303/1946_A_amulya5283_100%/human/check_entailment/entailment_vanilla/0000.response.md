Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median of the array. An operation consists of incrementing any element in the array by 1.

2. **Median Calculation**: The median is defined as the middle element in a sorted array. If the array has an odd number of elements, the median is the element at index \(\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil - 1\). If the array has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the elements at indices \(\frac{n}{2} - 1\) and \(\frac{n}{2}\).

3. **Current Implementation Analysis**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - The array is sorted.
   - The code calculates the median index `mdx` which is \( \text{n} // 2 + \text{n} \% 2 - 1 \).
   - The loop iterates from `mdx` to the end of the array and counts how many times the element at `mdx` appears in the array. This count is printed as the result.

4. **Issues with the Current Implementation**:
   - The logic for counting the number of operations to increase the median is flawed. The current implementation simply counts how many times the element at the median position appears in the array after sorting. This does not guarantee the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median.
   - The problem requires increasing the median, not just finding how many elements are equal to the current median.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To find the minimum number of operations, we need to identify the smallest element greater than the current median and calculate the difference between the current median and this element.
   - If the array size is odd, we only need to consider the middle element. If the array size is even, we need to consider both middle elements and choose the one that requires fewer operations to increase.

Given the issues identified, the current implementation does not solve the problem correctly.

Correctness: **False**
