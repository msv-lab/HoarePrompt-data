Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `mdx`, as well as `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - `i` is initialized to `-1`.
   - `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
   - The loop will iterate from `mdx` to `n-1`.

3. **Check if the loop can start**:
   - For the loop to start, `mdx` must be less than or equal to `n-1`. This ensures that there are elements in the range `[mdx, n)`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` is already set to `-1`.
   - `mdx` should be calculated based on `n`.
   - Ensure that `mdx` is less than or equal to `n-1`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `n` must be an input integer.
- `mdx` must be calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
- `mdx` must be less than or equal to `n-1`.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: `t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `mdx` must be less than or equal to `n-1`, `i` is `-1`, `res` is `0`, `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user.**

However, since `t` and `res` are not part of the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted. The relevant states are:

**State: `n` is an input integer, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `mdx` must be less than or equal to `n-1`, `i` is `-1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user.**
