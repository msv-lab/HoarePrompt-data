Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0 and equal to `t - 1`, `n` is an integer, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `res` is incremented by 1 for every occurrence where `a[mdx]` equals `a[i]`, and `res` contains the total count of elements in the list `a` that are equal to `a[mdx]` (excluding `a[mdx]` itself)**.

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the execution of the if-else block. If `n` is 1, the postcondition reflects the initial state since no changes are made. Otherwise, `mdx` is set to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is set to `n - 1`, and `res` is incremented for each match found between `a[mdx]` and `a[i]` during the iteration from `mdx` to `n-1`.
