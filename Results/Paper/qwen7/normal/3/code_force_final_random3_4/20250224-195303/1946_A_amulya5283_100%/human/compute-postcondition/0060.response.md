Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is set to `t - 1`. Since `t` is not defined elsewhere, this line does not affect any existing variable named `t`. It simply reassigns the value of `t` to `t - 1`, but since `t` is not used anywhere else, it doesn't impact the print statement.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. This formula determines the middle index of the list `a` if `n` is odd, or the index just before the middle if `n` is even.
- `i` is initialized to `-1`.
- `res` is the count of elements in the list `a` starting from the index `mdx` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers entered by the user.

The print statement is `print(1)`. This statement will directly print the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
