Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given for loop is `for i in range(mdx, n)`. This means the loop will iterate over values of `i` starting from `mdx` up to but not including `n`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: From the state before the loop, we know that `i` is initially set to `n - 1`.

3. **Determine the value of `mdx`**: The variable `mdx` is defined as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. We need to ensure that `mdx` is correctly calculated based on the value of `n`.

4. **Check the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range `[mdx, n)`. Given that `i` starts at `n - 1`, we need to ensure that `mdx` is less than or equal to `n - 1` for the loop to start.

5. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - `i` should start at `n - 1`.
   - `mdx` should be correctly calculated based on `n`.
   - Ensure that `mdx` is less than or equal to `n - 1`.

Given these points, let's formulate the required state:

- `i` should start at `n - 1`.
- `mdx` should be calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
- Ensure that `mdx` is less than or equal to `n - 1`.

Therefore, the state after adjustment should be:

State: **`t` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `n - 1`, `res` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers created from user input, `mdx` must be less than or equal to `n - 1`**
