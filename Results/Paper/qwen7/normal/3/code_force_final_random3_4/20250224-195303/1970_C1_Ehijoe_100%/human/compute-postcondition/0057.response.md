Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head is `while curr != e:`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `curr`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `curr` is not equal to `e`.

3. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `prev` is equal to `curr`, `tree` contains the elements `s`, `curr`, and `curr` is either the first or the second element of `nodes[curr]` that is not equal to `e`.

4. **Determine the Next State**: For the loop to execute one more time, `curr` must not be equal to `e`. Since `prev` is equal to `curr`, the next value of `curr` should be an element of `nodes[curr]` that is not equal to `e` and is different from `prev`.

5. **Adjust the State**: To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `curr` must be set to one of the elements in `nodes[curr]` that is not equal to `e` and is different from `prev`.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is `curr`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`prev` is equal to `curr`, `tree` contains the elements `s`, `curr`, and `curr` must be one of the elements in `nodes[curr]` that is not equal to `e` and is different from `prev`**
