Output State: **`empty` is True, `t` is an input integer, `u` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `v` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 × 10^5, `edges` is an empty list, `nodes` is a defaultdict where all values are initially set to list.**

Explanation: The code initializes a dictionary named `nodes` using `defaultdict(list)`. This means that `nodes` is now a dictionary where each key maps to a list by default. However, none of the other variables (`empty`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `n`, `edges`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, they retain their initial states.
