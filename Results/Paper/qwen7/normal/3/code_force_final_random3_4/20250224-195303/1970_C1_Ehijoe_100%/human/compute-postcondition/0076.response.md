Postcondition: `prev` is equal to `curr`, `tree` contains all elements from `s` up to and including `e`, `curr` is equal to `e`, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`, `moves` is `[idx, n - idx - 1]`. If at least one move in `moves` is an odd number, the condition remains as is. If none of the moves in `moves` are odd numbers, the condition also remains as is.
