Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `n - 1`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n - 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `u` is an input integer.
   - `v` is an input integer.
   - `nodes[v]` now includes `u`.

4. **Update the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently 0, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1.
   - The condition `i < n - 1` must still hold true. Given that `n` must be at least 2, and `i` is now 1, `n - 1` must be greater than 1, meaning `n` must be at least 3.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be updated to 1.
   - `n` must be at least 3 to ensure the loop continues.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 3, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `nodes[v]` now includes `u`**.
