Output State: **The variable `prev` is equal to `curr`, `tree` contains all elements from `s` up to and including `e`, and `curr` is equal to `e`, and the list `tree` now includes the element `e` appended to it.**

This means that after executing the line `tree.append(e)`, the `tree` list now includes all the elements from `s` to `e`, and both `prev` and `curr` remain equal to `e`.
