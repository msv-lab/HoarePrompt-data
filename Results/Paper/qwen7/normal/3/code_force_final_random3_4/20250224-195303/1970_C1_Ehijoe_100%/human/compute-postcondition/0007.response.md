Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` must be at least 2; `u` is an input integer; `v` is an input integer; `nodes[v]` now includes `u`.**

Explanation: The code `nodes[v].append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the list `nodes[v]`. The values of `i`, `n`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `nodes[u]` now includes `v` is updated to `nodes[v]` now includes `u`.
