Output State: `i` is `n-2`; `n` must be at least 2; `u` is an input integer; `v` is an input integer; `nodes[v]` contains all integers from 1 to n that are connected to `v` through the edges provided by the input.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations (i.e., `i` goes from 0 to `n-2`), the final value of `i` will be `n-2`. The variable `u` and `v` will contain the integers read from the input during each iteration. The `nodes` dictionary will have been updated such that for each node `v` (where `1 ≤ v ≤ n`), the list `nodes[v]` will include all nodes `u` that are connected to `v` via the edges specified in the input.
