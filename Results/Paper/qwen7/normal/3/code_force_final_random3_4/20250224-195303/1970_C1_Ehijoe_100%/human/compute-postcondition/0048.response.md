Postcondition: **`prev` is equal to `curr`, `tree` contains the elements `s` and `curr`, and `curr` is the first element of `nodes[prev]` that is not equal to `e`. If `nodes[curr][0]` is equal to `prev`, then `curr` is the second element of `nodes[s]`. Otherwise, `curr` is the first element of `nodes[old curr]` that is not equal to `e`.**
