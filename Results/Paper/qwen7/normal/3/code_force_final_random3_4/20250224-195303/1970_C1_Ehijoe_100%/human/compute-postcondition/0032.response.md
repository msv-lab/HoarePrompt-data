Output State: The variable `ends` will contain a list of all keys from the dictionary `nodes` whose corresponding value lists have exactly one element. The variable `nodes[key]` remains unchanged after each iteration of the loop. The final state of `ends` will include every key that meets the condition (i.e., `len(nodes[key]) == 1`) from all iterations of the loop.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `ends` will be a list containing all the keys from `nodes` where the corresponding value list has exactly one element.
