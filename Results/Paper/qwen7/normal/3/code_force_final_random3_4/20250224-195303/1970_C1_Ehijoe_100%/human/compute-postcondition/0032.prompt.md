Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n-2`, `n` must be at least 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `nodes[v]` contains all integers from 1 to n that are connected to `v` through the edges provided by the input, `ends` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for key in nodes:
    if len(nodes[key]) == 1:
        ends.append(key)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `nodes[key]` is a list. If the length of `nodes[key]` is exactly one, then `ends` is a list with an additional element `key`. Otherwise, no change is made to `ends`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `nodes[key]` is a list, and `ends` is a list with an additional element `key` if the length of `nodes[key]` is exactly one.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `nodes[key]` is a list, and `ends` is a list with an additional element `key`, regardless of the length of `nodes[key]`. If the length of `nodes[key]` is exactly one, `ends` already has the element `key`; otherwise, the condition remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
