Output State: **`prev` is now equal to `curr`, `curr` is the second element of `nodes[s]`, and `tree` contains the elements `s`, `curr`, and the new element added which is `nodes[curr][0]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `curr` to be the second element of `nodes[curr]`. Since `curr` was previously set to be the first element of `nodes[s]`, and `prev` is now equal to `curr`, `prev` also gets updated to the first element of `nodes[s]`. The variable `tree` remains unchanged except for the addition of `nodes[curr][0]`, which is the same as before since the only change is in the value of `curr`.
