Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be at least 3, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `nodes[u]` now includes `v`.**

Explanation: The code `nodes[u].append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `nodes[u]`. Before the code execution, `u` was assigned the value of the first integer input, and `v` was assigned the value of the second integer input. Therefore, after the code execution, `nodes[u]` will include `v`. All other variables remain unchanged.
