Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 3, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `nodes[u]` now includes `v`.**

Explanation: The code `nodes[u].append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `nodes[u]`. Initially, `u` is assigned the value of the first integer input, and `v` is assigned the value of the second integer input. This means `nodes[u]` will now include `v`. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `u`, and `v`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
