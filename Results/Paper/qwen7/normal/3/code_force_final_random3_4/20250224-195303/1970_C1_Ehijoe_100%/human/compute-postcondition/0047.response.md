Output State: **`prev` is equal to `curr`, `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the list `ends`, respectively; `tree` is a list containing the elements `s` and the new value of `curr`; the new value of `curr` is the first element of `nodes[old curr]` and must not be equal to `e`; `tree` has been appended with the new value of `curr`. Additionally, `nodes[new curr][0]` is not equal to `prev`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `curr` to be the first element of `nodes[curr]`. Since `curr` was previously equal to `old curr`, the new value of `curr` is now the first element of `nodes[old curr]`. All other conditions and relationships remain unchanged.
