Output State: **`prev` is equal to `curr`, `tree` contains the elements `s`, `curr`, and `curr` is the first element of `nodes[prev]` that is not equal to `e`.**

Explanation: The code `prev = curr` updates the value of `prev` to be the same as `curr`. The other variables (`tree`, `s`, `nodes`, and `e`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
