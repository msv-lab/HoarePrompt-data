Output State: `prev` is equal to `curr`, `tree` contains all elements from `s` to `e`, and `curr` is equal to `e`.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `curr` will eventually become equal to `e` because the loop continues to iterate as long as `curr` is not equal to `e`. The variable `prev` will always be equal to `curr` at the end of each iteration since the condition `prev == curr` is checked at the beginning of the loop and the loop continues to run until `curr` becomes `e`. Therefore, once `curr` equals `e`, `prev` will also be equal to `e`. The list `tree` will contain all the nodes traversed from `s` to `e`, forming a path in the graph represented by the `nodes` dictionary.
