Output State: **`prev` is equal to `curr`, `tree` contains the elements `s`, `curr`, and `curr` is the first element of `nodes[prev]` that is not equal to `e`.**

Explanation: The code `tree.append(curr)` appends the current value of `curr` to the list `tree`. Since `prev` is equal to `curr`, and `curr` is the first element of `nodes[prev]` that is not equal to `e`, these conditions remain true for the next iteration. The updated list `tree` now includes both `s` and the new value of `curr`.
