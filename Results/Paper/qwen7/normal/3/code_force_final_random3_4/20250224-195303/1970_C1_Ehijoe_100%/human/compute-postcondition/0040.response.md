Postcondition: `ends` is a list of all keys from the dictionary `nodes` whose corresponding value lists have a length of exactly one; `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the list `ends`, respectively; `tree` is a list containing the elements `s`, `curr`, and the new element added which is `nodes[curr][0]` (since `nodes[curr][0] == prev`); `prev` is now equal to `curr`; `curr` is the first element of `nodes[s]` and must not be equal to `e`.
