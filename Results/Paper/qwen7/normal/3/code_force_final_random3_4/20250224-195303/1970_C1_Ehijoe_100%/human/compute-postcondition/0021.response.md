Output State: **`nodes[key]' is a list with exactly one element; `ends` is a list with an additional element `key`.**

Explanation: The code appends `key` to the list `ends`. Initially, `nodes[key]` is a list with exactly one element, and the length of `nodes[key]` is 1. After executing the code, `ends` now contains an additional element `key`. The initial state of `nodes[key]` remains unchanged.
