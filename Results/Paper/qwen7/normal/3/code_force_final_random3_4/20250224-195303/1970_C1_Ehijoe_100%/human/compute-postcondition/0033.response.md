Output State: The variable `ends` will contain a list of all keys from the dictionary `nodes` whose corresponding value lists (i.e., `nodes[key]`) have a length of exactly one. The variable `nodes[key]` remains unchanged after the loop completes. The variable `i` starts at `n-2` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches -1 (assuming `i` is decremented within the loop or elsewhere in the code), but its final state is not relevant to the output state of `ends`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `ends` will include every key from `nodes` that points to a list containing exactly one element.
