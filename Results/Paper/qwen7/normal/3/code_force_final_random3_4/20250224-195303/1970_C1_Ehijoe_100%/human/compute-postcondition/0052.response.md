Output State: **`prev` is equal to `curr`, `tree` contains the elements `s`, `curr`, and `curr` is the second element of `nodes[curr]` that is not equal to `e`.**

Explanation: The code `curr = nodes[curr][1]` updates the value of `curr` to be the second element of the list `nodes[curr]` that is not equal to `e`. The initial state tells us that `curr` is the first element of `nodes[prev]` that is not equal to `e`. After executing the code, `curr` now points to the second such element in `nodes[curr]`. All other variables and their relationships remain unchanged.
