Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It verifies that certain conditions are met for variables n, t, u, v, and a list containing exactly one integer. Specifically, n is an integer within the range 2 to 2 Ã— 10^5, t is always 1, u and v are integers within the range 1 to n, and the list of starting nodes contains exactly one integer within the range 1 to n. The function returns whether these conditions are satisfied.**
