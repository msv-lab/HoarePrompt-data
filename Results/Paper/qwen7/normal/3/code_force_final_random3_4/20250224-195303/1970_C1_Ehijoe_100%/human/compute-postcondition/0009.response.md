Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be at least 3, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `nodes[v]` now includes `u`, `u` is assigned the value of the first integer input, `v` is assigned the value of the second integer input.**

This means that the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged. The variables `u` and `v` are updated to the values of the two integers entered by the user, and `nodes[v]` now includes `u`.
