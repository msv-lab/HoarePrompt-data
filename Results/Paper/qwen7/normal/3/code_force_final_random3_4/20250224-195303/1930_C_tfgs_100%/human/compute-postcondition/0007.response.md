Output State: **`i` is 2; `a[2]` is `a[2] + 3`**

Explanation: The code `a[i] += i + 1` increments the value of `a[i]` by `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 2, the expression becomes `a[2] += 2 + 1`, which simplifies to `a[2] += 3`. Therefore, the value of `a[2]` is updated by adding 3 to its current value. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it was initially set to 2.
