Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `i` and `a`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cur` is decreased by `adv` plus the value of `counter[a[i]]`.
   - `cnt` is reduced by `adv`.
   - `counter[a[i]]` is decremented by 1.
   - `adv` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is within the range `[1, len(a) - 1]`.
   - `a` is a list of unique elements sorted in descending order.
   - `cnt` is `n - len(a)`.
   - `ans` now includes `a[i]` appended to it.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 because the loop will continue if `i` is within the range `[1, len(a) - 1]`.
   - Since `i` was within the range `[1, len(a) - 1]` at the end of the previous iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `a` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop head.
   - `adv` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop head.
   - `counter[a[i]]` will be decremented by 1, but since `i` is increasing, we need to consider the new value of `a[i]` which is `a[i+1]`.

4. **Update the states**:
   - `cur` will be updated based on the new value of `a[i+1]`.
   - `cnt` will be updated based on the new value of `a[i+1]`.
   - `counter[a[i+1]]` will be decremented by 1.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `counter[a[i+1]]` is decremented by 1.
- `cur` and `cnt` will be updated based on the new value of `a[i+1]`.

Since the exact values of `cur` and `cnt` depend on the specific values of `adv` and `counter[a[i+1]]`, we can represent them symbolically.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cur` is decreased by `adv` plus the value of `counter[a[i+1]]`, `cnt` is reduced by `adv`, `counter[a[i+1]]` is decremented by 1, `adv` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `a` is a list of unique elements sorted in descending order, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, and `ans` now includes `a[i+1]` appended to it.**
