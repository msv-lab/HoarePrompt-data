Output State: **`cnt` must be greater than 0; `ans` is a list where the last element is now equal to the second last element minus 1.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of the last element of the list `ans` minus 1 to the list `ans`. Since the last element of `ans` was already decreased by 1 before this operation, appending this new value to the list means the last element of `ans` is now equal to the second last element minus 1. The precondition that `cnt` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
