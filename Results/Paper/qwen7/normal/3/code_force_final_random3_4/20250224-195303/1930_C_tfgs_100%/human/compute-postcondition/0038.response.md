Output State: **`cur` is decreased by `adv` plus the value of `counter[a[i+1]]`, `cnt` is reduced by `adv`, `counter[a[i+1]]` is decremented by 1, `adv` is equal to `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`, `i` is `i + 1`, `a` is a list of unique elements sorted in descending order, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `ans` now includes `a[i+1]` and `a[i-1] - 1 - 1` appended to it, `j` is 2.**

Explanation: The code appends `a[i - 1] - j - 1` to `ans`. Given that initially `j` was 1, after executing this line, `j` is updated to 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states as described in the initial state.
