Output State: **`j` is `adv - 1`, `ans` now contains `[a[i - 1] - j - 1, a[i - 1] - j - 1]`**

Explanation: The code appends the value `a[i - 1] - j - 1` to the list `ans`. Initially, `ans` contains `[a[i - 1] - j - 1]`. After appending the same value again, `ans` now contains two instances of `a[i - 1] - j - 1`. The value of `j` remains unchanged as it was initially set to `adv - 1`.
