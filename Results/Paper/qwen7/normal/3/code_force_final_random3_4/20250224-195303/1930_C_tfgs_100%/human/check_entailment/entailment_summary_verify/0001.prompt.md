You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Stack has an array a of length n . He also has an empty set S . Note that S is
not a multiset.

He will do the following three-step operation exactly n times:

  1. Select an index i such that 1 \leq i \leq |a| . 
  2. Insert^\dagger a_i + i into S . 
  3. Delete a_i from a . Note that the indices of all elements to the right of a_i will decrease by 1 . 

Note that after n operations, a will be empty.

Stack will now construct a new array b which is S sorted in decreasing order.
Formally, b is an array of size |S| where b_i is the i -th largest element of
S for all 1 \leq i \leq |S| .

Find the lexicographically largest^\ddagger b that Stack can make.

^\dagger A set can only contain unique elements. Inserting an element that is
already present in a set will not change the elements of the set.

^\ddagger An array p is lexicographically larger than a sequence q if and only
if one of the following holds:

  * q is a prefix of p , but p \ne q ; or 
  * in the first position where p and q differ, the array p has a larger element than the corresponding element in q . 

Note that [3,1,4,1,5] is lexicographically larger than [3,1,3] , [\,] , and
[3,1,4,1] but not [3,1,4,1,5,9] , [3,1,4,1,5] , and [4] .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{n} (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of array a .

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically largest b .

Example

Input

    3
    
    2
    
    2 1
    
    5
    
    1 100 1000 1000000 1000000000
    
    3
    
    6 4 8

Output

    3 2 
    1000000005 1000004 1003 102 2 
    11 7 6 
    
Note

In the first test case, select i=1 in the first operation, insert a_1 + 1 = 3
in S , and delete a_1 from a . After the first operation, a becomes a=[1] . In
the second operation, we select i=1 again and insert a_1 + 1 = 2 in S . Thus
S=\\{2, 3\\} , and b = [3, 2] .

Note that if you select i=2 in the first operation, and i=1 in the second
operation, S=\\{3\\} as 3 will be inserted twice, resulting in b=[3] .

As [3,2] is lexicographically larger than [3] , we should select i=1 in the
first operation.

In the second test case, in each operation, select the last element.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
    counter = Counter(a)
    cur = 0
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            cur -= adv
        ans.append(a[i])
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
        cur += counter[a[i]]
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
    print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a list of integers `a` for each test case. It first increments each element in the list by its index plus one. Then, it creates a frequency counter for the list, removes duplicates, sorts the list in descending order, and calculates the number of unique elements. It constructs a new list `ans` by appending elements based on certain conditions and performing cumulative decrements. Finally, it prints the resulting list `ans`, which contains the cumulative decremented values of the original list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the problem requirements.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Setting Up:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Modifying Array Elements:**
   - Each element `a[i]` is modified by adding `i + 1` to it. This ensures that each insertion into the set `S` is unique because of the added index value.

3. **Creating Set and Counting Elements:**
   - The program creates a set from the modified array `a`, ensuring uniqueness.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each element in the original array `a`.

4. **Sorting and Constructing Result Array `b`:**
   - The set `a` is sorted in reverse order to get the largest elements first.
   - The program then constructs the result array `ans` by considering the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted set.
   - It handles the remaining elements by appending the last element minus one for the remaining positions.

5. **Ensuring Lexicographical Order:**
   - The program aims to maximize the lexicographical order of the final array `b` by carefully constructing `ans` with the largest possible values while respecting the constraints.

### Verification Against Problem Requirements

1. **Unique Insertions:**
   - The program correctly modifies each element by adding its index, ensuring that each insertion into the set `S` is unique.

2. **Sorting and Construction:**
   - The program sorts the set in reverse order and constructs the result array `ans` by considering the differences between consecutive elements. This approach ensures that the largest possible values are used first, which aligns with the goal of maximizing the lexicographical order.

3. **Handling Remaining Elements:**
   - The program correctly handles any remaining elements by appending the last element minus one for the remaining positions, ensuring that the array is fully constructed.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the logic to generate the lexicographically largest array `b` based on the given problem description. It ensures unique insertions, sorts the elements correctly, and handles the remaining elements appropriately.
