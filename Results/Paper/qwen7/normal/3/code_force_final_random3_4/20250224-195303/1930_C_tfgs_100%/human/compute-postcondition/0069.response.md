Output State: **`cnt` must be greater than 0; `ans` is a list where the last element is decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)` appends a new element to the list `ans`. This new element is the last element of `ans` (which is `ans[-1]`) decremented by 1. Since the initial state only mentions that `cnt` must be greater than 0, and no other changes are made to `cnt`, it remains unchanged. The state of `ans` is updated according to the operation performed.
