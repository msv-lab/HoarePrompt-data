Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `j`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `adv`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `j`**: Since the loop starts with `j = 0` (as is typical for Python's `range` function), we need to ensure that `j` can increment and still be less than `adv` for at least one iteration.

3. **Determine the Value of `adv`**: The value of `adv` is given as `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`. This means `adv` is a non-negative integer determined by the values of `a[i - 1]`, `a[i]`, `cnt`, and `cur`.

4. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**: For the loop to execute at least once, `adv` must be greater than 0. If `adv` is 0, the loop will not execute at all.

5. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that `j` starts from 0 and can increment to be less than `adv` for at least one iteration. Therefore, `adv` must be greater than 0.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `adv` must be greater than 0.
- `j` starts from 0.

Since `j` starts from 0 and we need to ensure that the loop can execute at least once, the key adjustment is ensuring `adv` is greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cur` is decreased by `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)`, `adv` must be greater than 0, `i` is within the range `[1, len(a) - 1]`, `a` is a list of unique elements sorted in descending order, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each element in the new list `a`, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `ans` is an empty list, `j` is 0**
