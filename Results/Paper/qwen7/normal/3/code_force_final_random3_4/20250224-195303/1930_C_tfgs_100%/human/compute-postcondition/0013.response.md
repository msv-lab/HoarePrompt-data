Output State: **`cur` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is a list of unique elements sorted in descending order, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each element in the new list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `a` in descending order. The values of `cur` and `i` remain unchanged, and `a` is updated to be sorted in reverse order. The `counter` object, which counts the occurrences of each element in the list `a`, remains unaffected by the sorting operation.
