Output State: The value of `i` is `n-1`; for every index `j` in the list `a` where `0 â‰¤ j < n`, the value of `a[j]` is `j + (j + 1)`, which simplifies to `2j + 1`.

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`. Each element `a[j]` in the list `a` (where `j` ranges from `0` to `n-1`) will have been incremented by `j + 1` for each iteration it was within the loop's range. Therefore, the final value of each element `a[j]` will be `2j + 1`.
