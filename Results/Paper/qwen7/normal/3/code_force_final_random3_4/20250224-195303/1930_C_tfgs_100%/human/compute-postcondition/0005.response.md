Output State: **`i` is 1; `a[1]` is 2**

Explanation: The code `a[i] += i + 1` increments the value of `a[i]` by `i + 1`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `a[i]` which is `a[1]` is incremented by `1 + 1`, resulting in `a[1]` being 2. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1, and no other variables are affected.
