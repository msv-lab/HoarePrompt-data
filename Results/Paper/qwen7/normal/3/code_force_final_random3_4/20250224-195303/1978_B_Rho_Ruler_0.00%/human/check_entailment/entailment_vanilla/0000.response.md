Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Binary Search Setup**:
   - The program sets up a binary search with `low` initialized to 0 and `high` initialized to `n`.
   - It aims to find the maximum value of `k` such that the profit condition is satisfied.

3. **Binary Search Loop**:
   - The loop runs as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
   - Inside the loop, it calculates `mid` as the midpoint between `low` and `high`.
   - It calls `func_1(mid, a, b, n)` to check if the current `mid` value satisfies the profit condition.
   - If `func_1(mid, a, b, n)` returns `True`, it means the current `mid` value is feasible, so it updates `ans` to `mid` and moves the `low` boundary to `mid + 1`.
   - If `func_1(mid, a, b, n)` returns `False`, it means the current `mid` value is not feasible, so it moves the `high` boundary to `mid - 1`.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the total profit for a given `k`.
   - It adds `k * b` for the first `k` buns sold at the modified price.
   - It adds `(n - k) * a` for the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price.
   - It returns `True` if the total profit is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`, otherwise `False`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Profit Condition Check**:
   - The condition `ans <= n * max(a, b)` in `func_1` is incorrect. The goal is to maximize the profit, not to ensure the profit is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`.
   - The correct condition should be `ans >= n * min(a, b)` to ensure the profit is maximized.

2. **Return Value of `func_1`**:
   - The function should return `True` if the profit is greater than or equal to the threshold, and `False` otherwise.

### Corrected Program

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        low = 0
        high = n
        ans = -1
        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            if func_1(mid, a, b, n):
                ans = mid
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid - 1
        print(ans)

def func_1(k, a, b, n):
    ans = 0
    ans += k * b
    ans += (n - k) * a
    return ans >= n * min(a, b)
```

### Conclusion

The original program has an incorrect profit condition check in `func_1`. The corrected program uses the correct condition to maximize the profit.

**Correctness: False**
