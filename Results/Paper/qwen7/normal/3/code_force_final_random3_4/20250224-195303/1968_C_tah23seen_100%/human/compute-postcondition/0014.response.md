Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of n-1 integers, and `n`, which is the length of the list `arr` plus one. The function returns a list `ans` of length `n`. The last element `ans[n-2]` is `10^9 - arr[n-2]`, and each preceding element `ans[i]` (for i ranging from n-3 to 0) is calculated as `ans[i+1] - arr[i]`.**

This means the function takes a list of integers and an integer representing the length of the list plus one. It then constructs a new list where the last element is derived from subtracting the second-to-last element of the input list from `10^9`. Each preceding element in the new list is calculated by subtracting the corresponding element from the input list from the next element in the new list.
