Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, `ans` is a list of n elements where each element is 10^9 except `ans[n-2]` which is `ans[n-1] - arr[n-2]`, `i` is n - 5, `ans[i]` is `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`**.

Explanation: The variable `i` was decremented by 1, changing its value from `n - 4` to `n - 5`. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
