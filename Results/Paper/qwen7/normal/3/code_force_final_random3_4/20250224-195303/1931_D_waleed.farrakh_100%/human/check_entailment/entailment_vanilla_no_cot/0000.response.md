To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze both `func_1` and `func_2`. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Analysis of `func_1`

1. **Initialization**:
   - `results` list to store the results for each test case.
   - `freq` dictionary to keep track of the frequency of `(a % x, a % y)` pairs.

2. **Loop through the array**:
   - For each element `a` in the array:
     - Compute `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` and `ry = a % y`.
     - Check if the pair `(rx, ry)` exists in `freq`. If it does, add its frequency to `count`.
     - Update the frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` in `freq`.

3. **Return the results**:
   - Append the `count` to `results` for each test case.

### Analysis of `func_2`

1. **Reading Input**:
   - Read all lines from standard input using `sys.stdin.read`.
   - Split the lines into a list of strings.
   - Extract the number of test cases `t`.

2. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - Loop through each test case:
     - Extract `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr` for each test case.
     - Append the tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` to `test_cases`.

3. **Calling `func_1`**:
   - Call `func_1` with `test_cases` and store the results.

4. **Printing Results**:
   - Print each result in `results`.

### Correctness Verification

1. **Algorithm Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly counts the number of beautiful pairs by leveraging the properties of modular arithmetic.
   - The approach of using a frequency dictionary to count pairs is sound and efficient.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_2` correctly reads and processes the input according to the problem statement.
   - It handles multiple test cases efficiently by reading all input at once and processing them in a loop.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles edge cases such as large values of `n` and `x, y` within the specified limits.
   - The use of modulo operations ensures that negative remainders are handled correctly.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution for the given problem. Both functions handle the input and logic as required, and there are no apparent errors or inefficiencies.

**Correctness: True**
