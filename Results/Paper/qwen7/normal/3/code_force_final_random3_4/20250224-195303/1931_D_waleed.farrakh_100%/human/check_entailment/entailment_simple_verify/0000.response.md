### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code to ensure the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `freq` is a dictionary used to store the frequency of pairs \((a \% x, a \% y)\).
   - `count` is initialized to 0 and will store the number of beautiful pairs found.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - For each element `a` in the array `arr`:
     - Compute `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` and `ry = a % y`.
     - Check if the pair \((rx, ry)\) exists in `freq`. If it does, add the frequency of this pair to `count`.
     - Compute the current pair \((a \% x, a \% y)\) and update its frequency in `freq`.

3. **Return Statement**:
   - After processing all elements in `arr`, append the `count` to `results` and return `results`.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - Reads the entire input from standard input and splits it into lines.
   - Extracts the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.

2. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - For each test case, constructs a tuple \((n, x, y, arr)\) and appends it to `test_cases`.
   - Calls `func_1` with `test_cases` and stores the results.

3. **Output**:
   - Iterates through the results and prints each one.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
The annotated code correctly describes the state transitions and logic flow of the functions. However, there is a critical issue in the `func_1` function that affects the correctness of the solution.

### Critical Issue:
In the `func_1` function, the logic for checking beautiful pairs is flawed. Specifically, the condition for a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) being beautiful should involve both \(a_i + a_j\) being divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) being divisible by \(y\). However, the current implementation only checks the modulo conditions, which do not directly correspond to these divisibility conditions.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the pair \((a_i, a_j)\) satisfies both \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\) and \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\). This requires a different approach to count the pairs correctly.

### Corrected Approach:
1. **Count Pairs with \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\)**:
   - For each element \(a_i\), compute \(a_i \% x\) and store the count of each remainder in a dictionary.
   - For each element \(a_j\), compute \(a_j \% x\) and check if \((-a_j \% x + x) \% x\) exists in the dictionary. If it does, add the count to the result.

2. **Count Pairs with \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\)**:
   - Similarly, for each element \(a_i\), compute \(a_i \% y\) and store the count of each remainder in a dictionary.
   - For each element \(a_j\), compute \(a_j \% y\) and check if \((a_j \% y)\) exists in the dictionary. If it does, add the count to the result.

3. **Combine Results**:
   - Ensure that both conditions are satisfied simultaneously for each pair.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is **inaccurate** because the provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to find beautiful pairs. The current implementation only checks modulo conditions, which do not guarantee that the pairs satisfy the required divisibility conditions.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in the `func_1` function.
