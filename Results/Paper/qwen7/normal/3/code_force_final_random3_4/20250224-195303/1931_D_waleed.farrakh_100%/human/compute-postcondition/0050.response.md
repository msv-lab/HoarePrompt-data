Output State: **`count` is `freq[rx, ry]`, `n` is the first element of the new first tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the new first tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the new first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is a list with at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary, `current_pair` is the last unique pair processed in `arr`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count`, `ry` is `a % y`.**

Explanation: The line `count += freq[rx, ry]` increments the value of `count` by the value of `freq[rx, ry]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
