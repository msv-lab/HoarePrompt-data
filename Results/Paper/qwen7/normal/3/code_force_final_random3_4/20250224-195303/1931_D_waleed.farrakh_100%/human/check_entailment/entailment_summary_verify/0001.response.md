### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the provided function summaries.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis

1. **Initialization and Input Processing**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list of test cases as input.
   - It initializes an empty dictionary `freq` to store the frequency of pairs \((a \% x, a \% y)\).
   - It also initializes a counter `count` to keep track of the number of beautiful pairs.

2. **Processing Each Element in the Array**:
   - For each element `a` in the array, it calculates the remainders `rx` and `ry`:
     - `rx = (-a % x + x) % x`: This ensures that `rx` is always non-negative.
     - `ry = a % y`: This directly computes the remainder when `a` is divided by `y`.
   - It checks if the pair \((rx, ry)\) exists in the frequency dictionary `freq`. If it does, it adds the count of this pair to `count`.
   - It updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair \((a \% x, a \% y)\).

3. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns a list of counts for each test case.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` to get the results.
   - It reads the total number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it extracts `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`, and appends them to `test_cases`.

2. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - After processing all test cases, it calls `func_1` and prints the results.

#### Verification Against Problem Description

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by reading input from stdin and splitting it into individual test cases.

2. **Computation of Beautiful Pairs**:
   - The logic for determining beautiful pairs is correct. A pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is considered beautiful if:
     - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by `x`.
     - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by `y`.
   - The program uses modular arithmetic to efficiently check these conditions:
     - \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\) translates to \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\).
     - \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\) translates to \(a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y}\).

3. **Frequency Dictionary Usage**:
   - The frequency dictionary `freq` is used to count occurrences of pairs \((a \% x, a \% y)\). This helps in quickly finding pairs that satisfy the conditions for being beautiful.

4. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the number of beautiful pairs for each test case correctly.

#### Conclusion

After reviewing the program, it appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. There are no apparent errors in the code that would lead to incorrect results based on the problem constraints.
