Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Loop Head Variables:**
   - The loop head is defined as `for result in results:`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `result` and `results`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements in the `results` list.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `results` must contain at least zero elements.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must still contain at least one element.
   - `result` will be the next element in the list `results`.

### Adjusted States:

- **`results`**: Must contain at least one element (since the loop needs to execute one more time).
- **`result`**: Will be the first element in the updated `results` list.

### Final State:

State: **`results` must contain at least one element, and `result` will be the first element in the list**.
