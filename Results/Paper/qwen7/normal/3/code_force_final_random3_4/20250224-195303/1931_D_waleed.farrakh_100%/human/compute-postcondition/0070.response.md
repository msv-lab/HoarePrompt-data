Postcondition: **`arr` is a list with at least two elements, `count` is incremented by 1 if `current_pair` is not in `freq`, otherwise `count` is incremented by the value of `freq[current_pair]` and then 1. `n` is the first element of the new first tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the new first tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the new first tuple in `test_cases`, `ry` is `a % y`, `current_pair` is `a % x, a % y`, `freq` is a dictionary where the key `(-a % x + x) % x` is set to either `freq[(-a % x + x) % x] + 1` or 1.**
