You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n (an integer representing the size of the array), x and y (two integers representing Polycarp's favorite integers), and arr (a list of integers representing the elements of the array). Each element in arr is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        freq = {}
        
        count = 0
        
        for a in arr:
            rx = (-a % x + x) % x
            ry = a % y
            if (rx, ry) in freq:
                count += freq[rx, ry]
            current_pair = a % x, a % y
            if current_pair in freq:
                freq[current_pair] += 1
            else:
                freq[current_pair] = 1
        
        results.append(count)
        
    #State: `test_cases` is an empty list, `n` is undefined, `x` is undefined, `y` is undefined, `arr` is an empty list, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `count` is 0, and `results` is a list containing the sum of counts from each iteration of the loop.
    return results
    #The program returns an empty list for `results` since no iterations were performed and `results` was initialized as an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains four elements: `n` (an integer representing the size of the array), `x` and `y` (two integers representing Polycarp's favorite integers), and `arr` (a list of integers representing the elements of the array). After processing all tuples in `test_cases`, the function returns an empty list since no iterations were performed and `results` was initialized as an empty list.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns an empty list for `results` since no iterations were performed and `results` was initialized as an empty list.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
