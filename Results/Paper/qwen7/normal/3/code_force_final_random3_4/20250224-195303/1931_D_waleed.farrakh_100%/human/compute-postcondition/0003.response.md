Output State: **`test_cases` is an empty list, `t` is the first integer from the list `data[0]`, `data` is a list of strings, each string containing space-separated integers.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `test_cases`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was initially set to the first integer from the list `data[0]`. The variable `data` remains a list of strings, each containing space-separated integers.
