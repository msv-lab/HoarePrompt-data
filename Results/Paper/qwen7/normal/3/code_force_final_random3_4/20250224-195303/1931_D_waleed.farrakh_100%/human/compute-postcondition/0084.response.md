Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over the `test_cases` list, where each element is a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `n`, `x`, and `y` are the first, second, and third elements of the current tuple in `test_cases`.
   - `arr` is the fourth element of the current tuple in `test_cases`.

4. **Adjust the states based on the loop head variables**:
   - `n`, `x`, and `y` will be updated to the next tuple in `test_cases`.
   - `arr` will be updated to the new `arr` from the next tuple in `test_cases`.

5. **Initial state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `arr` contains all elements from `test_cases`.
   - `freq` is a dictionary mapping pairs `(a % x, a % y)` to their frequencies.
   - `current_pair` is the last unique pair processed in `arr`.
   - `count` is the sum of the values associated with the pairs `(rx, ry)` in `freq`, plus 1 for each unique pair encountered during the loop.
   - `n`, `x`, and `y` are the first, second, and third elements of the last tuple in `test_cases`, respectively.
   - `results` is a list containing the final value of `count`.

6. **State at the start of the next iteration**:
   - The next tuple in `test_cases` will be used to update `n`, `x`, and `y`.
   - `arr` will be set to the fourth element of the next tuple in `test_cases`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `n` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`.
- `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`.
- `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`.
- `arr` is the fourth element of the next tuple in `test_cases`.

Since the other variables (`freq`, `current_pair`, `count`, and `results`) are not part of the loop head, they remain unchanged.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` is the first element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the next tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the fourth element of the next tuple in `test_cases`**
