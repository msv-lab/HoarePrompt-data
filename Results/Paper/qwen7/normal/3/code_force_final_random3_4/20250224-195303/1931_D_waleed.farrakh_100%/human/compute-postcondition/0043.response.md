Output State: **`test_cases` is a non-empty list of tuples (with one fewer tuple), `n` is the first element of the new first tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the new first tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the new first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is an empty list, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `count` is the sum of the frequencies of pairs `(rx, ry)` found in `freq`, where `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x` and `ry` is `a % y`, `current_pair` is the last unique pair processed in `arr`, and `results` is a list containing the final value of `count`.**

Explanation: The line `freq = {}` initializes an empty dictionary named `freq`. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `count`, `current_pair`, and `results` remain unchanged from their initial states.
