Output State: **The loop will have executed 5 times since there are 5 tuples in `test_cases`. The `results` list will be fully iterated, and `result` will be the last element in the `results` list after the loop completes.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, `results` will have been fully processed, and `result` will hold the value of the last element that was printed during the loop's execution.
