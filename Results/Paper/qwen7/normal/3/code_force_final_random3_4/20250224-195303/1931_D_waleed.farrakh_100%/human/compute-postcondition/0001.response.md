Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `data` is a list of strings, each string containing space-separated integers.**

Explanation: The code `data = input().splitlines()` reads a single line from the input (which is a string containing multiple space-separated integers) and splits it into a list of strings based on newline characters. Since there's no newline character in the example, it will treat the entire string as one element in the list. The variable `t` remains unchanged, so it is still an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The variable `data` is now a list where each element is a string containing the space-separated integers from the original input string.
