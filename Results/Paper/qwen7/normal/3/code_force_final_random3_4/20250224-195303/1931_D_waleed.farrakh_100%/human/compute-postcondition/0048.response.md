Postcondition: `n` is the first element of the new first tuple in `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of the new first tuple in `test_cases`, `y` is the third element of the new first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is a list with at least one element, `freq` is a dictionary, `count` is 0, `current_pair` is the last unique pair processed in `arr`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count`, `ry` is `a % y`, and the tuple `(rx, ry)` is already a key in the dictionary `freq`.
