Output State: **`i` is `l-1`, `x` is 0, `y` is 100000000, `e` is `t`, `l` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers created from user input.**

Explanation: The line `x = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `x`. All other variables (`i`, `y`, `e`, `l`, and `nums`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
