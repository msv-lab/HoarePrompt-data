Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `l`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 0 to `l-1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `l-1`.
3. **Determine the initial values**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.
   - `e` is 0.
   - `l` must be greater than 0.
   - `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces.
   - `x` is the maximum value between `x` (which is the value of `nums[i]`) and the previous value of `x`.
   - `y` is equal to `nums[i]` if `nums[i] < y`, otherwise `y` remains unchanged.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented at each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `l-1`, so `i` will be `i + 1` and it must still be less than `l`.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- `t` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `e` remains 0 as it is not affected by the loop.
- `l` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `nums` remains the same as it is not affected by the loop.
- `x` will be updated to the maximum value between `x` and `nums[i+1]`.
- `y` will be updated to `nums[i+1]` if `nums[i+1] < y`, otherwise `y` remains unchanged.

Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new state for `i` will be `i + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `e` is 0, `l` must be greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `x` is the maximum value between `x` and `nums[i+1]`, and `y` is equal to `nums[i+1]` if `nums[i+1] < y`, otherwise `y` remains unchanged.**
