Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `e` is 0, `l` must be greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `i` is 1, `y` is the integer at index 1 of `nums`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of the element at index `i` (which is `1`) of the list `nums` to the variable `y`. Since `i` is 1, `y` will take the value of the second element in the list `nums`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
