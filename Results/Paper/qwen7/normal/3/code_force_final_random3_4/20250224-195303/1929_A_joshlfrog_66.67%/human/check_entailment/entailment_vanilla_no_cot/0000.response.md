Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The logic in the program only finds the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array, which is not the correct approach to maximize the sum of differences as described in the problem statement.

To solve this problem correctly, you should sort the array and then calculate the beauty as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. Hereâ€™s how you can modify the function to achieve the correct result:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        nums = sorted([int(x) for x in input().split()])
        beauty = sum(nums[i] - nums[i-1] for i in range(1, l))
        print(beauty)
```

This modified function sorts the array and then calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements, which ensures the maximum possible beauty.
