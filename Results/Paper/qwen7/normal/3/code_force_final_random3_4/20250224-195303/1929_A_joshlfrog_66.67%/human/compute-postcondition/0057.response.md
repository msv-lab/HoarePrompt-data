Output State: **`i` is 2; `x` is `nums[2]`; `x` is the value at index 2 of the list `nums`.**

Explanation: The code `x = nums[i]` assigns the value at index `i` of the list `nums` to the variable `x`. Given that `i` is 2, `x` is now set to the value at index 2 of the list `nums`. The value of `i` remains unchanged.
