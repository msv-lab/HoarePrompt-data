Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive. No other variables are affected.**

This means that the variable `t` now holds the integer value entered by the user, constrained within the range of 1 to 500. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
