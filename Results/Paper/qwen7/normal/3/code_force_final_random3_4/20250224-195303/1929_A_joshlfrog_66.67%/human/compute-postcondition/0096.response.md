Based on the initial state provided:

- After the loop executes all iterations, `i` will be equal to `l`.
- `x` will hold the maximum value from the list `nums`.
- `y` will hold the minimum value from the list `nums`.
- The variable `e` remains `t`.
- `l` remains an input integer.
- `nums` is the list of integers created from user input.

The `print(x - y)` statement will print the difference between the maximum value (`x`) and the minimum value (`y`) from the list `nums`.

Output: **x - y (where x is the maximum value and y is the minimum value from the list nums)**
