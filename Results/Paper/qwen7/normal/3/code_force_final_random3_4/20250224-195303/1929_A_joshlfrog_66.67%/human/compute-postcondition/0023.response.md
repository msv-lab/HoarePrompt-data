Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(l)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `l`.

2. **Determine the initial state**: At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.
   - `e` is 0.
   - `l` must be greater than 0.
   - `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces.
   - If `nums[i] < y`, then `y` is equal to `nums[i]`; otherwise, `y` remains unchanged.

3. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `l-1`. In each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from `0` and increments by `1` in each iteration, after one iteration, `i` will be `1`.
   - The value of `l` does not change within the loop unless modified outside the loop, so it remains the same as the initial value of `l` at the start of the loop.

5. **Update the postconditions**:
   - `t` remains an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.
   - `e` remains 0.
   - `l` remains greater than 0.
   - `nums` remains a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces.
   - `y` remains unchanged unless `nums[i] < y` during the current iteration, but since we are considering the state before the next iteration, `y` remains as it was after the previous iteration.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `e` is 0, `l` must be greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, and `i` is 1**.
