Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `e` is 0, `l` is the length of the `nums` list, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `x` is the maximum value found in the `nums` list, and `y` is the minimum value found in the `nums` list.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `l` (the length of the `nums` list). The variable `x` will hold the maximum value found in the `nums` list during the loop's execution, and `y` will hold the minimum value found in the `nums` list. The other variables (`t`, `e`, and `l`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
