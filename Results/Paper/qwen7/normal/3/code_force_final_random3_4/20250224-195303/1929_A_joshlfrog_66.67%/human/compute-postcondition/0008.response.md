Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `e` is 0, `l` must be greater than 0, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces, `x` is the value of `nums[i]`, `y` is 100000000.**

The code assigns the value of `nums[i]` to `x`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
