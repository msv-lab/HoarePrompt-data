- `string` is an input string from the user.
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string.
- `n` is the length of the list `s`, which is currently 2.
- `done` is True.
- `x` is the first character of the list `s`.
- `s.count(x)` is equal to 1.
- The current value of `n` is odd.
- The middle element of `s` is not equal to `x`.

The print statement is `print('NO')`.
