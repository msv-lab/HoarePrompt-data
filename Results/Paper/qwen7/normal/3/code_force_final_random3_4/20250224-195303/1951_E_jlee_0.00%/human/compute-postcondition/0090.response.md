Postcondition: `j` is 0, `n` is 2, `s[0]` is not equal to `s[1]`, `done` is set to True, `count` is greater than 0, the current value of `s[j]` equals `x`, and either `count2` equals `count` (if `count` is greater than 1) or `count2` is greater than `count` (if `count` is not greater than 1). If `count2` is greater than `count`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
