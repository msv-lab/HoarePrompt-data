Postcondition: `j` is 0, `n` is 2, `s[0]` is not equal to `s[1]`, `done` is set to True, `count` is greater than 0, and the current value of `s[j]` either equals `x` or does not equal `x`. If `s[j]` does not equal `x`, then `count2` is a value greater than 0 but less than `count`. If `s[j]` equals `x`, then `count2` equals `count` (if `count` is greater than 1) or `count2` is greater than `count` (if `count` is not greater than 1), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
