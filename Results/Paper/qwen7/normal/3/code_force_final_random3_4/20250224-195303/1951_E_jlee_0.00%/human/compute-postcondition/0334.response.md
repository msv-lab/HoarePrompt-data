Output State: **`j` is 3, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True, `count` is 3, `count2` is 0.**

Explanation: The `continue` statement in the given code does not modify any variable's value or state. It simply skips the rest of the current iteration of the loop (if it was inside one) and moves to the next iteration. Since no changes were made to any variables, their states remain the same as the initial state.
