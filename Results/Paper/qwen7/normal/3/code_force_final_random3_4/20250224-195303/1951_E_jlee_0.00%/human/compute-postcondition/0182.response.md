Output State: **Postcondition: `j` is 1, `n` is 2, `done` is True, `count` is 1, and `count2` is 1.**

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `j` will be 1 because the loop iterates through the range `(n + 1) // 2`, and with `n` being 2, the loop runs twice, setting `j` to 1 in the last iteration. The variable `n` remains 2 as it is not modified within the loop. The variable `done` is set to True after the first iteration when the conditions inside the loop are met. The values of `count` and `count2` are both set to 1 based on the conditions described in the provided states after the first two iterations.
