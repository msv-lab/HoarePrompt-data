Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is 4.
- `n` is greater than 7.
- `count` is 4.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, then `done` is set to True and the loop or if statement is broken. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, the postcondition remains unchanged.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(string[:j], string[j:])`.

Given:
- `j` is 4, which means we need to consider the substring from the start of `string` up to index 4 (inclusive) and the substring from index 5 to the end of `string`.

Therefore, the output will be the concatenation of the two substrings described above.

Output: **string[:4], string[4:]**
