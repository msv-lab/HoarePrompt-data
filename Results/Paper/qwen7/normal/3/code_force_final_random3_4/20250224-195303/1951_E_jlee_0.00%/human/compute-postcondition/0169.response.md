Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is 2, `done` is set to True, and `count` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `done = True` simply reassigns the value of `done` to `True`. It does not affect the values of `j`, `n`, or `count`. Since the initial state of `done` was already `True`, this assignment does not change its value. The conditions for incrementing `count` are not met because the code snippet does not include those conditions, and no other operations are performed on `count`. Therefore, `count` remains unchanged.
