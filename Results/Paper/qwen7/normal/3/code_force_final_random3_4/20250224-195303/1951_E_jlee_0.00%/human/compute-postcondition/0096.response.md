Postcondition: `j` is 0, `n` is 2, `s[0]` is not equal to `s[1]`, `done` is set to True, `count` is greater than 0, and `count2` is either a value greater than 0 but less than `count` if `s[j]` does not equal `x`, or `count2` equals `count` (if `count` is greater than 1) or `count2` is greater than `count` (if `count` is not greater than 1) if `s[j]` equals `x`. Additionally, if `s[j]` equals `x`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
