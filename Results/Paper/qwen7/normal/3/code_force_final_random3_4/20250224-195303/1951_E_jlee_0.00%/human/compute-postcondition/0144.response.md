Given the initial state:
- `j` is 1
- `n` is 2
- `done` is set to `True`

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print(string)
```

Since there is no definition or assignment for the variable `string` in the provided initial state, and no way to infer its value from the given information, we cannot determine the exact string that will be printed.

Therefore, the output cannot be precisely determined based on the given information.

Output: **string (where string is an undefined variable)**
