Output State: **`done` is True, `count` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables `done` and `count`. It only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement that it is inside. Since the initial state shows that we are breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement, this state remains unchanged.
