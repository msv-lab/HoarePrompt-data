Output State: **`j` is 3, `n` is the length of the input string `s`, `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is False, `count` is 3, `count2` is 0, `i` is 4, and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of the program to skip the remaining part of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified by this statement, all the variables retain their previous values, and the loop continues.
