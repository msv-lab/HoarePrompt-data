Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True, `count` is greater than 0, the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count2` is 0, and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are updated or changed by the `continue` statement, the values of the variables remain the same as they were before the statement was executed.
