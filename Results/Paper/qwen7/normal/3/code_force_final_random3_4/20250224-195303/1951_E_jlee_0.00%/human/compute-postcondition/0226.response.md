Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True, `count` is 1, and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.**

Explanation: The code `count = j` assigns the value of `j` (which is 1) to the variable `count`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
