Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to the current value of `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

This output state indicates that the loop or conditional statement being executed has been broken out of, but the values of the other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
