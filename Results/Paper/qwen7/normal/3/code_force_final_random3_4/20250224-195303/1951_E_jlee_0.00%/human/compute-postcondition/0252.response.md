Postcondition: `j` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True, `count` is greater than 0, the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, and either `count2` is equal to `count` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or `count2` is 0 and we continue the loop.
