Output State: **`j` is 3, `n` is the length of the input string `s`, `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is False, `count` is 3, `count2` is 0, `i` is 4, `x` is `s[0]` and we continue the loop.**

The `continue` statement causes the flow of execution to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are updated or affected by this statement, all the variables retain their previous values, and the loop continues.
