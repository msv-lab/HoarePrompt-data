Postcondition: `j` is 1, `n` is 2, and `done` is True. If `s[j] != x` and `count < 1`, then `count` is incremented by 1. If `s[j] == x` or `count >= 1`, the values of `j`, `n`, `done`, `count`, and `count2` remain unchanged. If `count2` is greater than `count`, then `count` remains unchanged. If `count` is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `count` is 1 and `count2` is 1.
