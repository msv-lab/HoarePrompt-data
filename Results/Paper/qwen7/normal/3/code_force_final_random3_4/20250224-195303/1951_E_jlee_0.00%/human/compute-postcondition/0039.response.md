Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string from the user, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the length of the list `s` which is currently 2, `done` is True, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, and either `s.count(x)` is equal to 1 and the current value of `n` is odd with the middle element of `s` not equal to `x`, or `s.count(x)` is not equal to `n - 1`.
