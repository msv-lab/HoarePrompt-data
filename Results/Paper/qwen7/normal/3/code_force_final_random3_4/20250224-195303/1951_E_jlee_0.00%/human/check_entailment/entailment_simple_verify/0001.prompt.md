You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - It reads each string `string` for each test case.

2. **Single Character String Handling:**
   - If the string length `n` is 1, it directly prints "NO" because a single character cannot be split into non-palindromic substrings.

3. **Initial Checks:**
   - If the first character `x` is different from the last character, it prints "YES" and the entire string as a single non-palindromic substring.
   - If all characters are the same (`s.count(x) == n`), it prints "NO" because no non-palindromic substring can be formed.
   - If all characters except one are the same (`s.count(x) == n - 1`), it checks if the string has an odd length. If so, it prints "NO" because the middle character would make the string non-palindromic, but the rest would form a palindrome. Otherwise, it prints "YES" and the entire string as a single non-palindromic substring.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic iterates through the string to find the first non-matching pair of characters.
   - If such a pair is found, it prints "YES" and the entire string as a single non-palindromic substring.
   - If no such pair is found, it tries to split the string into two parts where at least one part is non-palindromic.
   - If no valid partition is found after these checks, it prints "NO".

### Issues Identified:
1. **Handling of Single Character Strings:**
   - The program correctly handles single-character strings by printing "NO".

2. **Handling of Strings with All Characters the Same:**
   - The program correctly handles strings with all characters the same by printing "NO".

3. **Handling of Strings with All Characters the Same Except One:**
   - The program correctly handles strings with all characters the same except one by printing "NO" if the string has an odd length.

4. **Main Logic for Finding Non-Palindromic Substrings:**
   - The main logic is flawed. It only checks for the first non-matching pair and does not consider other possible splits.
   - For example, the string "aab" should be split into ["a", "b"] or ["a", "a"], but the program does not handle this correctly.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases like strings with repeated patterns or more complex structures.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Specifically, it fails to handle cases where the string can be split into multiple non-palindromic substrings.

### Correctness:
**False**

A corrected version would need to properly handle all possible splits and ensure that the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings if possible.
