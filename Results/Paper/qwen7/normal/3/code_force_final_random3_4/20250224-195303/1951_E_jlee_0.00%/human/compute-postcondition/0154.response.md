Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is 1
- `n` is 2
- `done` is set to True

We need to determine the values of `string[:j]` and `string[j:]` when the print statement executes.

From the postcondition, we know:
- `j` is 1
- `n` is 2
- `done` is True

However, the postcondition does not directly give us the value of `string`. Since `string` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact content. But we can still describe the slicing operation based on the value of `j`.

Given `j` is 1, `string[:j]` will be the substring of `string` from the start up to but not including the index 1. This means it will be an empty string if `string` is non-empty.

`string[j:]` will be the substring of `string` starting from index 1 to the end of the string.

Since we don't have the actual value of `string`, we can only describe the slices in terms of `string`.

Output: **'' [empty string], string[1:]**
