Output State: **`j` is 0, `n` is 2, `s[0]` is not equal to `s[1]`, `done` is set to True, the current value of `s[j]` does not equal `x`, and `count2` is a value greater than 0 but less than `count`.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the loop or the most nested block it is within. In this case, since no loop or conditional block was specified, it simply breaks out of the context it was written in. None of the variables are modified by the `break` statement, so their previous states remain unchanged.
