Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program attempts to check if the string can be rearranged to form a palindrome by removing at most one character, which is not what the problem requires. The problem asks for a partition of the string into substrings such that none of these substrings are palindromes.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Logic**: The program tries to check if the string can be rearranged to form a palindrome by removing one or two characters. This is not relevant to the problem of partitioning the string into non-palindromic substrings.

2. **Partitioning Requirement**: The program should focus on finding a way to split the string into substrings where each substring is not a palindrome. It should not try to rearrange the string to avoid forming a palindrome.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, it does not correctly identify when a string can be split into non-palindromic substrings. It also fails to handle cases where the string itself is a palindrome or can be split in a way that satisfies the problem requirements.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
