Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is 2, `done` is set to True, `count` is unchanged, `count2` is 0**.

Explanation: The code initializes `count2` to 0. Since no other operations are performed on `count`, `j`, `n`, or `done`, their values remain unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, `j` is 1, `n` is 2, `done` is set to True, and `count` remains unchanged while `count2` is now 0.
