Output State: **`j` is 0, `n` is 2, `s[0]` is not equal to `s[1]`, `done` is set to True, `count` is greater than 0, `s[j]` equals `x`, `count2` is 0.**

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no variables are modified within the scope of the `continue` statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
