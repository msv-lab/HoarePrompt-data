Output State: **`j` is 3, `n` is at least 7, `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count` is greater than 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement is used to exit the most internal loop or if statement. It does not change the values of the variables `j`, `n`, `s[j]`, `x`, `count`, or `done`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous states, and the only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
