Based on the initial state described:

- `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers obtained from input.
- `i` is equal to `x`.
- `z` is yet to be calculated based on the given conditions.

However, the print statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Since no calculation involving `k`, `a`, `i`, or `z` is performed within the given code snippet, and the print statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
