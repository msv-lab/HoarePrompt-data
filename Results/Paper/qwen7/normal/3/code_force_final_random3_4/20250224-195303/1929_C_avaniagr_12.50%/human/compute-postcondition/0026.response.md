Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and `x`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `x + 1`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `x` must be a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
   - `z` is `z // (k - 1) + 1` (this value does not change within the loop and is not part of the loop head).

4. **Calculate the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `x + 1`. Since `i` is now 1, `x` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute again.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` will be 1.
   - `x` must still be a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
   - `z` remains unchanged and is not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 1, `x` must be a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `z` is `z // (k - 1) + 1`**
