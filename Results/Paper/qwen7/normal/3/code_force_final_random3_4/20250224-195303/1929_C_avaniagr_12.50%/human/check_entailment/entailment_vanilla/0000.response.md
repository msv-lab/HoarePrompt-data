### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.

2. **Conditions for Winning**:
   - The program checks the conditions for Sasha to win based on the values of `k` and `x`:
     - If `x < k - 1`: This means Sasha can recover from losing up to `x` times in a row without needing more than `x + 1` coins initially.
       - If `a >= x + 1`, Sasha can guarantee winning because he can cover the worst-case scenario of losing `x` times in a row and then winning.
       - Otherwise, Sasha cannot guarantee winning.
     - If `x == k - 1`: This means Sasha can recover from losing up to `x` times in a row without needing more than `x + 3` coins initially.
       - If `a >= x + 3`, Sasha can guarantee winning because he can cover the worst-case scenario of losing `x` times in a row and then winning.
       - Otherwise, Sasha cannot guarantee winning.
     - If `x > k - 1`: This means Sasha needs a more complex strategy to ensure he can recover from losing `x` times in a row.
       - The program calculates the minimum number of coins needed (`z`) using a loop that simulates the worst-case scenario of losing `x + 1` times in a row and then winning.
       - If `a >= z`, Sasha can guarantee winning.
       - Otherwise, Sasha cannot guarantee winning.

3. **Calculation of `z`**:
   - The loop in the program calculates the minimum number of coins needed to recover from losing `x + 1` times in a row and then winning.
   - The formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` ensures that Sasha can recover from the worst-case scenario of losing `x + 1` times in a row and then winning.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints 'YES' if Sasha can guarantee winning and 'NO' otherwise.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Sasha can guarantee winning based on the given constraints. The calculations and conditions are correctly applied, and the output matches the expected results in the provided examples.

### Correctness:

**True**
