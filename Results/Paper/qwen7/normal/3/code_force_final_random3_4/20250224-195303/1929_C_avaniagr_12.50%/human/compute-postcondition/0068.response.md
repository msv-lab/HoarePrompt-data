Postcondition: `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers obtained from input, `i` and `z` are yet to be calculated based on the given conditions. If `x < k - 1`, the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged, `i` remains equal to `x`, and `z` is still yet to be calculated based on the given conditions. Otherwise, `i` equals `2x + 1`, `z` equals `x + 1`, and `a` remains unchanged. If `x` equals `k - 1`, then `z` is set to `x + 1`.
