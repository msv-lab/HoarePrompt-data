Postcondition: **`k` is an integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` remains unchanged, `i` equals `2x + 1` if `x >= k - 1`, otherwise `i` equals `x`, `z` equals `x + 1` if `x >= k - 1`, otherwise `z` equals `x + 1`.** 

This postcondition remains the same as the precondition because neither the if part nor the else part changes the values of `k`, `x`, `a`, `i`, or `z`. The if and else parts simply restate the conditions under which `i` and `z` are assigned certain values, but these assignments do not alter the overall state described in the precondition.
