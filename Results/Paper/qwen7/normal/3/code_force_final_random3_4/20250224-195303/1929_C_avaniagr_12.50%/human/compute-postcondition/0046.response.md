Postcondition: `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers obtained from input, `i` is equal to `x`, and `z` is yet to be calculated based on the given conditions. Whether `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1` or not, the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged, `i` remains equal to `x`, and `z` is still yet to be calculated based on the given conditions.
