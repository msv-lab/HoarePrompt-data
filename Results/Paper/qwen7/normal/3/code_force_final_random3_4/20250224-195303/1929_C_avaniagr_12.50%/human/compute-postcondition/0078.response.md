Postcondition: **`k` is an integer, `x` is a non-negative integer, `a` remains unchanged, `i` equals `2x + 1` if `x >= k - 1`, otherwise `i` equals `x`, `z` equals `x + 1` if `x >= k - 1`, otherwise `z` equals `x + 1`.** 

This postcondition remains the same because both the if and else parts do not change the values of `k`, `x`, `a`, `i`, or `z`. The if condition only affects the assignment of `i` and `z` based on the value of `x` relative to `k - 1`, but since the else part has identical behavior, the overall postcondition does not change.
