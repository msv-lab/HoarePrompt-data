Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.
3. The logic in the program checks different conditions to determine if Sasha can guarantee winning any number of coins:
   - If `x < k - 1`, it checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`.
   - If `x == k - 1`, it checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`.
   - If `x > k - 1`, it calculates `z` using the formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` for `x + 1` iterations and then checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `z`.

4. The program prints 'YES' if Sasha can guarantee winning any number of coins and 'NO' otherwise.

5. The final state of the variables after the loop is consistent with the logic of the program. The value of `t` will be 0, and the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` will retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop. The variable `i` will be `2x + 1` if `x` was greater than or equal to `k - 1` during the last iteration, otherwise `i` will be `x`. The variable `z` will be the final calculated value based on the conditions met in the last iteration of the loop.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic appears to be correct and matches the requirements specified in the problem.

Correctness: **True**
