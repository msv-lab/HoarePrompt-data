Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `k` is an integer.
   - `x` is a non-negative integer.
   - `a` remains unchanged (though its value is not relevant to the print statement).
   - `i` is calculated based on the condition:
     - If `x >= k - 1`, then `i = 2x + 1`.
     - Otherwise, `i = x`.
   - `z` is calculated based on the same condition as `i`:
     - If `x >= k - 1`, then `z = x + 1`.
     - Otherwise, `z = x + 1`.

2. **Print Statement**:
   ```python
   print('NO')
   ```

The print statement directly outputs the string `'NO'` without referencing any variables. Therefore, regardless of the values of `k` and `x`, the print statement will always output the string `'NO'`.

Output: **'NO'**
