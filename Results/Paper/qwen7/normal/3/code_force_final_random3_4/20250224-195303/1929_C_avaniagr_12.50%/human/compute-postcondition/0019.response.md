Output: **NO**

Explanation: Based on the initial state, the variables `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` have specific constraints but their exact values are not provided. The print statement simply outputs the string 'NO', regardless of the values of the other variables. Since no other information is given about `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` that would affect the output of the print statement, the only thing that will be printed is the string 'NO'.
