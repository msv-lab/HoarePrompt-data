Output State: **`k`, `x`, and `a` are integers obtained from input, `i` is equal to `x`, and `z` is yet to be calculated based on the given conditions.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from input and assigns them to `k`, `x`, and `a` respectively. The variable `i` is then set to the value of `x`. The value of `z` is yet to be determined based on the subsequent operations, but according to the problem statement, `z` will be the result of adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` a total of `x + 1` times. However, since no further operations are performed in the given snippet, the initial values of the variables are updated as described.
