Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, and `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9; `k`, `x`, and `a` retain their original values. `x` will either remain less than `k - 1` or, if `x` equals `k - 1`, it will remain equal to `k - 1` under certain conditions involving `a`. Additionally, `i` will be equal to `x`, `x` must be a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and `z` will be the result of adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` a total of `x + 1` times. The function will return `a` if `a` is greater than or equal to `z`; otherwise, it will return `z`.
