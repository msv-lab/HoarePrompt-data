You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

            if a >= x + 1:
                print('YES')
            else:

    #State: After all iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `t` will be 0, as each iteration decreases `t` by 1 until it reaches 0. The values of `k`, `x`, and `a` will retain their final values from the last iteration of the loop. `i` will be equal to `2x + 1` if `x` was greater than or equal to `k - 1` during the last iteration, otherwise `i` will be equal to `x`. The variable `z` will be the final calculated value based on the conditions met in the last iteration of the loop. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, then `a` remains unchanged. If `a` is less than `z`, then `a` is updated to `z`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.

2. **Conditions for Winning**:
   - The program checks the conditions for Sasha to win based on the values of `k` and `x`:
     - If `x < k - 1`: This means Sasha can recover from losing up to `x` times in a row without needing more than `x + 1` coins initially.
       - If `a >= x + 1`, Sasha can guarantee winning because he can cover the worst-case scenario of losing `x` times in a row and then winning.
       - Otherwise, Sasha cannot guarantee winning.
     - If `x == k - 1`: This means Sasha can recover from losing up to `x` times in a row without needing more than `x + 3` coins initially.
       - If `a >= x + 3`, Sasha can guarantee winning because he can cover the worst-case scenario of losing `x` times in a row and then winning.
       - Otherwise, Sasha cannot guarantee winning.
     - If `x > k - 1`: This means Sasha needs a more complex strategy to ensure he can recover from losing `x` times in a row.
       - The program calculates the minimum number of coins needed (`z`) using a loop that simulates the worst-case scenario of losing `x + 1` times in a row and then winning.
       - If `a >= z`, Sasha can guarantee winning.
       - Otherwise, Sasha cannot guarantee winning.

3. **Calculation of `z`**:
   - The loop in the program calculates the minimum number of coins needed to recover from losing `x + 1` times in a row and then winning.
   - The formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` ensures that Sasha can recover from the worst-case scenario of losing `x + 1` times in a row and then winning.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints 'YES' if Sasha can guarantee winning and 'NO' otherwise.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Sasha can guarantee winning based on the given constraints. The calculations and conditions are correctly applied, and the output matches the expected results in the provided examples.

### Correctness:

**True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided examples.
