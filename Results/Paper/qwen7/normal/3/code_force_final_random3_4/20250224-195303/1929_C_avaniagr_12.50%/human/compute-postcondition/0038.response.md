Postcondition: `t` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, and `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9; `k`, `x`, and `a` retain their original values. Additionally, if `x` equals `k - 1` and `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, then `x` remains equal to `k - 1`. Otherwise, `x` is less than `k - 3`. Furthermore, `i` will be equal to `x`, `x` must be a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and `z` will be the result of adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` a total of `x + 1` times. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, the function returns `a`; otherwise, it returns `z`.
