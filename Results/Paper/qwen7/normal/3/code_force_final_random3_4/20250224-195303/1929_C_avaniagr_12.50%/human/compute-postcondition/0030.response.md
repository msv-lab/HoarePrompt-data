Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `x`, `x` must be a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and `z` will be the sum of `z // (k - 1) + 1` added `x + 1` times.

In simpler terms, `z` will be calculated as follows: Start with the initial value of `z`, then repeatedly add `z // (k - 1) + 1` for a total of `x + 1` times.
