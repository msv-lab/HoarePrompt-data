Postcondition: `d` is `k // 2`, `a` is a list of integers from the new input split, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from the input split, `b` is updated to a list of integers from the new input split, `len_a` is the length of list `a`, `len_b` is the length of list `b`, `count_a` is 2, `count_b` is either 3 or remains 2 (it will be 3 if `a[i] <= k` and 2 otherwise), `i` is incremented by 1, and `t` is 1.
