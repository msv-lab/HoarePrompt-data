Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes inputs through a series of constraints. It accepts a list of test cases, where each test case includes integers t, n, m, k, a (a list of n integers), and b (a list of m integers). The function returns different values based on the conditions specified for t, n, m, k, a, and b.**

Note: Although the function signature does not explicitly mention parameters, the description implies that the function processes a series of test cases with specific constraints for each test case.
