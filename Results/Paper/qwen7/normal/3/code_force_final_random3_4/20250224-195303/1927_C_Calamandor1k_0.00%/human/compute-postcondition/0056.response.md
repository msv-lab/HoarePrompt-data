Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(max(len_a, len_b))`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `max(len_a, len_b)`. Therefore, the loop will run based on the values of `len_a` and `len_b`.

3. **Adjust the Relevant States**:
   - `i`: This variable starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration. We don't need to set its initial value explicitly since it starts at 0.
   - `len_a`: This is the length of the list `a`.
   - `len_b`: This is the length of the list `b`.

4. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**: For the loop to execute at least once, `max(len_a, len_b)` must be at least 1.

Given the above points, the states that need to be adjusted are `len_a` and `len_b` such that their maximum value is at least 1.

**Final State**:
State: **`d` is `k // 2`, `a` is a list of integers from the input split, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from the input split, `b` is a list of integers from the new input split, `len_a` is the length of list `a` and must be at least 1, `len_b` is the length of list `b` and must be at least 1, `count_a` is 0, `count_b` is 0**
