Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a single line of input, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list named `a`. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
