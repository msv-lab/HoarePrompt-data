Postcondition: `d` is `k // 2`, `a` is a list of integers from the input split, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from the input split, `b` is a list of integers from the new input split, `len_a` is the length of list `a` and must be at least 1, `len_b` is the length of list `b` and must be at least 1, `count_a` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `a[i]` (where `i` is 1) is less than or equal to `k`, `count_b` is 1, `i` is 1.
