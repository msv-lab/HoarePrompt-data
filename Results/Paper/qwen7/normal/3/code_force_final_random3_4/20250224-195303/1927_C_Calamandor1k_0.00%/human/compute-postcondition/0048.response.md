To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information:

1. **Final Values of `count_a` and `count_b`:**
   - These values are determined by the elements of lists `a` and `b` up to the maximum length between the two lists.
   - `count_a` and `count_b` represent the counts of certain conditions or criteria based on the elements in lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Variable `i`:**
   - `i` is equal to the maximum length of lists `a` and `b`.

3. **Condition in the `print` statement:**
   - The statement `print('YES' if count_a >= d and count_b >= d else 'NO')` checks if both `count_a` and `count_b` are greater than or equal to `d`.
   - If both conditions are true, it prints `'YES'`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `'NO'`.

Given the initial state and the nature of the problem, we need to focus on the final values of `count_a`, `count_b`, and `d` to determine the output.

Since the exact values of `count_a`, `count_b`, and `d` are not provided, we can only describe the output based on the logical condition.

Output: **'YES' if count_a >= d and count_b >= d else 'NO'**
