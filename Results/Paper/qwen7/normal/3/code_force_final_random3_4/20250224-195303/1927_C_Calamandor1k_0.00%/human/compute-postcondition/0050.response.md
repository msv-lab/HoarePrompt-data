Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input split into integers.**

Explanation: The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. Since the initial state does not specify the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, they are now holding the values provided by the user's input. The loop condition `i < t` mentioned in the initial state is no longer relevant because the loop has already completed all its iterations.
