Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Looping Issue**: The loop `for i in range(max(len_a, len_b)):` is unnecessary and incorrect. It iterates up to the maximum length of `a` and `b`, but we need to ensure that there are enough unique numbers from 1 to `k` in both arrays combined, not just up to the maximum length.

2. **Counting Logic**: The logic for counting the numbers in `a` and `b` that are less than or equal to `k` is flawed. It does not correctly account for the requirement that every integer from 1 to `k` must be included in the chosen elements.

3. **Missing Handling of Duplicates**: The code does not handle duplicates properly. It simply increments the count for each element without ensuring that the required numbers are present.

4. **Incorrect Approach**: The current approach checks if there are at least `d` elements in each array that are less than or equal to `k`, but it does not ensure that these elements include all numbers from 1 to `k`.

### Correct Solution:
Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = set(map(int, input().split()))
        b = set(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if all numbers from 1 to k are present in either a or b
        if all(num in a or num in b for num in range(1, k+1)):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This solution uses sets to store the unique elements of `a` and `b`, and then checks if all numbers from 1 to `k` are present in either set. This ensures that the requirement of having every integer from 1 to `k` included among the chosen elements is met.
