Given the initial state where `j` is 2 and `n` is a positive integer, the `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will generate and print a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n`.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 and ending at `n + 1 - 1`, which is `n`.
2. The `*` operator before `range(1, n + 1)` unpacks the range object into individual arguments for the `print` function, effectively printing each number in the sequence separated by spaces.

Since `n` is a positive integer but its exact value is not specified, we cannot provide a specific numerical output. However, we know the form of the output will be a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n`.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is a positive integer)**
