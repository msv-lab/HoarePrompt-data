Output: **1 2 3 ... n**

Explanation:
- `j` is explicitly given as 3, but it is not used in the `print` statement.
- `n` is a positive integer, but its exact value is not specified. Therefore, we represent it as `n` in the output.
- `r` is mentioned but its value is irrelevant to the `print` statement, so it is not included in the output.

The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to `n` (inclusive). The `*` operator is used to unpack this sequence into individual arguments for the `print` function, which then prints them separated by spaces. Thus, the output will be a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
