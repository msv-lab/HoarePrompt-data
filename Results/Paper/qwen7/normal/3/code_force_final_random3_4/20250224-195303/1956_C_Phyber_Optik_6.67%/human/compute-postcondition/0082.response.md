Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `j` is explicitly given as 1.
   - `n + r + 1` is derived from the condition where \( r \) is the largest integer such that \( r \times n < \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \).
   - \( j > n \) is also given, but this condition alone does not provide a specific value for `n`.

2. **Understanding \( r \):**
   - To find \( r \), we need to determine the largest integer \( r \) such that \( r \times n < \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \).
   - This inequality can be rewritten as \( r < \frac{n + 1}{2} \).
   - Therefore, \( r \) is the largest integer less than \( \frac{n + 1}{2} \).

3. **Expression for \( n + r + 1 \):**
   - Since \( r \) is the largest integer less than \( \frac{n + 1}{2} \), let's denote \( r = \left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor - 1 \).
   - Thus, \( n + r + 1 = n + \left( \left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor - 1 \right) + 1 = n + \left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor \).

4. **Value of \( j \% n \):**
   - Given \( j = 1 \), we need to find \( 1 \% n \).
   - The modulo operation \( 1 \% n \) results in 1 for any positive integer \( n \).

5. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(2, j % n, end=' ')`.
   - We know \( j \% n = 1 \).
   - Therefore, the print statement will output `2 1`.

Output: **2 1**
