Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range `range(1, n + 1)`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i = 1` because the range is `range(1, n + 1)`.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

4. **Adjust the states based on the loop head**:
   - The variable `i` must start at 1.
   - The variable `n` must be a positive integer for the loop to execute.

5. **Consider other given states**:
   - `j` is initialized as `n + r + 1`.
   - `r` is the largest integer such that `r * n < n * (n + 1) / 2`.
   - `t` is decreased by 1.
   - `sum` is 0.
   - `r` is 0.

Since the loop head only involves `i` and the range `range(1, n + 1)`, we only need to ensure that `i` starts at 1 and `n` is a positive integer.

Given the initial values:
- `j` is `n + r + 1`.
- `r` is 0, so `j` becomes `n + 0 + 1 = n + 1`.
- `t` is decreased by 1.
- `sum` is 0.
- `r` is 0.

These states do not directly affect the loop execution but can be noted for completeness.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `i` must be 1.
- `n` must be a positive integer.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be a positive integer**
