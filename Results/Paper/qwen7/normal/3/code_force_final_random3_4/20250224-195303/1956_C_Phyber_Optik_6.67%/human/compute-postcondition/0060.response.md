Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, and the condition \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 \leq i \times n \) holds; `sum` is `i * n`.**

Explanation: The code updates the `sum` variable by adding the value of `i * n` to it. Given the initial state where `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer, and the condition \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 \leq i \times n \) holds, the value of `sum` becomes `i * n`, which is `1 * n` or simply `n`. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
