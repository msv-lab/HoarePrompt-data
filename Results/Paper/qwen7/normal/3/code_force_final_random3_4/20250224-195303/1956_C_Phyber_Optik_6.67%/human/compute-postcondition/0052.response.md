Output State: **`j` is `n + r + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `r` is the largest integer such that `r * n < n * (n + 1) / 2`, `t` is decreased by 1**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input to `n`. This changes the value of `n` to the input integer, but does not affect `j`, `r`, or `t`. The initial state of `j` is given as `n + r + 1`, and `r` is defined as the largest integer such that \( r \times n < \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \). The value of `t` is decreased by 1, but since `t` was not initially specified, we only know that it has been decreased by 1.
