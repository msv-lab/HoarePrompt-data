Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is defined by the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for each value of `i` in the range from `1` to `n + 1`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `sum` is either `2 * sum + n * (n + 1) // 2` or `sum + i * n`.
   - `j` is `n + 1`.
   - `n` is at least `1`.
   - `t` is an input integer representing the number of remaining iterations.
   - `r` is either `i` or `0` depending on whether the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true or false.
   - `i` is `i + 1`.

4. **Determine the Next State:**
   - Since the loop increments `i` by `1` at the end of each iteration, `i` will be `i + 1` at the start of the next iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must still be within the range `1` to `n + 1`.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - `i` will be `i + 1` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `n` remains the same as it does not change within the loop.

6. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `sum` will be updated based on the current value of `i` and `n`.
   - `j` will remain `n + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `t` remains unchanged.
   - `r` will be updated based on the new value of `i` and `n`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `sum` will be updated based on the new value of `i` and `n`.
- `j` will remain `n + 1`.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `r` will be updated based on the new value of `i` and `n`.

Since the exact value of `sum` depends on the previous state and the loop body, we cannot specify it precisely without the loop body. However, we know the general form of its update.

Therefore, the final state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`sum` is either `2 * sum + n * (n + 1) // 2` or `sum + (i + 1) * n`, `j` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least `1`, `t` is an input integer representing the number of remaining iterations, `r` is either `i + 1` or `0` depending on whether the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > (i + 1) * n` is true or false, `i` is `i + 1**
