Output State: **`sum` is either `2 * sum + n * (n + 1) // 2` or `sum + (i + 1) * n`, `j` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least `1`, `t` is an input integer representing the number of remaining iterations, `r` is `i + 1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `r` is assigned the value of `i`.**

Explanation: The code `r = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `r`. Since `i` is updated to `i + 1` before this line, `r` now holds the value of `i + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
