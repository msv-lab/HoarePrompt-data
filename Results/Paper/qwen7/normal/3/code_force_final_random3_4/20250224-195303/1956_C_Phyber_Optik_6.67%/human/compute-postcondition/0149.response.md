Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `sum` will contain the total sum calculated based on the conditions within the loop for all given `t` iterations. `j` will be `n + r + 1` for the last iteration, `n` will be 0, `t` will be 0 (since all iterations are completed), `r` will be the last value of `i` that satisfied the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` or 0 if no such `i` exists, and `i` will be `n` (which is 0).**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `sum` will hold the cumulative sum calculated according to the rules defined in the loop for each of the `t` inputs. The variable `j` will reflect the final value of `n + r + 1` from the last iteration, `n` will be set to 0 as it is decremented to 0 after the loop completes, `t` will be 0 indicating that there are no more iterations left, `r` will be the last valid value of `i` that met the specified condition or 0 if no such value existed, and `i` will also be 0 as it is set to `n` which is now 0.
