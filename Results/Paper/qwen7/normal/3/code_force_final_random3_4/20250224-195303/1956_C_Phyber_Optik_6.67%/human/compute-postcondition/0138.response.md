Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `r` is an integer.
- `n + r + 1` is a positive integer.
- `j` is updated to `j + 1`, but the value of `j` itself is not used in the print statement.

The `print(*range(1, n + 1))` statement will print the numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive. Since `n` is a non-negative integer, the range will start from 1 and go up to `n`.

Output: **1 2 ... n** (where the numbers from 1 to n are printed)
