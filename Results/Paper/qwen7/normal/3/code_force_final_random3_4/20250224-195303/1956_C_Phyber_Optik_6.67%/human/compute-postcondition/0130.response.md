Based on the initial state provided:

- `n + r + 1` is a positive integer.
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `j` is greater than `n`.

We need to determine the values that will be printed by the statement `print(2, j % n, end=' ')`.

1. The first value printed is `2`, which is explicitly stated in the `print` statement.
2. The second value printed is `j % n`, which is the remainder when `j` is divided by `n`.

Given that `j` is greater than `n`, the remainder when `j` is divided by `n` will be a value between `0` and `n-1` (inclusive). However, since the exact value of `j` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact remainder without more information. But we know it will be a valid remainder.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **2, [remainder of j divided by n]**
