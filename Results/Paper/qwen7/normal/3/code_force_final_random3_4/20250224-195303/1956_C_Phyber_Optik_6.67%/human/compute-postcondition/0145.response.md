Given the initial state:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `r` is an integer.
- `n + r + 1` is a positive integer.
- `j` is `j_start + 2`.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Understanding `range(1, n + 1)`**: 
   - This function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to but not including `n + 1`.
   - Therefore, if `n` is a non-negative integer, `range(1, n + 1)` will generate a sequence from 1 to `n`.

2. **Using `*` with `range`**:
   - The `*` operator unpacks the range object into separate arguments for the `print` function.
   - So, `print(*range(1, n + 1))` will print each number in the range separated by spaces.

3. **Output**:
   - Since `n` is a non-negative integer, the output will be a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`, each number separated by a space.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **1 2 ... (n-1) n** (where `n` is the non-negative integer specified in the initial state)
