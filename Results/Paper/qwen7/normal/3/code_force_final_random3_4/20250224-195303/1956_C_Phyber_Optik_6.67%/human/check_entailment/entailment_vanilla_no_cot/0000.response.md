Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Sum Calculation**: The sum calculation in the program is incorrect. The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations. The current logic does not achieve this.

2. **Operations Execution**: The program incorrectly prints the operations. It attempts to fill the matrix in a way that does not necessarily maximize the sum. Specifically, the operations are not designed to place the highest possible values in the matrix.

3. **Permutations**: The permutations used in the operations are not optimal. The program simply prints sequences from 1 to \( n \) without considering the structure of the matrix to maximize the sum.

To correctly solve the problem, the approach should be to fill the matrix in such a way that the sum is maximized. One effective strategy is to use \( n \) Type 1 operations to fill the first row with the sequence \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \), and then use \( n \) Type 2 operations to fill the first column with the sequence \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \). This ensures that the maximum possible value (which is \( n \)) is placed in the diagonal elements, contributing significantly to the sum.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        # Calculate the maximum possible sum
        max_sum = n * (n + 1) * n // 2
        # Number of operations needed
        operations = 2 * n
        print(max_sum, operations)
        
        # Perform Type 1 operations to fill the first row
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, i, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))
        
        # Perform Type 2 operations to fill the first column
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            print(2, j, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the sum is maximized and the operations are performed within the constraints.
