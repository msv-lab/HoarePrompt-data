Output State: **`sum` is `sum + i * n`, `j` is `n + 1`, `n` is at least `1`, `t` is an input integer representing the number of remaining iterations, `r` is either `i` or `0` depending on whether the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true or false, `i` is `i + 1`**.

Explanation: The code `sum += i * n` updates the value of `sum` by adding `i * n` to its current value. All other variables (`j`, `n`, `t`, `r`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
