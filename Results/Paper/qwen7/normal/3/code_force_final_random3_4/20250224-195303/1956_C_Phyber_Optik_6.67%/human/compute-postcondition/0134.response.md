Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `r` is an integer.
- `n + r + 1` is a positive integer.
- If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the values of `n`, `r`, and `j` do not change.
- If `j` is greater than `n`, the values of `n`, `r`, and `n + r + 1` do not change.

### Loop Head:
- The loop iterates over `j` from `1` to `n + r + 1`.

### Conditions for the Next Iteration:
- For the loop to continue, `j` must be within the range `1` to `n + r + 1`.

### Analysis:
- If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the values of `n`, `r`, and `j` remain unchanged.
- If `j` is greater than `n`, the values of `n`, `r`, and `n + r + 1` remain unchanged.

Since the loop head does not change the values of `n`, `r`, and `j` based on the condition, we need to consider the range of `j` for the next iteration.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Determine the current value of `j`:**
   - Let's assume `j` is currently `k` (where `k` is some integer).

2. **Check the condition for the next iteration:**
   - The loop will continue if `k < n + r + 1`.

3. **Adjust the state for the next iteration:**
   - If `k < n + r + 1`, then `j` will be incremented by 1 in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, the new value of `j` will be `k + 1`.

4. **Ensure the conditions are met:**
   - Since the values of `n` and `r` do not change, they remain the same.
   - The condition `n + r + 1` remains the same as well.

### Final State:
- The value of `j` will be `k + 1` (where `k` was the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration).
- The values of `n` and `r` remain unchanged.
- The condition `n + r + 1` remains the same.

### Example Answer:
If `j` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then for the next iteration:

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `r` is an integer, and `n + r + 1` is a positive integer. `j` is `k + 1`.**

However, since the exact value of `j` is not specified, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `r` is an integer, and `n + r + 1` is a positive integer. `j` is `j + 1`.**

So, the final state for the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `r` is an integer, and `n + r + 1` is a positive integer. `j` is `j + 1`.**
