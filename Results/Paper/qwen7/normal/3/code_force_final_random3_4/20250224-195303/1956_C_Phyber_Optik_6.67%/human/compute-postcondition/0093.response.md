Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `j` is explicitly given as 3.
   - `n + r + 1` is derived from the condition where \( r \) is the largest integer such that \( r \times n < \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \).

2. To find the value of `r`:
   - We need to determine the largest integer \( r \) that satisfies the inequality \( r \times n < \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \).
   - This inequality can be rearranged to \( r < \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2n} = \frac{n + 1}{2} \).
   - Therefore, \( r \) is the floor value of \( \frac{n + 1}{2} \).

3. Since the exact value of `n` is not given, let's consider the general case:
   - If \( n \) is even, \( \frac{n + 1}{2} \) is a half-integer, so \( r \) would be \( \frac{n}{2} \).
   - If \( n \) is odd, \( \frac{n + 1}{2} \) is an integer, so \( r \) would be \( \frac{n + 1}{2} \).

4. Given the print statement:
   - The statement `print(1, j, end=' ')` will print the integer 1, followed by the value of `j` (which is 3), with no newline character (`end=' '`).

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **1 3**
