Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `r` is an integer.
- `n + r + 1` is a positive integer.
- `j` is `j + 1`.

Given these conditions, the value of `j` after the statement `j = j + 1` will be `j + 1`. However, the initial value of `j` is not specified. Since it is not explicitly defined, we can only refer to it as `j + 1`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(1, j, end=' ')
```

This will print the number 1 followed by the value of `j + 1` without a newline due to the `end=' '` parameter.

Output: **1 j + 1**
