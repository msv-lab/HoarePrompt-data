Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: After all iterations of the loop, `sum` will be the total sum calculated based on the conditions within the loop, `j` will be equal to `n + r + 1`, `n` will be 0 since it is decremented to 0 after the loop, `t` will be the original input integer representing the number of remaining iterations, `r` will be the last value of `i` that satisfied the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` or 0 if no such `i` exists, and `i` will be `n` (which is 0).

In more detail, `sum` accumulates values based on the conditions inside the loop until `n` reaches 0. The variable `j` starts from `n + r + 1` and remains unchanged as the loop progresses. `n` is decremented in each iteration until it becomes 0. The variable `t` and `r` retain their values from the last iteration of the loop. The variable `i` starts from 1 and increases by 1 in each iteration until `n` becomes 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + r + 1):
    if j <= n:
        print(1, j, end=' ')
        print(*range(1, n + 1))
    else:
        print(2, j % n, end=' ')
        print(*range(1, n + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `n` is a non-negative integer, `r` is an integer, and `n + r + 1` is a positive integer. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the program does not change the values of `n`, `r`, and `j`. If `j` is greater than `n`, the program does not change the values of `n`, `r`, and `n + r + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `n` is a non-negative integer, `r` is an integer, and `n + r + 1` is a positive integer. `j` is incremented by 1 in both cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a non-negative integer, `r` is an integer, and `n + r + 1` is a positive integer. `j` remains `j_start + 2` regardless of whether `j <= n` is true or false.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
