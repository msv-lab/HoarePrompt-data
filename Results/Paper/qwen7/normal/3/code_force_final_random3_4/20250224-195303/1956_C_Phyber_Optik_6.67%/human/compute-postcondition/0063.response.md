Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the initial conditions**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - The postcondition states that if \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 \) is greater than \( i \times n \), then `r` is 1 and `sum` is \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 \). Otherwise, `sum` is \( i \times n \).

3. **Determine the next value of `i`**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 1` and increments by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - Given that `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` will be `2`.

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < n + 1`.
   - Since `i` is now 2, the loop will continue as long as `2 < n + 1`, which simplifies to `n > 1`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we need to adjust these.
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `n` remains a positive integer, but it must still satisfy the condition `n > 1`.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1**.
