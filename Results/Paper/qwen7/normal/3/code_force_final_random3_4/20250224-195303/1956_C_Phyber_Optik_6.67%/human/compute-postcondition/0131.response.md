Based on the initial state provided:

- `n + r + 1` is a positive integer.
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `j` is greater than `n`.

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(*range(1, n + 1))`.

Let's break it down:

1. `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 up to but not including `n + 1`.
2. The `*` operator is used to unpack the range object, so `print(*range(1, n + 1))` will print each number in the sequence separated by spaces.

Given that `n` is a non-negative integer, the range will start from 1 and go up to `n` (inclusive).

Therefore, the output will be the numbers from 1 to `n` printed as a space-separated sequence.

Output: **1 2 ... n**
