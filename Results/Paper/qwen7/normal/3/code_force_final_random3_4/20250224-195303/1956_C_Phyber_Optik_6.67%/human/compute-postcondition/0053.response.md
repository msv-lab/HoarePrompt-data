Output State: **`j` is `n + r + 1`, `n` is an input integer, `r` is the largest integer such that `r * n < n * (n + 1) / 2`, `t` is decreased by 1, `sum` is 0, `r` is 0**.

Explanation: The code initializes `sum` to 0 and `r` to 0. The values of `j`, `n`, `r`, and `t` remain unchanged from their initial state.
