Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `j <= n + r + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `j` is 2
   - `n` is a positive integer
   - `r` remains unchanged

4. **Determine the new value of `j` for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2.
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will become 3.

5. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop continues as long as `j <= n + r + 1`.
   - Given that `j` is now 3, the condition becomes `3 <= n + r + 1`.
   - Simplifying this, we get `2 <= n + r`.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - `j` will be 3.
   - `n` remains a positive integer.
   - `r` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`j` is 3, `n` is a positive integer, and `r` remains unchanged**.
