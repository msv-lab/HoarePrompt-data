Output State: After all iterations of the loop, `sum` will be the total sum calculated based on the conditions within the loop, `j` will be equal to `n + r + 1`, `n` will be 0 since it is decremented to 0 after the loop, `t` will be the original input integer representing the number of remaining iterations, `r` will be the last value of `i` that satisfied the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` or 0 if no such `i` exists, and `i` will be `n` (which is 0).

In more detail, `sum` accumulates values based on the conditions inside the loop until `n` reaches 0. The variable `j` starts from `n + r + 1` and remains unchanged as the loop progresses. `n` is decremented in each iteration until it becomes 0. The variable `t` and `r` retain their values from the last iteration of the loop. The variable `i` starts from 1 and increases by 1 in each iteration until `n` becomes 0.
