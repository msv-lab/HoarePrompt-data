Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j < n + 1`.

3. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `c` is decreased by 1.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 1.
   - `cntl[j]` is less than 2.
   - The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` starts from 1 and the loop runs until `j < n + 1`, the next value of `j` would be 2 (assuming `n` remains the same).
   - The condition `cntl[j]` being less than 2 must still hold true for `j = 2`.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.

5. **Formulate the new state**:
   - `c` is decreased by 1 (this does not change as it is not part of the loop head).
   - `j` becomes 2.
   - `n` remains greater than or equal to 1.
   - `cntl[2]` must be less than 2 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`c` is decreased by 1, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `cntl[2]` is less than 2**.
