Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4), another positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a list a of n non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i < n). For each test case, the function returns a result based on the values of t, n, and the list a.**

This means the function takes a structured input consisting of multiple test cases, each containing a value for t, n, and a list a. It then processes these inputs according to the specified constraints and returns a result for each test case.
