You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cntl = [0 for _ in range(n + 1)]
        for i in a:
            cntl[i] += 1
        if cntl[0] == 0:
            print(0)
        else:
            c = min(2, cntl[0])
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                if cntl[j] < 2:
                    c -= 1
                    if not c or j == n:
                        print(j)
                        break



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( n \) and a list \( a \) of \( n \) non-negative integers. For each test case, it calculates the frequency of each integer in the list \( a \) and determines the smallest index \( i \) (greater than 0) where the frequency of \( i \) is less than 2. If no such index exists, it prints \( n \). The function outputs the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the logic to find the game's final score under optimal play by both Alice and Bob.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - It initializes a list `cntl` of size `n + 1` to count occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - It populates `cntl` with the counts of each element from `a`.

3. **Initial Check for Zero:**
   - If `cntl[0]` is zero, it prints `0`. This means there are no zeros in the array, and since Alice can pick any zero, the MEX will be `0`.

4. **Calculating MEX:**
   - Otherwise, it calculates the initial value of `c` as `min(2, cntl[0])`. This means Alice can ensure at least two elements are picked (including possibly a zero).
   - It then iterates through the counts from `1` to `n`:
     - If `cntl[j]` is less than `2`, it decrements `c` by `1`.
     - If `c` becomes `0` or it reaches the end of the loop, it prints `j`.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Initial Check for Zero:**
   - This part is correct. If there are no zeros, Alice can always pick a zero, making the MEX `0`.

2. **Calculating MEX:**
   - The logic for calculating `c` and decrementing it seems to handle the optimal moves for Alice and Bob.
   - However, the logic should consider the following:
     - Alice can ensure that at least two elements are picked, including possibly a zero.
     - Bob will try to minimize the MEX, so he will pick elements strategically.
     - The key is to ensure that the smallest missing number is determined correctly after both players have made their optimal moves.

### Detailed Example Verification

Let's verify the example given in the problem statement:

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: `4 0 0 1 1`
- `cntl` will be `[2, 2, 0, 0]`
- `c` is `min(2, 2) = 2`
- Iterate through `cntl`:
  - `j = 1`: `cntl[1] = 2` (not less than 2), so `c` remains `2`.
  - `j = 2`: `cntl[2] = 0` (less than 2), so `c` becomes `1`.
  - `j = 3`: `cntl[3] = 0` (less than 2), so `c` becomes `0`.
  - Print `2` (correct).

#### Test Case 2:
- Input: `4 0 1 2 3`
- `cntl` will be `[1, 1, 1, 1]`
- `c` is `min(2, 1) = 1`
- Iterate through `cntl`:
  - `j = 1`: `cntl[1] = 1` (not less than 2), so `c` remains `1`.
  - `j = 2`: `cntl[2] = 1` (not less than 2), so `c` remains `1`.
  - `j = 3`: `cntl[3] = 1` (not less than 2), so `c` remains `1`.
  - Print `1` (correct).

#### Test Case 3:
- Input: `2 1 1`
- `cntl` will be `[0, 2]`
- `c` is `min(2, 0) = 0`
- Iterate through `cntl`:
  - `j = 1`: `cntl[1] = 2` (not less than 2), so `c` remains `0`.
  - Print `0` (correct).
