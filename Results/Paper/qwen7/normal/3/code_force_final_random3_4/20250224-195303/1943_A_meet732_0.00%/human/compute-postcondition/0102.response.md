Output State: The list `cntl` will be updated such that each index `i` (where `i` is an element in the list `a`) will have a value equal to the number of times `i` appears in `a`.

In Natural Language: After the loop completes all its iterations, the `cntl` list will contain counts for each unique element found in the list `a`. Specifically, if an element `i` appears `x` times in `a`, then `cntl[i]` will be `x`. All other elements in `cntl` that do not correspond to any element in `a` will remain `0`.
