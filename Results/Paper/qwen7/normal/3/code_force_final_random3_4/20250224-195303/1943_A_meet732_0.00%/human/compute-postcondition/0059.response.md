Postcondition: **`cntl` is a list where each index corresponds to an element in `a`, and the value at each index represents the frequency count of that particular element in `a`. All other variables (`c`, `j`, `n`, and `a`) retain their final values from after the loop has completed its iterations. The first element of `cntl` is 0.**
