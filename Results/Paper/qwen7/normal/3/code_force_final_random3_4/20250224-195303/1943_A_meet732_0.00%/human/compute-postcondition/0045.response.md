Postcondition: **The `cntl` list will contain the count of how many times each integer from the input list `a` appeared. If the value at index 0 of `cntl` is 0, then the value at index 0 remains unchanged. Otherwise, `c` is decreased by 3, `j` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, and `cntl[2]` is less than 2.**

In Natural Language: After executing the if-else block, the `cntl` list will contain the count of how many times each integer from the input list `a` appeared. If the value at index 0 of `cntl` is 0, the value at index 0 remains unchanged. Otherwise, `c` is decreased by 3, `j` is set to 3, `n` is greater than 2, and `cntl[2]` is less than 2.
