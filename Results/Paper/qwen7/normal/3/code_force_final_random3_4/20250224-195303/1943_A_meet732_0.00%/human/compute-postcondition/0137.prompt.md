Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and a is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cntl = [(0) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in a:
        cntl[i] += 1
    if cntl[0] == 0:
        print(0)
    else:
        c = min(2, cntl[0])
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if cntl[j] < 2:
                c -= 1
                if not c or j == n:
                    print(j)
                    break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The `cntl` list will contain the count of how many times each integer from the input list `a` appeared. If the value at index 0 of `cntl` is 0, then the value at index 0 remains unchanged. Otherwise, `c` is decreased by 3, `j` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, and `cntl[2]` is less than 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cntl` is a list where each index corresponds to an element in `a`, and the value at each index represents the frequency count of that particular element in `a`. All other variables (`c`, `j`, `n`, and `a`) retain their final values from after the loop has completed its iterations. If the first element of `cntl` is 0, then `j` is 3, `n` is greater than 2, `c` is -2, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After the if-else block executes, the `cntl` list will be updated such that each index `i` (where `i` is an element in the list `a`) will have a value equal to the number of times `i` appears in `a`. Specifically, if an element `i` appears `x` times in `a`, then `cntl[i]` will be `x`. All other elements in `cntl` that do not correspond to any element in `a` will remain `0`. Additionally, `cntl[0]` will be `0`. If the loop breaks early due to `c` becoming `0` or `j` reaching `n`, the final value of `c` will be `n - j`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
