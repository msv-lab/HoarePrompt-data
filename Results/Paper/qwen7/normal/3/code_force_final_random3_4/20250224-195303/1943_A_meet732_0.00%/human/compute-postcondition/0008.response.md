Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in a:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and the iterable `a`.

2. **Understand the Iteration**: At the end of the previous iteration, `cntl[i]` was incremented by 1, and `i` was updated to `i + 1`.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration Conditions**: For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i in a` must hold true. This means `i` must still be an element of the iterable `a`.

4. **Update the States**:
   - Since `i` was updated to `i + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to continue, `i` must now be `i + 1`.
   - The iterable `a` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise.

Given these points, we can conclude that `i` needs to be updated to `i + 1` for the next iteration, and `a` remains as it was.

**Final State**:
State: **`cntl[i]` is increased by 1, `i` is `i + 1`, `a` is the same iterable**
