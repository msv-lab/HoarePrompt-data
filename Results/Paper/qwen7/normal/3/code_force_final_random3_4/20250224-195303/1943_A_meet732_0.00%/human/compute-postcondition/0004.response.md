Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in a:`. The variables involved here are `i` and `a`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`. For the loop to execute, `a` must contain at least one element.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - The variable `i` will take on the values from the list `a` during each iteration.
   - The list `a` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

4. **Consider the initial state**:
   - `a` is a list of integers entered by the user.
   - `n` is an integer value entered by the user.
   - `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where every element is 0.

Since the loop depends on the list `a`, we need to ensure that `a` contains at least one element. The other variables (`n` and `cntl`) are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`a` must contain at least one element**.
