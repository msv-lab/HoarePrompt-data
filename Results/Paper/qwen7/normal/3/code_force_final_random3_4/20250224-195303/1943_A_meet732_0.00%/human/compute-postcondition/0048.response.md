Output State: **`c` is decreased by 3, `j` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `cntl[2]` is less than 2, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into a list of strings using spaces as delimiters, and then converts each string to an integer. The original values of `c` and `j` remain unchanged, `n` remains an input integer, and `cntl[2]` remains less than 2. The new variable `a` is created and holds the list of integers obtained from the input.
