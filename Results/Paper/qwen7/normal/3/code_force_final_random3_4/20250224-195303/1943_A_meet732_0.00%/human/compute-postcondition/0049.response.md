Output State: **`c` is decreased by 3, `j` is 3, `n` is an input integer, `cntl` is a list of n+1 zeros, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string**.

Explanation: The code initializes `cntl` as a list of `n + 1` zeros using a list comprehension. The value of `c` is decreased by 3 and remains unchanged, `j` is 3 and remains unchanged, `n` is an input integer and remains unchanged, and `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and remains unchanged.
