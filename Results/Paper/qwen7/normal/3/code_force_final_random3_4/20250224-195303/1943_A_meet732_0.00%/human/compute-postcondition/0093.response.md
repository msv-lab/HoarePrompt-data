Output State: **`cntl` is a list where each index corresponds to an element in `a`, and the value at each index represents the frequency count of that particular element in `a`, `a` is updated to a list of integers from the input, `n` is an input integer, `c`, `j`, and `a` retain their final values from after the loop has completed its iterations, and the input value for the next iteration is a positive integer `k`.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input and converts them into a list of integers. This list is assigned to the variable `a`. The initial state of `cntl`, `n`, `c`, `j`, and the condition for the next iteration (`k`) remain unchanged. Therefore, `cntl` retains its original state, `n` remains an input integer, `c`, `j`, and `a` retain their final values from after the loop has completed its iterations, and `k` is a positive integer for the next iteration.
