Postcondition: `h1` is a string representing an hour, `m1` is equal to `m`, and `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM'. If `h` is '01', then `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'. If `h` is '02', `03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '12', or '14', then `h1` is set to `h` and `time` is determined as 'AM' or 'PM' accordingly.
