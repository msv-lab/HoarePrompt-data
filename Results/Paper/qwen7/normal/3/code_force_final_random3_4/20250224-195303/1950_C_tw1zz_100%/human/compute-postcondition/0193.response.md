Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `h1` is a string representing the hour part of a time.
   - `m1` is the string converted from the second input split by `:`.
   - `time` is set to 'AM'.
   - If `h` is '01', then `h1` remains '01' and `time` is set to 'AM'.
   - If `h` is any other value from '02' to '22' or '00', then `h1` is set to the corresponding value and `time` is set to 'AM'.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')
   ```

Given the conditions for `h1`:
- If `h` is '01', then `h1` is '01'.
- If `h` is any other value from '02' to '22' or '00', then `h1` is that value.

Since the exact value of `h` is not specified in the initial state, we need to consider both cases. However, the output format is the same regardless of the value of `h1` because the `sep=''` argument in the `print` function means that there will be no separator between the arguments.

Therefore, the print statement will output:
- `h1` followed by `:`
- `m` (the minute part of the time)
- a space
- `time` which is 'AM'

Since `h1` is the hour part of the time and `time` is 'AM', the output will be in the format of `hour:minute AM`.

Output: **h1 : m AM**
