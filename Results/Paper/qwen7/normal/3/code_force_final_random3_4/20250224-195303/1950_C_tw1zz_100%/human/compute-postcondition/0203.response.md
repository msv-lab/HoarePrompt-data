Output State: **`h1` is '03', `m1` is equal to `m`, `time` is 'AM'**.

Explanation: The code assigns the string `'AM'` to the variable `time`. The values of `h1` and `m1` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `h1` is still `'03'` and `m1` is still equal to `m`. The variable `time` now holds the value `'AM'`.
