Output State: **`h1` is '10', `m1` is the string converted from the second input split by `:`, `time` is 'PM', and `h` is '22'.**

Explanation: The code assigns the string `'PM'` to the variable `time`. This changes the value of `time` but does not affect the values of `h1`, `m1`, or `h`. Therefore, these variables retain their original values.
