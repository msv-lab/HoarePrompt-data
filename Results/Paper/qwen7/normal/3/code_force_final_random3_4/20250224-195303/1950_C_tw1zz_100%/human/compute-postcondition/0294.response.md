To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `h1` is a string representing an hour.
   - `m1` is equal to `m`.
   - `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM'.
   - If `h` is '01', then `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'.
   - If `h` is '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '12', or '14', then `h1` is set to `h` and `time` is determined as 'AM' or 'PM' accordingly.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')
   ```
   This statement prints `h1`, followed by a colon `:`, then `m`, a space, and finally `time`, with no separator between them (`sep=''`).

3. **Determine Values:**
   - Since the exact value of `h` is not specified, we need to consider both cases mentioned in the initial state.
   - If `h` is '01', then `h1` is '01' and `time` is 'AM'.
   - If `h` is any other valid hour ('02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '12', or '14'), then `h1` is `h` and `time` is determined as 'AM' or 'PM'.

Given these conditions, the output will depend on the value of `h`. Let's consider both scenarios:

- **Scenario 1:** If `h` is '01'
  - `h1` is '01'
  - `time` is 'AM'
  - The print statement will output: `'01 : m AM'`

- **Scenario 2:** If `h` is any other valid hour ('02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '12', or '14')
  - `h1` is `h`
  - `time` is determined as 'AM' or 'PM'
  - The print statement will output: `'h : m PM'` or `'h : m AM'` depending on the value of `h`.

Since the exact value of `h` is not provided, we cannot specify a single output. However, based on the conditions, the output will follow the format described above.

Output: **'01 : m AM' if h is '01', otherwise 'h : m AM' or 'h : m PM' where h is one of '02', '03', '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '10', '11', '12', or '14'**
