Postcondition: `h1` is a string representing an hour, `m1` is equal to `m`, and `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM'. If `h` is '03', then `h1` is '03' and `time` is 'AM'. Otherwise, `h1` can be '04', '05', '06', '07', '08', '09', '01', '02', '07', '08', '10', '11', '12', or '14', and `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM'.
