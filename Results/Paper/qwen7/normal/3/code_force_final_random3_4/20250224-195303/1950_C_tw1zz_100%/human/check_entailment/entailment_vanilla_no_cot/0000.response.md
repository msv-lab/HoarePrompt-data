Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program is incorrect because it does not handle the conversion logic efficiently. Specifically, the program uses a series of `if-elif` statements to convert the 24-hour format to 12-hour format, which is inefficient and redundant. A more concise and efficient way to handle this conversion is to use the modulo operator `%` and simple conditional checks.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (h, m) = map(str, input().split(':'))
        h1 = str((int(h) % 12) or 12)  # Convert 24-hour format to 12-hour format
        time = 'AM' if int(h) < 12 else 'PM'
        print(f'{h1}:{m} {time}')


func()
```

This version uses the modulo operator to handle the conversion from 24-hour to 12-hour format and a simple conditional check to determine whether the time is in the AM or PM period. This approach is both more efficient and easier to understand.
