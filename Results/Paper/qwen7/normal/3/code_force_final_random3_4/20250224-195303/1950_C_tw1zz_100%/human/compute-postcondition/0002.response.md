Output State: **`h1` is an empty string, `m1` is the string converted from the second input split by ':'**

Explanation: The code assigns an empty string to `h1` and assigns the value of `m` (which is a string converted from the second input split by ':') to `m1`. The value of `h` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
