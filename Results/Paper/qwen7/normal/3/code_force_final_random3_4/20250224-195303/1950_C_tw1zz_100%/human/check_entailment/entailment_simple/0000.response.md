Reasoning:
The provided code attempts to convert a time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format. However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Redundant Code**: The code uses a series of `if-elif` statements to convert the hour from 24-hour format to 12-hour format. This can be simplified using modulo arithmetic, which would make the code more efficient and easier to maintain.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Midnight and Noon**: The code incorrectly handles the conversion of '00' to '12' AM. It should directly set `h1` to '12' and `time` to 'AM' without any additional checks.

3. **Unnecessary Variables**: The variables `h1`, `m1`, and `time` are unnecessary. The original `h` and `m` can be used directly after the conversion.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        h, m = input().split(':')
        h1 = str((int(h) % 12) or 12)
        time = 'AM' if int(h) < 12 else 'PM'
        print(f'{h1}:{m} {time}')
```

With this corrected version, the code works as expected and handles all edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **False**
