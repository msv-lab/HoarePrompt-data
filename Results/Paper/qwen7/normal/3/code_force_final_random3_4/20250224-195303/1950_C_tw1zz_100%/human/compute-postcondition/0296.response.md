The code reads two values from the user input, separated by a colon, and assigns them to variables `h` and `m`. Since the initial state specifies that `h1` is a string representing an hour and `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM', the values of `h1` and `time` are not directly affected by the input. The input values are stored in `h` and `m`.

Output State: **`h1` is a string representing an hour, `m1` is equal to `m`, and `time` is either 'AM' or 'PM'; `h` is the input hour and `m` is the input minute.**
