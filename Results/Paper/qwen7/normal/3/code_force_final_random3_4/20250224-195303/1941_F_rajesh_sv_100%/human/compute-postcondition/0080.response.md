Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `l < h`.
2. **Current values before the loop**:
   - `ans` is updated based on some calculation involving `D[l]`, `f`, `left`, `right`, and `mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`.
   - `mid` is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`.
   - `l` is updated to `bisect_right(D, left - f)`.
   - `h` is updated to `l`.
   - `f` is the next value in `F`.
   - `h` is updated to `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop `l < h` to be true, `l` must be less than `h`.
   - Given that `h` is updated to `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, and `l` is updated to `bisect_right(D, left - f)`, we need to ensure that `bisect_right(D, left - f)` is less than `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `h` is updated to `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, for `l` to be less than `h`, `l` must be less than `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `l` is less than `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`.

Given these considerations, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `l` to ensure it is less than `h`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `l` must be less than `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `h` is updated to `l`, `f` is the next value in `F`, `h` is `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`**
