Output State: **`max_diff` is equal to `diff`, `next_max_diff` is equal to `max_diff`, `index` is 3, `i` is 3, `diff` is `A[1] - A[0]`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `i` to `index`. Since `i` was initially set to 3, `index` is now also 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
