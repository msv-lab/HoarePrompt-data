Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `h` is `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `l` is `mid + 1`, the condition `(mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum)` is true.**

Explanation: The code `l = mid + 1` updates the value of `l` to be `mid + 1`. All other variables (`mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `mid`, `h`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The condition mentioned in the initial state remains true as no changes were made to the variables involved in that condition.
