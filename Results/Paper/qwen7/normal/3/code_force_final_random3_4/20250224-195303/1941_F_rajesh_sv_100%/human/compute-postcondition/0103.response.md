Output State: The final state after the loop executes all iterations will have the following characteristics:

- `ans` will hold the minimum value among all the valid states calculated during the iterations, where each valid state is determined by the minimum of the current `ans` and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`.
- `mid_sum` will be the sum of `D[mid]` and `f`, where `mid` is the midpoint calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2` during the last iteration.
- `mid_next_sum` will be the sum of `D[mid + 1]` and `f`, where `mid` is the same as above.
- `l` will be the lower bound after the last iteration, which could be equal to `h` if the loop terminates due to `l >= h`.
- `h` will be the upper bound after the last iteration, which could be equal to `l` if the loop terminates due to `l >= h`.
- `f` will be the last value from the sequence `F` that was used in the loop.
- `mid` will be the last calculated midpoint before the loop terminated.

In summary, `ans` will contain the optimal solution found throughout the iterations, while `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` will reflect the sums at the last iteration, and `l` and `h` will indicate the final bounds of the search space.
