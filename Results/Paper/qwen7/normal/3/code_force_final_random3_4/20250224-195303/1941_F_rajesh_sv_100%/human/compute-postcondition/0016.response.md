Output State: **`max_diff` is -inf, `next_max_diff` is `diff`, `index` is None, `i` is 2, `diff` is `A[1] - A[0]`**

Explanation: The code sets `next_max_diff` to the value of `diff`. Since `diff` is initially set to `A[1] - A[0]` and is greater than -inf, `next_max_diff` now holds the value of `diff`. All other variables remain unchanged.
