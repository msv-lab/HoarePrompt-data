The function accepts no parameters and returns an integer value calculated by the function `func_2()`. This integer value is derived from processing inputs such as a sorted list of integers `a`, another list of integers `d`, and a third list of integers `f`, along with additional integers `n`, `m`, and `k` that define the sizes and ranges of these lists.
