Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- `total` is 0
- `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`
- `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`
- `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`
- `l` and `h` are equal to each other, representing the final boundaries of the search range

### Loop Condition:
```python
while l < h:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `l < h`.
2. **Current States**:
   - `l` and `h` are equal, meaning `l == h`.
   - Since `l == h`, the condition `l < h` is false, and the loop will not execute again.

### Adjusting States:
Since the loop condition `l < h` is false and cannot become true with the current values of `l` and `h`, no adjustments are needed to make the loop execute one more time. The loop will terminate because the condition `l < h` is never satisfied when `l` and `h` are equal.

### Conclusion:
No changes are required to the states for the loop to execute one more time because the loop condition is already false and cannot be made true with the given states.

### Final Answer:
State: **`total` is 0, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` and `h` are equal to each other**
