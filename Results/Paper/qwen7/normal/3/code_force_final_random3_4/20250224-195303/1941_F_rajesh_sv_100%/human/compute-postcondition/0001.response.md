Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `testcases` and the loop variable `_`.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: The initial state before the loop starts is given as `testcases` is the return value of `func_3()`.

3. **Analyze the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `for _ in range(testcases)`. This means the loop will execute as long as `testcases` is a non-negative integer greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop depends on `testcases`, we need to ensure that `testcases` is a positive integer (greater than 0) for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `testcases` to ensure it is a positive integer.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`testcases` must be a positive integer**
