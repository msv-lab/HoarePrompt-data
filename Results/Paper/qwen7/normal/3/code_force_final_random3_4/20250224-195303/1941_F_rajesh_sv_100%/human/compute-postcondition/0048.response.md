Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains two variables: `l` and `h`.

2. **Understand the Condition for the Loop**: The loop condition is `l < h`. For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `l < h` must be true.

3. **Current States Before the Loop**:
   - `h` is `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`
   - `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F`

4. **Determine Adjustments Needed**:
   - We need to ensure that `l < h` is true for the loop to execute the first time.
   - Since `h` is determined by `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `h` will be a specific value based on the input.
   - `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F`. This means `l` is the smallest index where `D[l] > left - F`.

5. **Ensuring the Loop Condition**:
   - To satisfy `l < h`, `l` must be less than `h`.
   - Given that `h = bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, the smallest possible value for `h` is 0 (if `right - f` is not in `D`).
   - Therefore, `l` must be less than this minimum value of `h`, which is 0.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Since `h` is at least 0, `l` must be less than 0 for the loop to execute the first time. However, since `l` is an index in the list `D`, it cannot be negative. Thus, `l` must be 0 or greater, but for the loop to execute, `l` must be strictly less than `h`.

Given the above reasoning, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `l` is less than `h`. Since `h` is at least 0, `l` must be less than 0 for the loop to execute the first time, but practically, `l` must be 0 or greater and less than `h`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`h` is `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is strictly greater than `left - F` and `l` must be less than `h`**
