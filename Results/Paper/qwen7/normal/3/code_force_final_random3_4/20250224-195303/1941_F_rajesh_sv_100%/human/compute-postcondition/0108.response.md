Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `f` from the sequence `F`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are more values in the sequence `F`. Therefore, the only variable that changes with each iteration is `f`.

3. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - `ans`: This holds the minimum value among all the updates made during the loop. It does not change based on the loop head variable `f`, so it remains the same.
   - `mid`: This is the last midpoint calculated before the loop exited. It does not change based on the loop head variable `f`, so it remains the same.
   - `l` and `h`: These represent the final boundaries of the search range. They do not change based on the loop head variable `f`, so they remain the same.
   - `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum`: These are the sums of `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f` for the last midpoint `mid`. Since `f` changes in each iteration, these values will change.
   - `f`: This is the loop head variable, and it changes with each iteration.

Given that `f` is the only variable that changes with each iteration, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `ans` remains the same.
- `mid` remains the same.
- `l` and `h` remain the same.
- `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` will be updated based on the new value of `f`.
- `f` is updated to the next value in the sequence `F`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`ans` holds the minimum value among all the updates made during the loop, `mid` is the last midpoint calculated before the loop exited, `l` and `h` are equal to each other (representing the final boundaries of the search range), `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are the sums of `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f` for the new value of `f`, and `f` is the next value from the sequence `F`**.
