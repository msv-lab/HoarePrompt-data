Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` holds the minimum value among all the updates made during the loop, `mid` is the last midpoint calculated before the loop exited, `l` is the index of the first element in `D` which is greater than `left - f`, `h` is now `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `h` and `l` are equal to each other representing the final boundaries of the search range, `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are the sums of `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f` for the new value of `f`, and `f` is the next value from the sequence `F`.
Code of the loop:
while l < h:
    mid = l + (h - l) // 2
    mid_sum, mid_next_sum = D[mid] + f, D[mid + 1] + f
    if mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum:
        l = mid + 1
    else:
        h = mid


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `total` is 0, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` and `h` are equal to each other, representing the final boundaries of the search range. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is `mid` and `mid_sum - left >= right - mid_next_sum`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: Postcondition: `total` is 0, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is set to `mid + 1` and `h` is set to `l`. Otherwise, `h` is set to `mid`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `total` is 0, `mid` is either `l + (h - l) // 2` or `l + (h - l) // 2 + 1`, `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are defined as per their respective conditions within the if and else blocks. If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `mid` is set to `l + (h - l) // 2 + 1` and `mid_sum` is undefined while `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. Otherwise, `mid` remains `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, and `h` is updated to `mid`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
