Output State: **`testcases' is the return value of func_3()`.**

The code `testcases = func_3()` assigns the return value of the function `func_3()` to the variable `testcases`. Since the exact return value of `func_3()` is not specified, we can only say that `testcases` now holds whatever value `func_3()` returns. All other variables remain in their initial state as per the precondition.
