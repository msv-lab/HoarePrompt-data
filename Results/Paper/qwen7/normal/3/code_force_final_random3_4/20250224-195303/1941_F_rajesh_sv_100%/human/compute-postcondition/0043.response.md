Output State: **`max_diff` is the maximum difference found between consecutive elements in the array `A` from index 1 to `n-1`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference found under the same conditions, `index` is the index where `max_diff` was found, `i` is `n`, `diff` is the last calculated difference which is `A[n-1] - A[n-2]`, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, and `right` is `A[index]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the values of `A[index - 1]` to the variable `left` and the value of `A[index]` to the variable `right`. The values of `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `i`, and `diff` remain unchanged from their previous states.
