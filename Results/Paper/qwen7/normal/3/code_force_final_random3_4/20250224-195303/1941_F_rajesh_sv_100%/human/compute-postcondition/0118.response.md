Output State: **`total` is 0, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` is the index of the first element in `D` which is greater than `left - f`, `h` is now `mid`, and `h` and `l` are equal to each other, representing the final boundaries of the search range, and `mid_sum - left >= right - mid_next_sum`.**

Explanation: The code `h = mid` assigns the value of `mid` to `h`. Since `mid` was previously calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`, and `h` and `l` were equal, assigning `h` the value of `mid` does not change their equality. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
