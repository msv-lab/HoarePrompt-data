Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `l` and `h`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `l < h`.

3. **Analyze the loop body**:
   - If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, `h` is set to `mid` and `l` remains unchanged.

4. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to continue, the condition `l < h` must remain true.
   - If `l` is updated to `mid + 1`, then `l` becomes `mid + 1` and `h` remains unchanged.
   - If `h` is set to `mid` and `l` remains unchanged, then `l` remains the same and `h` becomes `mid`.

5. **Consider the current states**:
   - `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`.
   - `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.
   - `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`.

6. **Determine the possible scenarios for the next iteration**:
   - If `l` is updated to `mid + 1`, then `l` must be greater than `h` to exit the loop. However, since we want the loop to continue, `l` should not be greater than `h`.
   - If `h` is set to `mid` and `l` remains unchanged, then `l` must be less than `h` to continue the loop.

Given these points, the only variables that can be adjusted are `l` and `h`. To ensure the loop can continue, `l` must be less than `h`.

Since the loop condition is `l < h`, and given the update rules, the only way to ensure the loop continues is to keep `l` less than `h`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `l` is less than `h`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, and `l` is less than `h`**
