You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and arr is a list of n integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n.
def func_1(n, arr):
    arr.sort()
    new_arr = []
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    while left <= right:
        if left == right:

    #State: Output State: `left` is `n`, `right` is `-1`, and `new_arr` is a list containing all elements from `arr` but in a specific order. Specifically, the elements are appended to `new_arr` in pairs starting from the ends towards the center. If there is an odd number of elements in `arr`, the middle element will be the last element in `new_arr`.
    #
    #To elaborate, the loop continues until `left` exceeds `right`. During each iteration, if `left` equals `right`, the single element at `left` (or `right`) is appended to `new_arr`. Otherwise, the elements at `right` and `left` are appended to `new_arr` in that order. After each iteration, `left` is incremented and `right` is decremented. Once the loop finishes, `left` will be equal to `n` (since it starts at 0 and is incremented until it reaches `n`), `right` will be `-1` (since it starts at `n-1` and is decremented until it goes below 0), and `new_arr` will contain all elements from `arr` in the described order.
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_beauty += abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `max_beauty` is the sum of the absolute differences between every consecutive pair of elements in `new_arr` from index 1 to `n-1`.
    #
    #This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations (from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`), `max_beauty` will hold the total sum of the absolute differences between each adjacent pair of elements in the `new_arr` list.
    return max_beauty
    #The program returns the maximum beauty which is the sum of the absolute differences between every consecutive pair of elements in the `new_arr` list from index 1 to `n-1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `arr` of `n` integers (each between 1 and 10^9). It first sorts the list `arr`. Then, it creates a new list `new_arr` by appending elements from the end and start of the sorted `arr` alternately until all elements are used. If the length of `arr` is odd, the middle element is placed at the end. Finally, it calculates the maximum beauty as the sum of the absolute differences between every consecutive pair of elements in `new_arr` from index 1 to `n-1`, and returns this value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The issue lies in the way the `new_arr` is constructed. The current implementation alternates between the smallest and largest remaining elements, which does not necessarily maximize the beauty. For example, consider the input:

```
3
4
3 4 3 3
```

The program constructs `new_arr` as `[3, 3, 4, 3]`, but the correct construction should be `[3, 3, 3, 4]` to maximize the beauty. This can be achieved by sorting the array and then pairing the smallest and largest elements appropriately. Here's a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(n, arr):
    arr.sort()
    new_arr = []
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    while left <= right:
        new_arr.append(arr[right])
        right -= 1
        if left <= right:
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
            left += 1
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_beauty += abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])
    return max_beauty
```

This corrected function ensures that the maximum beauty is calculated correctly by always pairing the largest and smallest available elements.
