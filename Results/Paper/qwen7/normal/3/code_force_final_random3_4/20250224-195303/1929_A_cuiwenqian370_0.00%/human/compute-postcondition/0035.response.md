Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `max_beauty` is increased by the absolute difference between `new_arr[i]` and `new_arr[i - 1]`.

### Loop Statement
```
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` ranges from 1 to `n-1`.
   - The loop does not directly modify `max_beauty`, but it updates `max_beauty` based on the values in `new_arr`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - After the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, if the loop is to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `i` should be set to `i + 1` from the previous iteration.

### Updated State
- `max_beauty` remains unchanged as it is updated inside the loop body, not directly in the loop head.
- `i` is incremented by 1 from the previous value.

### Final State
- If `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration, then at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

Given the initial condition that `i` was within the range `[1, n-1]`, let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `k`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be `k + 1`.

Since the exact value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is not provided, we can generalize the state as follows:

**State: **`max_beauty` is increased by the absolute difference between `new_arr[i]` and `new_arr[i - 1]`, `i` is `k + 1`, where `k` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration and `k < n - 1`**.
