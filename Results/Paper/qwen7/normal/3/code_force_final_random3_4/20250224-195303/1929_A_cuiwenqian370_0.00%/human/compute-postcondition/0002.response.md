Output State: **`left` is 0, `arr` is a sorted list of n integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n, `new_arr` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The variable `left` is assigned the value 0. The initial state of `arr` and `new_arr` remains unchanged. Therefore, `arr` is still a sorted list of n integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n, and `new_arr` remains an empty list.
