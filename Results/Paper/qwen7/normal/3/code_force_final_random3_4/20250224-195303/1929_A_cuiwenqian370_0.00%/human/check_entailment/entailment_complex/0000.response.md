Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Array Sorting and Rearrangement**:
   - The array `arr` is sorted.
   - A new array `new_arr` is constructed by appending elements from the end and start of the sorted `arr` alternately. This ensures that the largest and smallest elements are paired together, maximizing the positive differences and minimizing the negative ones.
3. **Beauty Calculation**:
   - The beauty is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between every consecutive pair of elements in `new_arr` from index 1 to `n-1`.
   - The logic in the loop correctly computes these differences and sums them up.

Given the problem statement and the provided examples, the approach taken by the program is correct. The rearrangement strategy ensures that the maximum possible beauty is achieved by pairing the largest and smallest available elements at each step.

Correctness: **True**
