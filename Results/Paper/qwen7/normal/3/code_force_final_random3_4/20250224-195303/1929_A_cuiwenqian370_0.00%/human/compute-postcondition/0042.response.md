Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: an integer `n` such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list `arr` of `n` integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n. It returns the maximum beauty, which is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between every consecutive pair of elements in the `new_arr` list from index 1 to `n-1`.**
