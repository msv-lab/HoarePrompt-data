### Reasoning:

The original assessment is incorrect. Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step-by-step.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. To achieve this, we need to strategically arrange the elements of the array.

#### Provided Solution:
The provided solution sorts the array and then constructs a new array by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements. This approach aims to maximize the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

#### Correctness of the Provided Solution:
Let's break down the provided solution:

1. **Sorting the Array**: 
   ```python
   arr.sort()
   ```
   Sorting the array helps in easily accessing the smallest and largest elements.

2. **Constructing `new_arr`**:
   ```python
   new_arr = []
   left = 0
   right = n - 1
   while left <= right:
       if left == right:
           new_arr.append(arr[left])
       else:
           new_arr.append(arr[right])
           new_arr.append(arr[left])
       left += 1
       right -= 1
   ```
   This loop constructs `new_arr` by appending elements from the end and start of the sorted array alternately. If the length of the array is odd, the middle element is placed at the end.

3. **Calculating Maximum Beauty**:
   ```python
   max_beauty = 0
   for i in range(1, n):
       max_beauty += abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])
   ```
   This loop calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.

#### Example Analysis:
Consider the input:
```
3
4
3 4 3 3
```

1. **Sorting the Array**:
   ```python
   arr = [3, 3, 3, 4]
   ```

2. **Constructing `new_arr`**:
   - `left = 0`, `right = 3`
   - Append `arr[3]` (4) -> `new_arr = [4]`
   - Append `arr[0]` (3) -> `new_arr = [4, 3]`
   - `left = 1`, `right = 2`
   - Append `arr[2]` (3) -> `new_arr = [4, 3, 3]`
   - `left = 2`, `right = 1`
   - Append `arr[1]` (3) -> `new_arr = [4, 3, 3, 3]`

3. **Calculating Maximum Beauty**:
   - `max_beauty = |3 - 4| + |3 - 3| + |3 - 3| = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1`

The provided solution correctly maximizes the beauty by ensuring that the largest and smallest elements are paired appropriately.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly states that the provided solution is incorrect. The provided solution correctly maximizes the beauty of the array by sorting the array and then constructing `new_arr` by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
