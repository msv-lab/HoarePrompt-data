Output State: **`left` is 2, `right` must be at least 1, `new_arr` contains the element `arr[right]`**

Explanation: The code appends the element `arr[right]` to the list `new_arr`. Since `right` must be at least 1, the value of `right` is used to access an element from `arr` and append it to `new_arr`. The initial conditions for `left` and the constraint on `right` remain unchanged.
