Output State: **`left` is 2, `right` is at least 1, `new_arr` contains either the element from `arr` at index 2 (if `left` equals `right`), or the elements `arr[1]` and `arr[right]` (if `left` does not equal `right`).**

Explanation: The value of `left` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The value of `right` remains unchanged and is still at least 1. The value of `new_arr` depends on the relationship between `left` and `right`. If `left` equals `right` (which is not the case here since `left` is now 2 and `right` is at least 1), `new_arr` would contain the element from `arr` at index 2. Otherwise, it would contain the elements `arr[1]` and `arr[right]`.
