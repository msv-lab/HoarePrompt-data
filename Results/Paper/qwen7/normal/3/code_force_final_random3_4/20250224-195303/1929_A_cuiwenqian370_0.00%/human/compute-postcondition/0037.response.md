Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the variable `i` and the range `1 to n`. Therefore, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

2. **Determine the Current State of `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `k + 2`.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the State of `i`**: Since `i` starts from `1` and increments by `1` each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `k + 3`.

5. **Ensure the Loop Executes Again**: To ensure the loop executes again, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `k + 3` must be less than `n`.

6. **State Adjustment**: Adjust the state to reflect the new value of `i` and ensure the loop condition is met.

Given these steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`max_beauty` is increased by the absolute difference between `new_arr[i]` and `new_arr[i - 1]`, `i` is `k + 3`**
