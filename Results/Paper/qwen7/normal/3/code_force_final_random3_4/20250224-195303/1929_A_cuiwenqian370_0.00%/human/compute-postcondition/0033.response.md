Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.
2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` in the range `1` to `n`, so the initial value of `i` should be `1`.
3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `left` is `n`
- `right` is `-1`
- `new_arr` contains elements from `arr` in the described order

None of these variables (`left`, `right`, or `new_arr`) are directly involved in the loop head. The only variable that needs adjustment is `i`.

So, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can start executing. Specifically, `i` should be set to `1` (the starting value of the loop) and `i` should be less than `n` for the loop to continue.

**Final State:**
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
