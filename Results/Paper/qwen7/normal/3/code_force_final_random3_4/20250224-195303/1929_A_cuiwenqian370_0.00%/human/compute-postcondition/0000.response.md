Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of n integers where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n.**

Explanation: The `sort()` method sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The precondition that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and each element in `arr` is an integer satisfying 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9 remains valid, but now the elements in `arr` are sorted.
