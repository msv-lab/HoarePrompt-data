Output State: **`left` is 1, `right` must be at least 1, `new_arr` contains the element from `arr` at index 1**

Explanation: The code appends the element from `arr` at index `left` to `new_arr`. Given that `left` is initially 2, after the operation, `left` is decremented to 1 (assuming `left` is decremented before appending). The value at `arr[1]` is appended to `new_arr`. The condition for `right` remains unchanged.
