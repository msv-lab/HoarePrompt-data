Output State: **`left` is 2, `right` is at least 1, `new_arr` is a list containing either the element `arr[1]` (if `left` equals `right`) or the elements `arr[1]` and `arr[1]` (if `left` does not equal `right`).**

Explanation: The value of `left` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The value of `right` remains unchanged and is still at least 1. The list `new_arr` is not affected by this operation and retains its original definition based on the values of `left` and `right`.
