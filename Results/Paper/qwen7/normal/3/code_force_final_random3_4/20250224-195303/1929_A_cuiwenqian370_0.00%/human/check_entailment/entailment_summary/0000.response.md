Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
2. The provided solution sorts the array and then constructs a new array by alternating elements from the start and end of the sorted array.
3. This approach ensures that the largest and smallest elements are placed farthest apart, maximizing the differences between consecutive elements.
4. The logic in the `func_1` function correctly implements this strategy:
   - It sorts the array.
   - It alternates elements from the start and end of the sorted array to form a new array.
   - It calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the new array.
5. The execution summary accurately describes the steps taken by the function, confirming that the approach is correct for maximizing the beauty of the array.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program correctly solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
