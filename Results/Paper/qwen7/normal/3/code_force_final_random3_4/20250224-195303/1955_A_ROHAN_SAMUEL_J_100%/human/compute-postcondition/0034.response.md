Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is the first integer entered.
- `a` is the second integer entered.
- `b` is the third integer entered.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(a * n)
```

Here, the expression `a * n` multiplies the second integer entered (`a`) by the first integer entered (`n`). Since the exact values of `a` and `n` are not specified, we will use their general definitions.

Output: **a * n (where a is the second integer entered and n is the first integer entered)**
