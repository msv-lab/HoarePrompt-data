You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)
        
    #State: Output State: The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` will remain unchanged after all iterations of the loop have finished. The loop processes each set of inputs (`n`, `a`, `b`) independently based on the given conditions and prints the result, but it does not modify the values of `n`, `a`, or `b` within the loop itself. Therefore, after all iterations, `n`, `a`, and `b` retain their original values from the last input provided.
    #
    #In Natural Language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` will be the same as the values of the last set of inputs provided to the loop. The loop does not alter these values; it only uses them to perform calculations and prints the results.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \). For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on specific conditions. The function does not modify the input values \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \) across different test cases. After processing all test cases, the final values of \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \) are the same as the values of the last set of inputs provided.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the promotion price for two yogurts (b) is less than twice the regular price for one yogurt (2a), but the total number of yogurts (n) is even. In such a case, Maxim should buy all yogurts at the promotion price, which is not handled by the current implementation.

For example, consider the input:
```
2
4 5 10
```
Here, `n = 4`, `a = 5`, and `b = 10`. According to the problem description, the optimal way to buy 4 yogurts would be to buy them all at the promotion price, resulting in a total cost of `4 * 5 / 2 * 10 = 20` burles. However, the program incorrectly calculates the cost as follows:

- For `n % 2 == 0` and `2 * a >= b`, it prints `n // 2 * b`, which in this case is `4 // 2 * 10 = 20`.

This is actually correct in this specific case, but the issue arises in other scenarios. Consider another input:
```
2
4 5 8
```
Here, `n = 4`, `a = 5`, and `b = 8`. The optimal way to buy 4 yogurts would be to buy them all at the promotion price, resulting in a total cost of `4 * 5 / 2 * 8 = 20` burles. However, the program incorrectly calculates the cost as follows:

- For `n % 2 == 0` and `2 * a < b`, it prints `a * n`, which in this case is `5 * 4 = 20`.

The program does not handle the general case where the promotion price is less than twice the regular price and the number of yogurts is even. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
