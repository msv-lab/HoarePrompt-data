### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step using the provided annotations and the original assessment.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program checks if `n` is odd (`n % 2`).
     - If `n` is odd, it further checks whether buying two yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper than buying each yogurt individually.
       - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying each yogurt individually is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
       - Otherwise, it calculates the cost by buying as many pairs as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurt at the individual price.
         - The cost is calculated as `n // 2 * b + a`.
   - If `n` is even, it directly checks whether buying two yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper than buying each yogurt individually.
     - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying each yogurt individually is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, it calculates the cost by buying all pairs at the promotion price.
       - The cost is calculated as `n // 2 * b`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum cost for each test case.

### Verification with Examples:

Let's verify the program with the provided examples again:

#### Example 1:
- Input:
  ```
  2 5 9
  ```
- Output:
  ```
  9
  ```
- Explanation:
  - `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Since `n` is even and `2 * a = 10 > 9`, the cost is `2 * 5 = 10`. The output should be `10`, not `9`.

#### Example 2:
- Input:
  ```
  3 5 9
  ```
- Output:
  ```
  14
  ```
- Explanation:
  - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Since `n` is odd and `2 * a = 10 > 9`, the cost is `3 * 5 = 15`. The output should be `15`, not `14`.

#### Example 3:
- Input:
  ```
  3 5 11
  ```
- Output:
  ```
  15
  ```
- Explanation:
  - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - Since `n` is odd and `2 * a = 10 < 11`, the cost is `2 * 11 + 5 = 22 + 5 = 27`. The output should be `27`, not `15`.

#### Example 4:
- Input:
  ```
  4 5 11
  ```
- Output:
  ```
  20
  ```
- Explanation:
  - `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - Since `n` is even and `2 * a = 10 < 11`, the cost is `4 * 5 = 20`. The output is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program has logical errors in handling the cases where `n` is odd and `2 * a < b`. Specifically, the cost calculation for odd `n` when `2 * a < b` is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

### Detailed Explanation:
The program fails to correctly calculate the minimum cost when `n` is odd and `2 * a < b`. The logic for calculating the cost when `n` is odd and `2 * a < b` should be:
- Buy as many pairs as possible at the promotion price.
- Buy the remaining yogurt(s) at the individual price.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print((n // 2) * b + a)
        else:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the cost is calculated correctly for both even and odd values of `n`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
