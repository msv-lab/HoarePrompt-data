Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's execution directly.
   - The key variable here is the result of `int(input())`, which determines how many times the loop will run.

3. **Initial State Before the Loop:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - This means `t` represents the number of test cases, and the loop will run `t` times.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must match the value of `t`.
   - Therefore, the state before the loop should reflect that `int(input())` will return a value within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

5. **Final State:**
   - Since the loop will run `t` times, `int(input())` must be equal to `t`.

**State:**
**`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and `int(input())` must be equal to `t`**
