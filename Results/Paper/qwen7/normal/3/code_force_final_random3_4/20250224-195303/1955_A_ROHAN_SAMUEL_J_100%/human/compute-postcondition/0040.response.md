Output State: The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` will remain unchanged after all iterations of the loop have finished. The loop processes each set of inputs (`n`, `a`, `b`) independently based on the given conditions and prints the result, but it does not modify the values of `n`, `a`, or `b` within the loop itself. Therefore, after all iterations, the original values of `n`, `a`, and `b` from each input will still be the same as when they were initially provided.

In Natural Language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` will not have been altered. Each set of inputs is processed individually, and the results are printed, but the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` retain their original values from each input provided.
