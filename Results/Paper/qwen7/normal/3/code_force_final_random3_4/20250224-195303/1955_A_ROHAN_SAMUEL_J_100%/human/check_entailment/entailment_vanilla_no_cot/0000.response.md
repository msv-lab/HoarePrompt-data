Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a flaw in how it handles the cases where `n` is even and the promotion price (`b`) is less than twice the regular price (`2*a`). Specifically, the logic for even `n` does not correctly account for the possibility of using the promotion to minimize cost.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        else:
            # If n is even, use the promotion as much as possible
            full_sets = n // 2
            remaining = n % 2
            total_cost = full_sets * b + remaining * a
            print(total_cost)

```

This corrected version ensures that when `n` is even, the function calculates the cost by maximizing the use of the promotion while also accounting for any remaining yogurts that cannot be part of a promotion set.
