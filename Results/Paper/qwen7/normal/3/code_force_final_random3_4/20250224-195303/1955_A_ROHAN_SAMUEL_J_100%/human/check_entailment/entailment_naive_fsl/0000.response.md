Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the promotion price for two yogurts (b) is less than twice the regular price for one yogurt (2a), but the total number of yogurts (n) is even. In such a case, Maxim should buy all yogurts at the promotion price, which is not handled by the current implementation.

For example, consider the input:
```
2
4 5 10
```
Here, `n = 4`, `a = 5`, and `b = 10`. According to the problem description, the optimal way to buy 4 yogurts would be to buy them all at the promotion price, resulting in a total cost of `4 * 5 / 2 * 10 = 20` burles. However, the program incorrectly calculates the cost as follows:

- For `n % 2 == 0` and `2 * a >= b`, it prints `n // 2 * b`, which in this case is `4 // 2 * 10 = 20`.

This is actually correct in this specific case, but the issue arises in other scenarios. Consider another input:
```
2
4 5 8
```
Here, `n = 4`, `a = 5`, and `b = 8`. The optimal way to buy 4 yogurts would be to buy them all at the promotion price, resulting in a total cost of `4 * 5 / 2 * 8 = 20` burles. However, the program incorrectly calculates the cost as follows:

- For `n % 2 == 0` and `2 * a < b`, it prints `a * n`, which in this case is `5 * 4 = 20`.

The program does not handle the general case where the promotion price is less than twice the regular price and the number of yogurts is even. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
