You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer; for each test case, n and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5; c is a list of n positive integers where each element is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive; for each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is equal to `n`, `x` is 1 if `a[n]` is greater than 1 else `x` is 2, `b[n]` is the sum of `b[0]` and the sequence of `x` values added up from `i=1` to `i=n`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the input integer `n`. The variable `x` will be 1 if the last element of the list `a` (i.e., `a[n]`) is greater than 1, otherwise it will be 2. The list `b` will have its final value at index `n` as the cumulative sum of `x` starting from `b[0]` and adding `x` for each iteration from `i=1` to `i=n`.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    print(*a)
    #This is printed: 1 3 6 10
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: q is a positive integer decremented by the number of times the loop has executed, x and y are input integers for each iteration, and the program prints 'NO' if a[y] - a[x - 1] is less than b[y] - b[x - 1] or if x equals y, otherwise it prints 'YES'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list of integers `a` and handles a series of queries. It first calculates a cumulative sum list `b` based on the values in `a`. Then, for each query, it compares the sum of a specified sublist in `a` with a corresponding value derived from `b`, and prints 'YES' if the sum in `a` is greater than or equal to the value from `b`, or 'NO' otherwise.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a subarray is good according to the given problem description. Specifically, the program does not check if there exists an array \( b \) that satisfies the conditions mentioned in the problem statement. Instead, it seems to be calculating prefix sums and comparing them, which does not address the core requirement of finding an array \( b \) that meets the specified conditions.

To illustrate, consider the following example:

- Input:
```
1
5 4
1 2 1 4 5
1 5
4 4
3 4
1 3
```

- Expected Output:
```
YES
NO
YES
NO
```

However, the provided program will output:
```
1 3 4 8 13
NO
NO
NO
NO
```

This is incorrect because the program does not verify if the subarray can be transformed into a good array \( b \) as described. For instance, the subarray `[1, 2, 1, 4, 5]` can be transformed into `[2, 1, 3, 4, 1]` (where each element is different and positive), making it a good array. The program fails to check this condition, leading to incorrect results.
