Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` is an input integer
   - `x` is 1 if `a[1]` is greater than 1 else `x` is 2
   - `b[1]` is `b[0]` + `x`

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The loop starts with `i` set to 1 and goes up to `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - Since `i` is incremented within the loop, it will become 2 at the start of the next iteration.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is an input integer.
   - `x` is determined by the value of `a[1]` and does not change within the loop.
   - `b[1]` is already updated based on the value of `x` from the previous iteration.

5. **Updated States for the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be 2.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `x` remains the same.
   - `b[1]` remains the same.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `x` is 1 if `a[1]` is greater than 1 else `x` is 2, `b[1]` is `b[0]` + `x`**
