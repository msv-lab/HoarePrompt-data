### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - Reads an integer `n` and a list `p` of length `n` from the input.
   - Constructs a list `v` of length `n+1` initialized to 0, and updates it with the values from the input list `p`.
   - Checks if there exists an index `i` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. If such an index is found, it prints `2` and returns.
   - If no such index is found, it prints `3`.

2. **Handling the Case Where No Pair Can Attend Together**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     3
     2 3 1
     ```
   - The program constructs the list `v` as follows:
     - `v[1] = 2`
     - `v[2] = 3`
     - `v[3] = 1`
   - The program then checks if there exists an index `i` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`:
     - For `i = 1`: `v[v[v[1]]] = v[v[2]] = v[3] = 1` (True)
     - For `i = 2`: `v[v[v[2]]] = v[v[3]] = v[1] = 2` (True)
     - For `i = 3`: `v[v[v[3]]] = v[v[1]] = v[2] = 3` (True)

   - Since all indices satisfy the condition `v[v[v[i]]] == i`, the program prints `2`.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The program correctly identifies that if there exists any index `i` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`, then at least two friends can attend the party together. This is because `v[v[v[i]]] == i` implies that both `i` and `v[i]` receive invitations, ensuring that both friends attend.
   - However, the program fails to handle the case where no such index exists. In the example provided:
     ```
     3
     2 3 1
     ```
   - No pair of friends can attend the party together. The program incorrectly prints `2` instead of `3`, which is the correct answer.

Given the analysis, the program does not correctly handle the case where no pair of friends can attend the party together. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
