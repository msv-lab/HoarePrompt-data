Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n` (inclusive), so the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be between 2 and 50 inclusive
   - `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i`

4. **Determine the next value of `i`**: Since `i` starts at 1 and the loop increments `i` by 1 each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `2`.

5. **Check the condition for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`. Given that `i` is now `2`, the condition `i <= n` will hold true as long as `n` is at least `2`.

6. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be `2`
   - `n` must still be between 2 and 50 inclusive
   - The condition `v[v[v[i]]]` is not equal to `i` remains unchanged because it does not depend on `i` directly but rather on the values within the array `v`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be between 2 and 50 inclusive, and `v[v[v[2]]]` is not equal to 2**
