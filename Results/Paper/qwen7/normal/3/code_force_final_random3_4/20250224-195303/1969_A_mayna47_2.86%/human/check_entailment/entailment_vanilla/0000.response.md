### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Friend Best Friend Mapping**: In `func_1`, it correctly initializes a list `v` to store the best friend mapping and updates it with the input values.
3. **Special Case for Two Friends**: For `n = 2`, the program correctly prints `2` because both friends need to be invited to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.
4. **Checking for Direct Pairings**: The program checks if there exists a pair `(i, v[v[i]])` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. If such a pair exists, it means inviting both friends in this pair will ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. In this case, the program prints `2`.
5. **General Case**: If no direct pairings exist, the program prints `3`, which is the correct answer based on the problem statement and examples provided.

Given the above points, the program logic appears to be correct according to the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly handles all the given scenarios and examples provided in the problem statement.
