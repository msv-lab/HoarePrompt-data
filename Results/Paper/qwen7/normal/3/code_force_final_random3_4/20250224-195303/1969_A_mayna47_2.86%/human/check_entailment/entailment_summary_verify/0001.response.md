### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Friend Best Friend Mapping**: In `func_1`, it correctly initializes a list `v` to store the best friend mapping and updates it with the input values.
3. **Special Case for Two Friends**: For `n = 2`, the program correctly prints `2` because both friends need to be invited to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.
4. **Checking for Direct Pairings**: The program checks if there exists a pair `(i, v[v[i]])` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. If such a pair exists, it means inviting both friends in this pair will ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. In this case, the program prints `2`.
5. **General Case**: If no direct pairings exist, the program prints `3`, which is the correct answer based on the problem statement and examples provided.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of checking for direct pairings. Specifically, the condition `v[v[v[i]]] == i` is not sufficient to guarantee that both friends in the pair will attend the party. This condition only checks if the sequence of best friends returns to the original friend, but it does not ensure that both friends in the pair receive invitations.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following example:
- Input: `n = 4`, `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`
- Constructed list `v`: `[0, 2, 3, 4, 1]`
- Checking for direct pairings:
  - For `i = 1`, `v[v[v[1]]] = v[v[2]] = v[3] = 4`, which does not equal `1`.
  - For `i = 2`, `v[v[v[2]]] = v[v[3]] = v[4] = 1`, which equals `2`.

Based on the current logic, the program would print `3` for this case, but it should print `2` because inviting friends `1` and `2` would ensure that both friends in the pair `(1, 2)` and `(2, 3)` come to the party.

Therefore, the original assessment is **inaccurate** because the program does not correctly handle cases where direct pairings exist.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
