Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Function `func_1` is not being called with the correct parameters**: The function `func_1` should be called with the appropriate parameters from the main loop. The current implementation of `func_1` does not take any arguments, but it should process the input for each test case.

2. **Incorrect logic for determining the minimum number of invitations**:
   - The condition `if v[v[v[i]]] == i:` checks if the triple relationship forms a cycle of length 3, which is not always the optimal solution.
   - The logic for handling cases where the minimum number of invitations needed is 2 or 3 is flawed.

3. **Handling of the base case**:
   - For `n == 2`, the program prints 2, which is correct, but the logic for larger `n` values needs to be more robust.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Check if there are any cycles of length 2
    for i in range(n):
        if v[v[i]] == i:
            print(2)
            break
    else:
        # If no cycle of length 2, check for cycles of length 3
        for i in range(n):
            if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            # If no cycles of length 2 or 3, we need at least 3 invitations
            print(3)
```

This corrected version properly handles the different scenarios and ensures that the minimum number of invitations is calculated correctly.
