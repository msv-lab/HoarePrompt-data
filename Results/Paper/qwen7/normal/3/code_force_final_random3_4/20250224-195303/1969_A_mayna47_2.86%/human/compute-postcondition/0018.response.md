Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is between 2 and 50 inclusive.
   - `v[v[v[2]]]` is not equal to 2.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`. Therefore, the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless modified within the loop body, but since no modification is mentioned, `n` stays the same.
   - The value of `v[v[v[2]]]` remains unchanged because the loop body is omitted and no operation affects this value.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` is 3.
- `n` is still between 2 and 50 inclusive.
- `v[v[v[2]]]` is still not equal to 2.

State: **`i` is 3, `n` is between 2 and 50 inclusive, and `v[v[v[2]]]` is not equal to 2**
