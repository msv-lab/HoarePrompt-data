Postcondition: `nx` is a string, `j` is equal to `n`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3. If the element at index `j-1` in the list `xx[i]` is not `'?'`, then `nx` is the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`. If the element at index `j-1` in the list `xx[i]` is `'?'`, then `nx` is `'F'`. Additionally, if either `i` is in the range `sb[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in the range `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` is a string with the last character 'S' added.
