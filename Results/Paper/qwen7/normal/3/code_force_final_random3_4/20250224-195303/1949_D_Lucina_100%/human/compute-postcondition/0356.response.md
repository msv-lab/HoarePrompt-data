Output State: **`nx` is either 'S' or 'F' plus the value of `xx[i][1]`, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2**.

This means that the value of `nx` has been updated by adding the value of `xx[i][1]` (where `xx[i][1]` refers to the element at index `j-1` of the list `xx[i]`) to its original value ('S' or 'F'). The other variables (`i`, `n`, and `j`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
