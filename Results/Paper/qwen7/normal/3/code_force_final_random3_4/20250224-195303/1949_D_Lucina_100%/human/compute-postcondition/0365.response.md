Output State: **`nx` is either 'SS' or 'FS', `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 3**

Explanation: The variable `nx` was either 'S' or 'F'. After executing `nx += 'S'`, `nx` becomes either 'SS' (if `nx` was originally 'S') or 'FS' (if `nx` was originally 'F'). The increment operation on `i` and the condition that `n` is greater than or equal to 1 remain unchanged, and `j` remains 3.
