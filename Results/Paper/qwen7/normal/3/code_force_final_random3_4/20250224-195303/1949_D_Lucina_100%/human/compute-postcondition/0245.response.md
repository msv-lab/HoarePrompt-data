Output State: **`nx` is a string that is the concatenation of its original value ('F' or 'S') and the character at position `j - 1` in `xx[i]`; `i` is `n + 1`; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; the character at position `j + 1` in `xx[i]` is either not `'?'` or `'?'`; and if either `i` or `j + 1` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.**

Explanation: The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` appends the character at position `j - 1` in `xx[i]` to the string `nx`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The conditions regarding the values of `nx`, `i`, `n`, and the character at position `j + 1` in `xx[i]` also remain valid.
