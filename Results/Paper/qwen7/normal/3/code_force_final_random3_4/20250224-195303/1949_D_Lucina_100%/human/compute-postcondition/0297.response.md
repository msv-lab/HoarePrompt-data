Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `nx` is a string.
   - `j` is `n + 1`.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for j in range(1, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Adjusting States:**
   - The loop variable `j` starts from 1 and goes up to `n + 1` (exclusive).
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `n + 1`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented from `n + 1` to `n + 2`.
   - Since `j` is incremented within the loop, the new value of `j` will be `n + 2`.

5. **Other Variables:**
   - `nx`: Its value is determined by the loop body, but it does not change based on the loop head.
   - `n`: It remains unchanged as per the loop head.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The only variable that changes in the loop head is `j`, which will be `n + 2` for the next iteration.
   - `nx` and `n` remain the same as they are not directly affected by the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`nx` is a string, `j` is `n + 2`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**
