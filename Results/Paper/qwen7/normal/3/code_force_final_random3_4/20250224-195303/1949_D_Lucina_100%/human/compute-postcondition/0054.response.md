Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - The postcondition includes the effects of the loop body based on the value of `x[0]`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for j in range(1, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Body Effects:**
   - If `x[0]` is 'F':
     - `a[j]` is increased by 1
     - `x[0]` remains 'F'
     - `a[i]` is increased by 1
   - If `x[0]` is not 'F':
     - If `x[0]` is 'S':
       - `b[j]` is incremented by 1
     - Otherwise, no changes occur.

4. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop starts with `j = 1` and increments `j` by 1 in each iteration.
   - Since `j` starts at 1 and the loop condition is `range(1, n + 1)`, the next value of `j` will be 2.
   - Therefore, we need to update `j` to 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop body.

5. **Postcondition for the Next Iteration:**
   - `j` should be 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 0 (unchanged).

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`j` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0**
