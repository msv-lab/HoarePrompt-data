Output State: **`xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', `i` is an index within the range of `xx`, and `j - 1` is an index within the range of `xx[i]`; `nx` is 'F'**.

Explanation: The code `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. Since `nx` was not previously defined, it is initialized to 'F'. The values of `xx[i][j - 1]`, `i`, and `j - 1` remain unchanged from their initial state. The conditions about `i` and `j` being within certain ranges of `sa` also remain valid.
