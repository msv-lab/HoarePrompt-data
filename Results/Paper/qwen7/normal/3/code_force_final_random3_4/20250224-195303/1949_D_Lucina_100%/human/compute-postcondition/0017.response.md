Postcondition: `n` must be within the range 2 to 24. If the element at index `j-1` of the array `x` is 'F', then `a[i]` and `a[j]` are each incremented by 1. If the element at index `j-1` of the array `x` is 'S', then `b[i]` and `b[j]` are each incremented by 1. If the element at index `j-1` of the array `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', there is no change in the values of `a[i]`, `a[j]`, `b[i]`, and `b[j]`.
