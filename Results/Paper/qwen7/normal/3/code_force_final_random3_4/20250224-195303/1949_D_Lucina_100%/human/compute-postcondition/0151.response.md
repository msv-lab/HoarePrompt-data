Output State: **`i` is 4; `n` must be greater than 4; `sa` is a list containing 1, 3, and 4**

The code `sa.append(i)` appends the value of `i`, which is 4, to the list `sa`. Initially, `sa` contains the elements 1 and 3. After appending 4, `sa` becomes a list containing 1, 3, and 4. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
