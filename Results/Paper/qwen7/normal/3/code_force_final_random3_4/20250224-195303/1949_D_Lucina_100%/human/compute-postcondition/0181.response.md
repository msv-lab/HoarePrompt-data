Output State: **`nx` is 'S'**.

Explanation: The initial state does not provide a specific value for `nx`. However, the code snippet `nx += 'S'` indicates that `nx` is being updated by concatenating the string `'S'` to its current value. Since no initial value is given, we assume `nx` was initially an empty string or non-existent, and after executing the code, `nx` becomes `'S'`.
