Output State: **`nx` is the string 'xx[i][j - 1]', `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and the current value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to the end of the string `nx`. Since `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', `nx` becomes the string formed by appending `xx[i][j - 1]` to the existing value of `nx`. The values of `i`, `n`, and the condition about `xx[i][j - 1]` remain unchanged.
