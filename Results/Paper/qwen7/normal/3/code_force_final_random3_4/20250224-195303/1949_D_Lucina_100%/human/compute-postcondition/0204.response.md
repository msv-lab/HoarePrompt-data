Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `nx` is a string.
- `n` must be at least 1.
- The condition `xx[i][j - 1]` is either not equal to '?' with `nx` being the sum of its previous value and the element at index `[i][j - 1]` of `xx`, or equal to '?' with `nx` being the string 'F' appended to its previous value if either `i` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, otherwise `nx` is 'S'.

### Loop Head:
```
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop variable `j` starts from 1 and goes up to `n`.
- The loop does not modify `nx` or `n` directly within the loop body (since the loop body is omitted).
- The only variable that changes within the loop body would be `j`.

### Adjusting States:
- Since the loop increments `j` by 1 each time it runs, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `j + 1`.
- The other variables (`nx` and `n`) remain unchanged unless modified within the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, they stay the same.

### New State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `nx` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

### Conclusion:
Since the loop body is omitted, no changes are made to `nx` or `n`. The only change is to `j`.

**Final State:**
- `nx` is the same string as before.
- `n` is the same integer as before.
- `j` is `j + 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `nx` is a string.
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `j` is `j + 1`.

So, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`nx` is a string, `n` must be at least 1, and `j` is `j + 1`**.
