Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is set to `i_end + 2`, `j` is `j_end + 1`, and `a[i]` is incremented by 1.**

The code `a[i] += 1` increments the value of `a[i]` by 1. Given the initial state, the only change is to the value of `a[i]`. The conditions and values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The condition `x[j - 1] != 'F'` must still hold true, which means that the character at index `j - 1` in the list `x` is not 'F'.
