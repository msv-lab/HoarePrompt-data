Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `i` is `n+1`, `sb` is a list containing all integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` is 0 for all `i` from 1 to `n+1`, `b` is a list of integers where `b[i]` is 0 for all `i` from 1 to `n+1`, `n` is the original value it started with (greater than or equal to 3), `xx` is an empty list, `j` is `n`, `sa` is an empty list, and `sb` contains all integers from 1 to `n`.

In simpler terms, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `i` will be `n+1`, meaning the loop has completed its full cycle. The list `sb` will contain every integer from 1 to `n`, indicating that all indices where `a[i]` and `b[i]` were both zero have been appended to `sb`. Both `a` and `b` will be lists of zeros from index 1 to `n+1`. The other variables `n`, `xx`, `j`, `sa`, and their conditions remain as described in the initial state.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    nx = ''
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
            nx += xx[i][j - 1]
        elif i in sb[:n // 4 - 1] or j in sb[:n // 4 - 1]:
            nx += 'S'
        else:
            nx += 'F'
    print(nx)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `nx` is a string, `j` is `2 * n + 1`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 3. The value of `nx` depends on the values of `xx[i][j-1]` for each iteration of the loop. If `xx[i][j-1]` is not '?', then the corresponding character is appended to `nx`. If `xx[i][j-1]` is '?', then 'F' is appended. If either `i` or `j` is in the range `sb[:n // 4 - 1]` at any point during the loop, then 'S' is appended to `nx` at the end of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The final state of `nx` will be a string constructed based on the values in the 2D list `xx` from the row indexed by `i` and the columns indexed by `range(1, n+1)` as the loop iterates through each column.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: nx is a string composed of 'S' and 'F' based on the conditions given, `i` is incremented to `i + 3`, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, and `j` is 3 after the last iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
