Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in range(1, n + 1):`. The variables involved in this loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is within the range defined by `range(1, n + 1)`. This means `j` must be less than or equal to `n`.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**: 
   - `n` must be within the range 2 to 24.
   - The value of `j` is not explicitly stated, but it is the last value processed in the previous iteration.

4. **Next Iteration Analysis**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 from its current value.
   - The new value of `j` should be within the range defined by `range(1, n + 1)`, meaning `j` must still be less than or equal to `n`.

5. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, the new value of `j` will be the previous value of `j` plus 1.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise in the loop body, but since no such change is mentioned, `n` stays the same.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `j` and the unchanged value of `n`.

**State:**
- `n` must be within the range 2 to 24 (unchanged).
- `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.

If we denote the previous value of `j` as `j_prev`, then the new value of `j` will be `j_prev + 1`.

Since the exact value of `j` is not provided, let's assume `j_prev` was the last value processed in the previous iteration. For the sake of clarity, if `j_prev` was, say, 5 (this is an assumption for illustration purposes), then the new value of `j` would be 6.

**Final State:**
State: **`n` must be within the range 2 to 24, `j` is 6**.

However, without the exact previous value of `j`, the most general form would be:

**State:**
State: **`n` must be within the range 2 to 24, `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value**.
