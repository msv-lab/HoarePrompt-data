Output State: **`nx` is 'S' + the original string, `n` must be at least 1, and `j` is `j + 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `nx` is a string, and the code appends the character 'S' to `nx`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it must be at least 1, and the value of `j` is incremented by 1 but retains its updated form (`j + 1`).
