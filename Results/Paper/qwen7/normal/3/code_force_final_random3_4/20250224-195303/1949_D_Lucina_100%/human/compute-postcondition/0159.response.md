Output State: **`xx` is a 2D list where `xx[i][j-1]` is not equal to '?'; `nx` is equal to the previous value of `nx` plus the value of `xx[i][j-1]`.**

This means that the value of `nx` has been updated by adding the value of `xx[i][j-1]` to its previous value, while the 2D list `xx` remains unchanged with the condition that `xx[i][j-1]` is not equal to '?'.
