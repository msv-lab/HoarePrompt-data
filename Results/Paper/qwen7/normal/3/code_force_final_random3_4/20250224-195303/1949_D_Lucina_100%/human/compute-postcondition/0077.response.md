Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `j`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `j`**: The loop starts with `j` set to 1.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

4. **Identify the states that need adjustment**: We need to ensure that the loop can start and continue executing. This means we need to adjust the initial value of `j` and the value of `n`.

5. **Consider the given states**:
   - `a[i]` holds the total count of 'F' characters in the string `x`.
   - `b[i]` holds the total count of 'S' characters in the string `x`.
   - `xx` is a list containing the string `x`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is set to `i_end + 2`.
   - `x` is the input string from the user.

6. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `j` starts at 1, no adjustment is needed for `j` itself.
   - However, the loop will continue as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, `n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0) for the loop to execute.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is set to `i_end + 2`**
