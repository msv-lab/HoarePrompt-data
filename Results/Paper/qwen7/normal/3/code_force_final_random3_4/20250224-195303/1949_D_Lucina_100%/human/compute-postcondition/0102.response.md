Output State: **`b[j]` is incremented by 1, `i` is set to `i_end + 2`, `j` is `j_end + 2`, and the condition `x[j - 1] != 'F'` still holds true.**

Explanation: The code snippet `b[j] += 1` increments the value of `b[j]` by 1. The values of `i`, `j`, and the condition `x[j - 1] != 'F'` remain unchanged from their initial states.
