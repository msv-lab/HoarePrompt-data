Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - From the given state before the loop, `i` will be `n + 1`.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 24\).

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, at the start of the loop, `i` should be within the range `[1, n]`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `i` starts at `n + 1`, it does not satisfy the condition `i <= n` initially. Hence, the loop will not execute.
   - To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust `i` to be within the range `[1, n]`.

5. **Final State**:
   - `i` must be set to `1` (the smallest value in the range) to ensure the loop can start.
   - `n` remains as it is, but its value must still be within the specified range.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24**
