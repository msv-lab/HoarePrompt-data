Output State: **`j` is 1; `n` must be greater than 0; the current value of `a[j]` is increased by 1; the current value of `x[0]` is 'F'; `a[i]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code `a[j] += 1` increments the value of `a[j]` by 1. Given that `j` is initially 1, the value of `a[1]` is increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
