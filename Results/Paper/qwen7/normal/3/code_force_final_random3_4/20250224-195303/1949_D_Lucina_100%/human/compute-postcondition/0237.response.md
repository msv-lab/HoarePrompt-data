Output State: **`nx` is now a string that is the concatenation of its original value ('F' or 'S') and the character at position `j-1` in `xx[i]`; `i` is `n + 1`; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; the character at position `j` in `xx[i]` is either not '?' or '?'; and if either `i` or `j` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` is 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.**

This means that the variable `nx` has been updated by appending the character at position `j-1` in the string `xx[i]` to its current value. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
