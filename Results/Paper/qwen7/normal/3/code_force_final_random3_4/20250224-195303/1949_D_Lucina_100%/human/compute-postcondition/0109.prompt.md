Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length n+1 filled with zeros; `b` is a list of length n+1 filled with zeros; `xx` is a list containing one element which is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    x = input()
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if x[j - 1] == 'F':
            a[i] += 1
            a[j] += 1
        elif x[j - 1] == 'S':
            b[i] += 1
            b[j] += 1
    xx.append(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `xx` is a list containing the string `x`; `a[i]` and `a[j]` remain unchanged and represent the total occurrences of 'F' in the string `x`; `b[i]` and `b[j]` remain unchanged and represent the total occurrences of 'S' in the string `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop completes, `a[i]` will hold the total count of 'F' characters in the string `x`, and `b[i]` will hold the total count of 'S' characters in the string `x`; `xx` is a list containing the string `x`; `n` remains unchanged; `i` is set to `i_end + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is set to `i_end + 2`, and `j` is equal to `n`. The condition `x[j - 1] != 'F'` holds true. If `x[j - 1]` is 'F', then `a[j]` is incremented by 1. If `x[j - 1]` is 'S', then `b[j]` is incremented by 1; `xx` is appended with the list `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
