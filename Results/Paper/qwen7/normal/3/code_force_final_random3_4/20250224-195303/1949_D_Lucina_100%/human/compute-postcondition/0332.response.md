Output State: **`xx` is a 2D list, `i` is the same as before, `j` is `j + 1`, `nx` is the string that was previously either concatenated with the value of `xx[i][j]` if it is not '?', or appended with 'S' or 'F' based on whether `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sb`, and now `nx` has been further appended with 'S'.**

This means that the string `nx` has been updated by appending the character 'S' to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.
