Postcondition: `nx` is a string. If the character `xx[i][j-1]` is not '?', then `nx` is the original string plus the character `xx[i][j-1]`, and `n` must be at least 1, with `j` incremented by 1. If `i` is in the first quarter of `sa` (excluding the last element) or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa` (excluding the last element), then `nx` is the original string plus 'F', and `n` must be at least 1, with `j` incremented by 1. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S' followed by the original string value of `nx`, and `j` is incremented by 1.
