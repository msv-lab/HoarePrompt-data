Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Transition Videos**: The code attempts to categorize scenarios into `sa` (for scenarios with more funny transitions) and `sb` (for scenarios with more scary transitions). However, the logic to decide whether a `?` should be replaced with `F` or `S` is flawed. Specifically, the conditions used to decide the type of transition video are not aligned with the requirement to ensure no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type for any permutation of scenarios.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Decision Making**: The decision-making process for assigning `F` or `S` to `?` values is overly simplistic and does not consider the global constraint of ensuring no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type. For example, the code suggests assigning `F` or `S` based on the count of `F` and `S` in the initial input, which does not guarantee the required property for all permutations.

3. **Incomplete Consideration of Constraints**: The code does not fully consider the constraints and requirements of the problem. For instance, it does not handle the case where the number of `F` and `S` values is balanced or nearly balanced, which is crucial for ensuring the solution works for all permutations.

A correct solution would involve a more sophisticated algorithm to ensure that the constraints are met for all possible permutations of the scenarios. This might include using graph theory concepts or dynamic programming to find an optimal assignment of `F` and `S` to `?` values while respecting the given constraints.
