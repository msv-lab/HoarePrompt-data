Postcondition: `nx` is a string, `j` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, and the element at index `j-1` in the list `xx[i]` is either not `'?'` (in which case `nx` is the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`) or `'?'` (in which case `nx` is a string with the last character 'S' added if either `i` is in the range `sb[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in the range `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, otherwise `nx` is 'F').
