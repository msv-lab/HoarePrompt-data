Postcondition: `xx` is a 2D list, `i` and `j` are indices within `xx`, `nx` is updated based on the following conditions: if the value at `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is incremented by the value at `xx[i][j - 1]`. If the value at `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', then `nx` is set to 'S' if either `i` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`; otherwise, `nx` is set to 'F'.
