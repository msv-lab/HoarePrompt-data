Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `x` is an input string**.

Explanation: The variable `x` is assigned the value of the input provided by the user, which is treated as a string since no type conversion is specified. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
