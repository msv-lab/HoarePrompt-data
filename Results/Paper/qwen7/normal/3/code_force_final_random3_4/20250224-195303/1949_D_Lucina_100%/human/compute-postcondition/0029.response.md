Output State: **`a[i]` is increased by 1, `a[j]` is increased by 1, `a[j_prev + 1]` remains unchanged, `b[j_prev + 1]` remains unchanged, `b[i]` remains unchanged**.

This means that the value of `a[i]` has been increased by 1, and now `a[j]` has also been increased by 1 (assuming `j` was not previously defined or modified in the context of this snippet). The other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
