Output State: **`nx` is a string with the last character 'S' added, `j` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, and the element at index `j-1` in the list `xx[i]` is `'?'`. Additionally, either `i` is in the range `sb[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in the range `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`**.

This means that the string `nx` now ends with 'S', while the conditions involving `j`, `n`, the list `xx[i]`, and the range `sb` remain unchanged from the initial state.
