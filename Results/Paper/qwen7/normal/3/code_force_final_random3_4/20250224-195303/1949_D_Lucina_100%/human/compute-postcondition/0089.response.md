Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in this case are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is set to `i_end + 2`.
   - The condition `x[j - 1] != 'F'` holds true.

4. **Analyze the loop body**:
   - If `x[j - 1]` is 'F', then `a[j]` is incremented by 1.
   - If `x[j - 1]` is 'S', then `b[j]` is incremented by 1.
   - If `x[j - 1]` is neither 'F' nor 'S', the values of `n`, `i`, and the condition `x[j - 1] != 'F'` remain unchanged.

5. **Determine the state at the start of the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` will be `j_end + 1` (where `j_end` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration).
   - The condition `x[j - 1] != 'F'` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

Given these points, let's formulate the new state:

- `n` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `i` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
- `j` is incremented by 1, so it becomes `j_end + 1`.
- The condition `x[j - 1] != 'F'` must still hold true.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is set to `i_end + 2`, `j` is `j_end + 1`, and the condition `x[j - 1] != 'F'` must still hold true.**
