Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is 1, `sb` is an empty list, `a` is a list of integers where `a[i]` is 0 for all `i` from 1 to `n+1`, `b` is a list of integers where `b[i] is 0 for all `i` from 1 to `n+1`, `n` is the original value it started with (greater than or equal to 3), `xx` is an empty list, `j` is `n`, `sa` is an empty list, `nx` is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
        nx += xx[i][j - 1]
    elif i in sb[:n // 4 - 1] or j in sb[:n // 4 - 1]:
        nx += 'S'
    else:
        nx += 'F'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `nx` is a string, `j` is equal to `n`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3. If the element at index `j-1` in the list `xx[i]` is not `'?'`, then `nx` is the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`. If the element at index `j-1` in the list `xx[i]` is `'?'`, then `nx` is `'F'`. Additionally, if either `i` is in the range `sb[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in the range `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` is a string with the last character 'S' added.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `nx` is a string, `j` is `n + 1`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3. If either `i` is in the range `sb[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in the range `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` ends with 'S'. Otherwise, if the element at index `j-1` in the list `xx[i]` is not `'?'`, then `nx` is the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` followed by 'F'. If the element at index `j-1` in the list `xx[i]` is `'?'`, then `nx` is `'F'` followed by 'F'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `nx` is a string, `j` is `n + 2`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 3. If the character at position `j - 1` in `xx[i]` is not '?', then `nx` is the original string of `nx` with the last character of `xx[i][n]` appended to it. Otherwise, `nx` is either 'S' concatenated with the original string of `nx`, or "nFx".




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
