Output State: **`xx` is a 2D list, `i` is the same as before, `j` is `j + 1`, `nx` is the string 'S' added to `nx', `nx` is now a string that was previously a string plus 'S'.**

This means that the 2D list `xx`, the variable `i`, and the variable `j` remain unchanged. The variable `nx` has had the string 'S' appended to it.
