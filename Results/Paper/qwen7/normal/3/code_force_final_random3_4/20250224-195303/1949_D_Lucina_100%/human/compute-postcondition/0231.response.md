Output State: **`nx` is 'S', `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and the character at position `j - 1` in `xx[i]` is `'?'`, and neither `i` nor `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sa`**.

Explanation: The code `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. Since `nx` was initially an empty string, after executing this line, `nx` becomes 'S'. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
