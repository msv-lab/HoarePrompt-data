Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, the current value of `xx` is such that the element at index `[i][j - 1]` is not equal to '?', `nx` is the sum of its previous value and the element at index `[i][j - 1]` of `xx`.**

Explanation: The code updates the variable `nx` by adding the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to its current value. The precondition that `xx` has an element at index `[i][j - 1]` which is not equal to '?' remains unchanged. The value of `n` being at least 1 also remains unchanged.
