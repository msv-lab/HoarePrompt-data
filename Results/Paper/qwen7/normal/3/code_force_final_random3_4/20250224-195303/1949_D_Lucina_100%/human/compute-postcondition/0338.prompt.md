Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `nx` is an empty string, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `2 * n + 1`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 3.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
        nx += xx[i][j - 1]
    elif i in sb[:n // 4 - 1] or j in sb[:n // 4 - 1]:
        nx += 'S'
    else:
        nx += 'F'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `xx` is a 2D list, `i` and `j` are indices within `xx`, `nx` is updated based on the following conditions: if the value at `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is incremented by the value at `xx[i][j - 1]`. If the value at `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', then `nx` is set to 'S' if either `i` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`; otherwise, `nx` is set to 'F'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `xx` is a 2D list, `i` is the same as before, `j` is `j + 1`, `nx` is a string that is either concatenated with the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` if it is not '?', or appended with 'S' or 'F' based on whether `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sb`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `xx` is a 2D list, `i` is the same as before, `j` is `j + 1`, and `nx` is a string that is either concatenated with the value of `xx[i][j-1]` if it is not '?', or appended with 'S' or 'F' based on whether `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sb`. If `xx[i][j-1]` is not '?', `nx` remains unchanged from the concatenation. If `xx[i][j-1]` is '?', `nx` is initially appended with 'S' or 'F' based on whether `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sb`. After executing the if-else block, if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sb`, `nx` is further appended with 'S'. Otherwise, `nx` is appended with 'F'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
