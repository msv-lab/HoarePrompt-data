Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `x[0]` is 'F', `a[i]` is increased by 1.**

The code `a[i] += 1` increments the value of `a[i]` by 1. However, the initial state does not provide a specific value for `a` or `i`, so we only know that `a[i]` has been incremented. The other variables `j`, `n`, and `x[0]` remain unchanged according to the initial state.
