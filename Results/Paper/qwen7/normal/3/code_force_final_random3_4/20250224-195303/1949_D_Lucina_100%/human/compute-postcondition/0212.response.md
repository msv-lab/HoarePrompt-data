Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop variable in this case is `j`.

2. **Understand the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop starts with `j = 1` and increments `j` by 1 in each iteration.
   - The loop will continue as long as `j` is within the range `[1, n+1)`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `nx` is a string.
   - Either `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', in which case `nx` is the original string plus the character `xx[i][j - 1]`.
   - Or `i` is in the first quarter of `sa` (excluding the last element) or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa` (excluding the last element), in which case `nx` is 'F' followed by the original string value of `nx`.
   - If neither condition is met, `nx` is 'S' followed by the original string value of `nx`.
   - `n` must be at least 1.
   - `j` is `j + 1` at the end of the previous iteration.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, `j` will be `j + 1` in the next iteration.
   - `n` remains the same as it does not change within the loop.
   - `nx` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `nx` remains the same.
- `j` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `n` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`nx` is a string, and either the character `xx[i][j]` is not '?', in which case `nx` is the original string plus the character `xx[i][j]`, or `i` is in the first quarter of `sa` (excluding the last element) or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa` (excluding the last element). If neither condition is met, `nx` is 'S' followed by the original string value of `nx`, and `n` must be at least 1, and `j` is `j + 1`**.
