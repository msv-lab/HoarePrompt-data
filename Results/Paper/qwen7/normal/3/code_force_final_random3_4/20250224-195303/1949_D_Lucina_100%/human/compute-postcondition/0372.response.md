Based on the initial state provided:

- `nx` is a string composed of 'S' and 'F' based on certain conditions.
- `i` is incremented to `i + 3`.
- `n` is greater than or equal to 3.
- `j` is 3 after the last iteration.

The print statement is `print(nx)`. Since the value of `nx` is not explicitly defined in the initial state and no conditions or formulas are provided to determine its content, we can only state that `nx` is a string composed of 'S' and 'F'.

Output: **nx (where nx is a string composed of 'S' and 'F')**
