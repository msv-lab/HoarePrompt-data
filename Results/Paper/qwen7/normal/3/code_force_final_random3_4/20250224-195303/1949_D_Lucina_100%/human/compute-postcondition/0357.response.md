Output State: **`nx` is either 'SS' or 'FS', `i` is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2**

Explanation: The value of `nx` is concatenated with 'S'. Since `nx` was either 'S' or 'F', after concatenation, `nx` becomes either 'SS' (if `nx` was 'S') or 'FS' (if `nx` was 'F'). The increment operation on `i` and the conditions for `n` and `j` remain unchanged.
