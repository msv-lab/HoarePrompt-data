Output State: **`b[i]` is increased by 1; the element at index `j-1` of the array `x` is 'S'; `n` must be within the range 2 to 24**.

Explanation: The code `b[i] += 1` increments the value of `b[i]` by 1. The other conditions and the value of `x[j-1]` remain unchanged. The range of `n` also remains unaffected.
