Reasoning:

1. **Initial Conditions and Loop Structure**: The code correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case, processing the input and determining the outcome based on the given rules.

2. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - If `clues[2] > clues[4]` or `clues[0] == 1`, the game immediately ends in a draw. This condition is handled correctly.
   - The code checks the parity of `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` and the relative positions of `clues[3]` and `clues[5]`. Based on these conditions, it determines whether Alice, Bob, or the game ends in a draw.

3. **Detailed Logic Analysis**:
   - The logic for handling the draw when `clues[2] > clues[4]` or `clues[0] == 1` is correct.
   - The logic for checking the parity and relative positions of the coordinates is also correct. It correctly handles the different scenarios where Alice or Bob can win or the game ends in a draw.
   - The code correctly appends the result ('Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw') to the `answers` list for each test case.

4. **Output**: After processing all test cases, the code prints the results in the required format.

Given the detailed analysis, the code appears to handle all the conditions and logic correctly as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
