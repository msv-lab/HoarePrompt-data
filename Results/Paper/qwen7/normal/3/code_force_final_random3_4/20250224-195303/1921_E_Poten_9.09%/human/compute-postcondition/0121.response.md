Postcondition: **`test_cases` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ test_cases ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list, and `i` is 0. Depending on the conditions, `answers` will contain either 'Alice' or 'Draw'. Specifically, if `clues[3]` equals `clues[5]`, `answers` will be 'Alice'. If `clues[3]` does not equal `clues[5]`, and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, and certain additional conditions involving `clues[1]`, `clues[2]`, `clues[3]`, `clues[4]`, and `clues[5]` are met, `answers` will contain 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` will contain 'Alice'. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is not greater than 1, and either `clues[5] - 1 - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[3] - clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` is true, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Alice'.**
