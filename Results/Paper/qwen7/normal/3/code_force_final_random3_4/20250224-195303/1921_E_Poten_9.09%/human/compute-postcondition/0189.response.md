Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{test_cases} \leq 10^4\), `i` is 3, `answers` is a list with 'Bob' appended to it, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

In this state, the `answers` list now contains the string `'Bob'` in addition to any previous elements it may have had. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
