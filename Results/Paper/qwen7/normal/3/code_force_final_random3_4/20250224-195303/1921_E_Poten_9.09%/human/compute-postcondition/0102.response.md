Postcondition: `test_cases` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ test_cases ≤ 10^4, `answers` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, the current value of `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]`, and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, and `(clues[5] - 1 ≤ abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2) and clues[3] - clues[5] ≤ abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2))`.
