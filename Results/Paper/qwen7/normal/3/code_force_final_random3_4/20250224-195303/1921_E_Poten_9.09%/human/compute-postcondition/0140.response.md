Postcondition: `test_cases` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ test_cases ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `answers` is a list. If `clues[1] - clues[3]` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2] - clues[4]`, or `clues[3] - clues[5]` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of half the difference between `clues[2] - clues[4]`, then `answers` is a list with one element 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob'.
