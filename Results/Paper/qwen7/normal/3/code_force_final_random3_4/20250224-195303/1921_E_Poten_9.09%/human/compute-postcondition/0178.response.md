Postcondition: `test_cases` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ test_cases ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `answers` is a list. Based on the conditions of `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` being both even or both odd, `answers` will be updated as follows:
- If `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are both even or both odd, and `clues[3] == clues[5]`, then `answers` contains 'Alice'.
- If `clues[3] == clues[5]`, then `answers` contains 'Alice'.
- If `clues[3] < clues[5]` and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, then `answers` contains 'Draw'.
- If `clues[3] < clues[5]` and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is less than or equal to 1, then `answers` contains 'Bob'.
- If `clues[3] > clues[5]` and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, then `answers` contains 'Draw'.
- If `clues[3] > clues[5]` and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is less than or equal to 1, then `answers` contains 'Bob'.
- If `clues[3] == clues[5]` and `clues[1] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[5] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` is true, then `answers` contains 'Draw'.
- If `abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) <= 1` and `clues[1] - clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[5] - clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` is true, then `answers` contains 'Draw'.
- If `clues[3] > clues[5]` and `abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) > 1`, then `answers` contains 'Draw'.
