Postcondition: **`test_cases` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{test_cases} \leq 10^4\), `i` is 3, `answers` is a list. Based on the conditions involving `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`:
- If both `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are even, or both are odd, and `clues[3]` equals `clues[5]`, then 'Bob' is appended to `answers`.
- If both `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are even, or both are odd, and `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]`, then either 'Draw' or 'Bob' is appended to `answers`.
- If both `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are even, or both are odd, and `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]` with the absolute difference greater than 1, then 'Draw' is appended to `answers`.
- If both `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are even, or both are odd, and `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]` but the absolute difference is less than or equal to 1, then 'Bob' is appended to `answers`.
- If neither of the above conditions involving `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are met, and `clues[3]` equals `clues[5]`, then 'Alice' is appended to `answers`.
- If neither of the above conditions involving `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are met, and `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]`, then no additional elements are appended to `answers`.
- If neither of the above conditions involving `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are met, and `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]`, then either 'Draw' or 'Alice' is appended to `answers` based on the specified condition.**
