Postcondition: `test_cases` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ test_cases ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `answers` is a list. If `clues[3]` equals `clues[5]`, `answers` is a list containing 'Draw'. Otherwise, based on the comparison of `clues[3]` and `clues[5]`, `answers` will contain either 'Draw' or 'Bob' as follows:
- If `clues[3] < clues[5]` and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, then `answers` contains 'Draw'.
- If `clues[3] < clues[5]` and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is less than or equal to 1, then `answers` contains 'Bob'.
- If `clues[3] > clues[5]` and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, then `answers` contains 'Draw'.
- If `clues[3] > clues[5]` and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is less than or equal to 1, then `answers` contains 'Bob'.
