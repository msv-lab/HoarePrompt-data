Postcondition: `test_cases` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ test_cases ≤ 10^4, `answers` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces. Clues[2] is less than or equal to clues[4], clues[0] is not equal to 1, and either both clues[2] and clues[4] are even or both are odd. Additionally, `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, and `clues[3]` is greater than or equal to `clues[5]`. The current value of `clues[3]` is less than or equal to the current value of `clues[5]`, and `(clues[1] - clues[3] ≤ abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2) and clues[3] - clues[5] ≤ abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2))`.
