Postcondition: `test_cases` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{test_cases} \leq 10^4\), `i` is 3, and `answers` is a list. Depending on the values of `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`:
- If both `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are even, or both are odd, and if `clues[3]` equals `clues[5]`, then `answers` contains 'Bob'.
- If both `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are even, or both are odd, and if `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]`, then `answers` contains either 'Draw' or 'Bob'.
- If both `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are even, or both are odd, and if `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]` and the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, then `answers` contains 'Draw'.
- If both `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are even, or both are odd, and if none of the above conditions are met, then `answers` contains 'Bob'.
- If the condition specified in the else part is met, and `clues[3] == clues[5]`, then `answers` contains 'Alice'.
- If the condition specified in the else part is met, and `clues[3] < clues[5]`, no additional elements are appended to `answers`.
- If the condition specified in the else part is met, and `clues[3] > clues[5]`, then `answers` contains either 'Draw' or 'Alice' based on the condition `clues[5] - 1 - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2) or clues[3] - clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`. If the condition is not met, 'Draw' is appended to `answers`.
