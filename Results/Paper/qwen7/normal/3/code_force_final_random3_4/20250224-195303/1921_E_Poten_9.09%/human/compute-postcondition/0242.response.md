Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is set to `test_cases - 1`
- `answers` is a list containing the results for each test case and must have at least two elements remaining

The `print(j)` statement is given, but there is no definition or initialization for the variable `j` in the provided code snippet or initial state. Since `j` is not defined, it would result in a NameError if this code were to run. However, following the instructions to determine what will be printed based on the given information, we can only describe what we know about the variables involved.

Given the lack of information about `j`, we cannot determine its value. Therefore, the correct response adheres to the format:

Output: **NameError: name 'j' is not defined**
