Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variables `i` and `test_cases`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i < test_cases`.

3. **Current States at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `test_cases` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{test\_cases} \leq 10^4\).
   - `i` is currently 2.
   - `answers` is a list (its state is not relevant for adjusting the loop head variables).

4. **Determine the Next State for the Loop to Execute Again**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 from its current value.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 3.
   - The condition for the loop to continue (`i < test_cases`) must still hold true.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - `test_cases` remains unchanged and must still be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to continue.

Given these steps, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `test_cases`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`test_cases` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{test\_cases} \leq 10^4\), `i` is 3, `answers` is a list**.
