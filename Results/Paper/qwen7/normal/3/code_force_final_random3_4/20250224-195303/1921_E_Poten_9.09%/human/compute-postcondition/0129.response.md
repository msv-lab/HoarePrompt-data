Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ test_cases ≤ 10^4, `i` is 2, `answers` is a list containing 'Draw', `clues` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The line `answers.append('Draw')` adds the string `'Draw'` to the list `answers`. Initially, `i` is set to 1. After executing the line of code, `i` is incremented to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
