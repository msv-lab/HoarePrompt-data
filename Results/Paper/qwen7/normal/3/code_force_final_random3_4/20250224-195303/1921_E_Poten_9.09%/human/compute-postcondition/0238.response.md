Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is set to `test_cases - 1`
- `answers` is a list containing the results for each test case according to the rules defined in the loop.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
print(j)
```

To determine what will be printed, we need to consider the context of `j`. Since `j` is not defined in the provided initial state, it's important to note that the value of `j` is not explicitly given. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `j` from the provided information.

Given this, the most precise description we can provide is that `j` is a variable whose value is determined by some previous part of the code that is not shown here.

Output: **j**
