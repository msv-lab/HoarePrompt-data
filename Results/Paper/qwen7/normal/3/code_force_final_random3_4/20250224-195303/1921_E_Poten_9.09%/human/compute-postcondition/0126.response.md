Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ test_cases ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `answers` is a list, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `clues = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each element to an integer before storing them in the list `clues`. The initial values of `test_cases` and `i` remain unchanged, and `answers` remains a list but no specific values are assigned to it since no elements are added to it in this code snippet.
