Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The `test_cases` variable remains as an integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{test_cases} \leq 10^4\). The `i` variable is now equal to `test_cases - 1` since the loop has completed all its iterations. The `answers` list contains the results of applying the given logic to each set of input clues for all `test_cases`.

In more detail, for each of the `test_cases` provided:
- If `clues[2]` is greater than `clues[4]` or `clues[0]` is 1, 'Draw' is appended to `answers`.
- Otherwise, based on the parity (even or odd) of `clues[2]` and `clues[4]`, and the comparison between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]`, 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw' is appended to `answers`.

The final state of `answers` is a list containing the outcomes for each of the `test_cases` according to the rules defined in the loop.
Code of the loop:
for j in answers:
    print(j)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `test_cases - 1`, `answers` is a list containing the results for each test case according to the rules defined in the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `test_cases - 1`, `answers` is a list containing the results for each test case and must have at least one element remaining

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `test_cases - 1`, `answers` is a list containing the results for each test case and must have at least two elements remaining




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
