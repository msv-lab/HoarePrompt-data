Output State: **`test_cases` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ test_cases ≤ 10^4, `answers` is a list containing 'Draw', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `clues[3]` is greater than or equal to `clues[5]`, and either `clues[5] - 1 - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` or `clues[3] - clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` is true.**

Explanation: The code appends the string 'Draw' to the list `answers`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition involving `clues` remains valid as no changes were made to the `clues` list or its elements.
