Postcondition: `test_cases` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{test\_cases} \leq 10^4\), `i` is 3, `answers` is a list. If the condition `clues[5] - 1 - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2) or clues[3] - clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` is true, `answers` will have 'Draw' appended to it. Otherwise, `answers` will have 'Alice' appended to it. `clues` remains a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer.
