Postcondition: `test_cases` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{test_cases} \leq 10^4\), `i` is 3, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw' or 'Alice'. `clues` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is greater than 1, `answers` is updated to include 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` is updated to include 'Alice'.
