Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is set to `test_cases - 1`
- `answers` is a list containing the results for each test case and must have at least one element remaining

The variable `j` is not mentioned in the initial state, and there is no assignment or initialization for `j` in the given code snippet. Therefore, `j` is not defined, and attempting to print it would result in a NameError.

Given this, the code snippet provided would raise an error because `j` is undefined.

Output: **NameError: name 'j' is not defined**
