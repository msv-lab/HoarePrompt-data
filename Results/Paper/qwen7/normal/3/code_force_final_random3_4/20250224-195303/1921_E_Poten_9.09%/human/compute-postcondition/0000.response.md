Output State: **`test_cases` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `test_cases`. This integer represents the number of test cases. Since the initial state specifies that `t` (which is equivalent to `test_cases` in this context) is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, the same condition applies to `test_cases`. All other variables (`h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`) remain in their initial state as they are not affected by this line of code.
