Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq \text{test_cases} \leq 10^4\), `i` is 3, `answers` is a list containing 'Alice', `clues` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code snippet appends the string `'Alice'` to the list `answers`. Initially, `answers` is an empty list. After executing `answers.append('Alice')`, `answers` contains the single element `'Alice'`. The values of `test_cases`, `i`, and `clues` remain unchanged.
