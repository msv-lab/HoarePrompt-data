Output State: **`mini` is equal to the last element in `arr`, `i` is either 4 or 5 depending on the value of `res`, `maxi` is 0, `res` is an input from the user, and `arr` now contains the elements [last element of `arr`, 3, `i`]**.

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` to the list `arr`. The value of `i` is either 4 or 5 depending on the value of `res`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `arr` now contains the elements as specified, and the rest of the variables retain their initial conditions.
