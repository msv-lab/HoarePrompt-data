Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `i`. The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mini` is equal to the last element in `arr`.
   - `i` is equal to `n-1`.
   - `maxi` is `n-1`.
   - `res` is an input string from the user, and it equals '<'.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is within the range of 1 to `n-1`. Since `i` starts at `n-1` and the loop runs until `i` is less than `n`, the loop will execute once for `i = n-1`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - After the first iteration where `i` is `n-1`, `i` will be decremented by 1 (since the loop runs in the range from 1 to `n-1`).
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `n-2`.

5. **Maintain other states**: The other states (`mini`, `maxi`, and `res`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, which is not mentioned here.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`mini` is equal to the last element in `arr`, `i` is equal to `n-2`, `maxi` is `n-1`, and `res` is an input string from the user, and it equals '<'**.
