Based on the initial state provided:

- `total` is explicitly stated to be 10.
- `i` is less than `n`, but the exact value of `i` is not specified.
- `arr` is a list containing only one element, which is 0.
- `maxi` is explicitly stated to be 3.
- `res` is an input string, but its value is not relevant to the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
```

Here's the breakdown:
- `'?'` is a literal string.
- `maxi` is 3.
- `arr[0]` is 0.
- `maxi` is again 3.
- `i` is less than `n`, but since `i` is not further defined or constrained beyond this, we keep it as "less than `n`".

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'? 3 0 3 less than n'**
