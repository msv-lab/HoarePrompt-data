Output: **! n mini (where n is the length of the array arr and mini is the smallest element in the array arr)**

Explanation:
- `mini` is the smallest element in the array `arr`. Since `arr` contains all integers from 0 to `n-1`, the smallest element is 0.
- `maxi` is `n-1`, where `n` is the length of the array `arr`.
- `i` is `n`, but this value is not used in the print statement.
- `res` is either '<' or '=', but it does not affect the print statement.

Therefore, the print statement will output `! n mini`, where `n` is the length of the array `arr` and `mini` is the smallest element in the array `arr`, which is 0.
