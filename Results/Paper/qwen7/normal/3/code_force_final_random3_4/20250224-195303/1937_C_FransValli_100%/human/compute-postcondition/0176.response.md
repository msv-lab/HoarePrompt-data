Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is greater than 2
   - If `res` equals '<', then `maxi` is 2; otherwise, there is no change to the variables.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 3.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 3 (since `i` is now 3).

5. **Consider the postcondition involving `res` and `maxi`**:
   - The value of `maxi` is only updated if `res` equals '<'. Since this condition does not affect the loop continuation directly, it remains unchanged for the purpose of determining the loop state.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3**
