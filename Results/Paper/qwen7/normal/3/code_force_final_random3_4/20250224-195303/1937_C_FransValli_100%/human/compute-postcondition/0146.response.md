Based on the initial state provided:

- `arr` must have at least 3 elements.
- The third element of `arr` is `item`.
- `res` is an input string.
- If `res` is '>', then `mini` is set to `item`.

Given this, let's break down the `print` statement:

```python
print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
```

1. The string `'?'` will be printed first.
2. Since `mini` is set to `item` only if `res` is '>', we need to consider the value of `item`. However, the value of `item` itself is not explicitly given; it is just stated that it is the third element of `arr`.
3. The value of `item` will be printed twice.
4. The value of `item` will be printed twice again.

Therefore, the output will depend on the value of `item`, but the structure will be consistent with the provided information.

Output: **'? [mini] [mini] [item] [item]** (where `[mini]` is the value of `item` if `res` is '>', and `[item]` is the third element of `arr`)
