Output State: **i is n, maxi is n-1, n is greater than n-1, res is an input string which is either '<' or '=', arr contains all integers from 0 to n-1.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, `maxi` will be `n-1`, `n` will still be greater than `n-1`, `res` will be either the string '<' or '=', and `arr` will contain all integers from 0 to `n-1`. The exact content of `arr` depends on the responses given during each iteration of the loop (either appending `i` or not).
