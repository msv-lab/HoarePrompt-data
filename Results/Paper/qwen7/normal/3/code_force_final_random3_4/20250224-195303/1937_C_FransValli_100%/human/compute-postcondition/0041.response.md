Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is less than `n`, `arr` is a list containing `i + 1` and `i`, `maxi` is 3, `res` is an input string which is either equal to '<' or '=' and `res` is an input from the user.**

Explanation: The code `arr.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `arr`. Since `arr` initially contains either `0` and `i + 1` or just `i + 1`, after appending `i`, `arr` will contain `i + 1` and `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
