Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is within the range specified by `range(1, n)`. This means `i` should be less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `mini` is equal to the last element in `arr`.
   - `i` is equal to `n-2`.
   - `maxi` is `i`.
   - `res` is the new input string from the user, currently set to '<'.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is currently `n-2`, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `n-1`.
   - The condition `i < n` must still hold true, so `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Update the states**:
   - `i` changes from `n-2` to `n-1`.
   - `mini` remains unchanged.
   - `maxi` remains unchanged.
   - `res` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`mini` is equal to the last element in `arr`, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `maxi` is `n-2`, and `res` is the new input string from the user, where the current value of `res` is '<'.**
