Output State: **After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be less than `n`, `arr` will be a list containing either `[i]` or `[i + 1, i]` depending on the user inputs, `maxi` will still be 3, and `res` will be an input string from the user.**

In more detail, after the loop completes all its iterations:
- The variable `i` will be less than `n`.
- The list `arr` will contain either the last value of `i` (if `res` was '<' for all iterations), or a list containing two consecutive values of `i` (if `res` was '=' for at least one iteration).
- The variable `maxi` remains unchanged at 3.
- The variable `res` will hold the last user input received during the loop's execution.
