Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: We know that the loop runs for a number of iterations equal to the integer input provided by the user. However, since we don't know the exact number of iterations, we need to consider the general case where the loop runs for some number of times.

2. **Loop Head Variables**: The only variables mentioned in the loop head are the loop counter `_` and the input value, which is used to determine the number of iterations. Since the loop counter `_` is not used inside the loop, it doesn't affect the state outside the loop. The key variables that can change inside the loop are `arr`, `mini`, and `maxi`.

3. **State Adjustments**:
   - `arr`: The array `arr` must have at least `len(arr)` elements after each iteration, meaning it grows by one element per iteration.
   - `mini`: This variable holds the minimum value found in the array after comparing each element with the current `mini` and updating it when necessary.
   - `maxi`: This variable remains 0 throughout the loop and does not change.

4. **Incrementing the Loop Counter**: Since the loop runs for an integer input provided by the user, the loop counter `_` will increment by 1 with each iteration. However, this does not affect the state of the variables outside the loop.

Given these points, let's adjust the state for the next iteration of the loop:

- `arr` will have one more element added to it.
- `mini` will hold the minimum value found in the array after comparing each element with the current `mini`.
- `maxi` will remain 0.
- `i` will remain unchanged as it was initialized to `n` and is not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes.

**State:**
- `arr` must have at least `len(arr) + 1` elements.
- `mini` will hold the minimum value found in the array after comparing each element with the current `mini`.
- `maxi` remains 0.
- `i` remains unchanged.

So, the final state is:
State: **`arr` must have at least `len(arr) + 1` elements, `mini` will hold the minimum value found in the array, `maxi` remains 0, `i` remains unchanged**.
