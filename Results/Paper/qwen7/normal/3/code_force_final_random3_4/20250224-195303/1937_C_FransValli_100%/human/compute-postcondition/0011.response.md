Based on the initial state provided:

- `maxi` is explicitly given as 1.
- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `res` is an input string with the current value of `<`.
- `n` must be greater than 2 but its exact value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
```

This will print the string `?` followed by the values of `maxi` (which is 1), `maxi` again (which is 1), `i` (which is 2), and `i` again (which is 2). The `flush=True` parameter ensures that the output is immediately flushed to the console, but it does not affect the content being printed.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **'? 1 1 2 2'**
