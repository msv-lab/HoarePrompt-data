Based on the initial state provided:

- `total` is explicitly given as 10.
- `i` is less than `n`, but the exact value of `i` is not specified.
- `arr` is a list containing either `[i + 1]` or `[i + 2]` depending on the value of `i`.
- `maxi` is explicitly given as 3.
- `res` is an input string which is either equal to '<' or '=', but it does not affect the print statement.

Given these details, the print statement will output:

- `'?'` as the first part of the string.
- `maxi` which is 3.
- `arr[0]`, which will be either `i + 1` or `i + 2` depending on the value of `i`.
- `maxi` again, which is 3.
- `i`, which is less than `n`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **'? 3 [i+1 or i+2] 3 [i] where i < n'**
