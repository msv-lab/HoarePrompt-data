Output State: **`mini` is equal to the last element in `arr`, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `maxi` is `n-1`, and `res` is an input string from the user.**

Explanation: The line `maxi = i` updates the variable `maxi` to be equal to the current value of `i`, which is `n-1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
