Output State: **`total` is 10; `i` is less than `n`; `arr` is a list containing 0 and `i`; `maxi` is 3; `res` is an input string and is equal to '='**.

Explanation: The code `arr.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `arr`. Since `arr` initially contains only the value 0, after appending `i`, `arr` will contain 0 and `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
