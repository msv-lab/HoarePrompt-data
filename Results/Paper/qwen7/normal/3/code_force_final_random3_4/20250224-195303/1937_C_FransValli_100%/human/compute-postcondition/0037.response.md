Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `total` is 10
   - `i` is less than `n`
   - `arr` is a list containing either 0 and `i` or just `i`
   - `maxi` is 3
   - `res` is an input string which is either equal to '<' or '='

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` is less than `n`, the loop will execute again if `i` is incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will be incremented from its current value to `i + 1`.
   - The condition `i < n` must still hold true for the next iteration.

5. **Update the State**:
   - `total` remains unchanged at 10.
   - `i` is incremented by 1, so if `i` was previously less than `n`, it will now be `i + 1`.
   - `arr`, `maxi`, and `res` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Given these points, the updated state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`total` is 10, `i` is less than `n`, `arr` is a list containing either 0 and `i + 1` or just `i + 1`, `maxi` is 3, and `res` is an input string which is either equal to '<' or '='**
