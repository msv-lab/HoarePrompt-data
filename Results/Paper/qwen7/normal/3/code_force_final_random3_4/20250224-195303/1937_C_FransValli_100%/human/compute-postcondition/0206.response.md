Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `n-1`, inclusive. This means the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is either `3` or `2`.
   - `maxi` is `n-1`.
   - `n` is greater than `n-1` (which is always true since `n` is an integer).
   - `res` is an input string.
   - `arr` is either `[1, 3]` or `[2]`.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - If `i` is `2`, then `i + 1` will be `3`, and the loop will continue if `3 < n`.
   - If `i` is `3`, then `i + 1` will be `4`, and the loop will continue if `4 < n`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts from `1` and increments by `1` each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, if `i` was `2`, it will become `3`.
   - If `i` was `3`, it will become `4`.

6. **Maintain other states**:
   - `maxi` remains `n-1` because it does not change within the loop.
   - `n` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
   - `res` remains an input string because it is not modified within the loop.
   - `arr` remains either `[1, 3]` or `[2]` because it is not modified within the loop.

Given this analysis, the updated state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 3, `maxi` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than `n-1`, `res` is an input string, `arr` is either `[1, 3]` or `[2]`**.
