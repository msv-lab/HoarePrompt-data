Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is less than `n`, `arr` is a list containing `i`, `maxi` is 3, `res` is an input string, and the current value of `res` is '<'**.

Explanation: The code `arr = [i]` creates a new list containing the value of `i`. Since `i` is less than `n`, the condition `i < n` remains true. The other variables (`total`, `maxi`, `res`) remain unchanged. The value of `arr` is updated to be a list containing `i`.
