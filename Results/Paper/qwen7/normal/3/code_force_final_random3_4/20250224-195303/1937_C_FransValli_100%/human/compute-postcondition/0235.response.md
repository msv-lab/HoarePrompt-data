Output State: `mini` is the smallest element in `arr`, `i` is `n`, `maxi` is `n-1`, `res` is an input string which is either '<' or '=', `arr` contains all integers from 0 to `n-1`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `mini` will be set to the smallest element in the array `arr`. This is because the loop continuously updates `mini` to be the current `item` if the user inputs '>' in response to the comparison, effectively finding the minimum value in the array. The values of `i`, `maxi`, `res`, and `arr` remain unchanged as per the given conditions.
