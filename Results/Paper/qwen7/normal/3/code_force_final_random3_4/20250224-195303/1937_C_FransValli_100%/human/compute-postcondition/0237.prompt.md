Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: None of the input variables are explicitly defined in the provided function signature. However, based on the problem description, the interaction involves querying indices and comparing bitwise OR results to deduce the maximum XOR pair. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1, and the interaction rules are specified for querying and answering.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    maxi = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '<':
            maxi = i
    arr = [0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '<':
            arr = [i]
        elif res == '=':
            arr.append(i)
    mini = arr[0]
    for item in arr[1:]:
        print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '>':
            mini = item
    print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `mini` is equal to the last element in `arr`, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `arr` has at least two elements, `maxi` is still 3, and `res` is the input string from the user.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `arr` must have at least `len(arr)` elements, with each element of `arr` being checked exactly once starting from the second element. The variable `mini` will hold the minimum value among all elements of `arr` that was updated whenever `res` was '>' during the loop iterations. The variable `i` remains unchanged as it was initialized to `n` (which is not further modified within the loop) and `maxi` remains 0 throughout the loop.

In simpler terms, `mini` will be the smallest value found in the array `arr` after comparing each element with the current `mini` and updating it when necessary based on user input. The other variables (`i` and `maxi`) will retain their initial values.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `mini` is the smallest element in `arr`, `i` is `n`, `maxi` is `n-1`, `res` is an input string which is either '<' or '=', `arr` contains all integers from 0 to `n-1`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `mini` will be set to the smallest element in the array `arr`. This is because the loop continuously updates `mini` to be the current `item` if the user inputs '>' in response to the comparison, effectively finding the minimum value in the array. The values of `i`, `maxi`, `res`, and `arr` remain unchanged as per the given conditions.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
