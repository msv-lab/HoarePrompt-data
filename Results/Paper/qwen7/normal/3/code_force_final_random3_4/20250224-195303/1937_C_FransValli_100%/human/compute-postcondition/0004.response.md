Based on the initial state provided:

- `maxi` is explicitly given as 0.
- `i` is explicitly given as 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1, but this value is not needed to determine the output of the print statement.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
```

Breaking down the print statement:
- `'?'` is a string literal.
- `maxi` is 0.
- The second occurrence of `maxi` is also 0.
- `i` is 1.
- The second occurrence of `i` is also 1.

Therefore, the print statement will output the string `'?'` followed by the values of `maxi` and `i` as specified.

Output: **'? 0 0 1 1'**
