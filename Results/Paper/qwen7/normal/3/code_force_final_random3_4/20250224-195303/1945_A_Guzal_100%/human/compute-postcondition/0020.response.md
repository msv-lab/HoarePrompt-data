Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split, `k` is 0.**

Explanation: The code sets `k` to 0. Since `k` was previously determined based on certain conditions involving `a`, `b`, and `c`, setting `k` to 0 overrides any previous calculation. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code snippet.
