Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split.**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes three space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `a`, `b`, and `c`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `i` is still 0. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer within the specified range, `n` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0 is still valid.
