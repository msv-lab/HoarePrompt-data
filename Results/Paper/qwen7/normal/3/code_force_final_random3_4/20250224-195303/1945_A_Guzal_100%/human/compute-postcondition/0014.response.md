Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split, `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`, `b` is divisible by 3 or `b` is not divisible by 3 and `b % 3 + c` is greater than or equal to 3, and the current value of `(b + c) % 3` is not 0.
