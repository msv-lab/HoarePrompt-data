Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split, `k` is 0.**

The code initializes `k` to 0, which does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
