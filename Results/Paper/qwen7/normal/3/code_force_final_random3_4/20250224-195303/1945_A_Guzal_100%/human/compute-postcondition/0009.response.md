Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0, `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split, `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3`, `b` is divisible by 3 or `b` is not divisible by 3 and `b % 3 + c` is greater than or equal to 3.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is updated by adding `a + (b + c) // 3` to its current value. Since `k` was initially 0, the new value of `k` is simply `a + (b + c) // 3`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.
