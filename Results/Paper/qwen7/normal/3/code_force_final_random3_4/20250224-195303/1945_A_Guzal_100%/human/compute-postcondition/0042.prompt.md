You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three non-negative integers a, b, and c such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        k = 0
        
        if b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3:
            print(-1)
        else:
            k += a + (b + c) // 3
            if (b + c) % 3 != 0:
                k += 1
            print(k)
        
    #State: Output State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed, `i` will be equal to `n - 1` (since the loop increments `i` from 0 to `n-1`), and `k` will be the sum of `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1` for each iteration where `b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3` is false, otherwise it will be `a + (b + c) // 3`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, `k` accumulates the value of `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1` for each iteration unless the condition `b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3` is met, in which case `k` does not increment. The final value of `k` is the sum of these values over all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of test cases where each test case contains three integers: the number of introverts (a), the number of extroverts (b), and the number of universals (c). The function returns the result based on the given conditions for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
