Output State: **Postcondition: `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `i` is the largest integer such that \(i^2 \leq x\), `output1` is a list containing all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to \(\sqrt{x}\), and `output2` is a list containing the corresponding quotients of `x` divided by each divisor in `output1` in the same order.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `x` remains within the specified range. The variable `i` will be the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to `x`. The list `output1` will contain all integers from 1 up to the largest integer divisor of `x` that does not exceed \(\sqrt{x}\). The list `output2` will contain the corresponding quotients when `x` is divided by each divisor in `output1`.
