Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`. However, from the given postcondition, we know that `n` is derived from `x` and is set to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\).
   - `i` is 2.
   - `output1` is a list containing the value 1.
   - `output2` is either a list containing the value `int(x / i)` if `x` is divisible by `i`, or an empty list if `x` is not divisible by `i`.

3. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1, the next value of `i` would be 3.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 3.
   - `n` remains the same, which is `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
   - `output1` and `output2` remain unchanged unless `x` is divisible by `i = 3`.

Since the problem does not specify that `x` is divisible by `i = 3`, we assume `output2` remains unchanged as an empty list.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `i` is 3, `output1` is a list containing the value 1, and `output2` is an empty list.**
