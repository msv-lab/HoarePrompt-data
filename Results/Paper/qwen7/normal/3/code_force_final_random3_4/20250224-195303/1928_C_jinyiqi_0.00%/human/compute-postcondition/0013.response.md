Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `x`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\)
   - `i` is 3
   - `output1` is a list containing the value [3]
   - `output2` is a list containing the value [int(x / 3)] if `x` is divisible by 3. Otherwise, `output2` remains an empty list.

4. **Check the loop condition**:
   - The loop starts with `i = 3`.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3. For the loop to continue, `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` must be greater than 3.

5. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 4.
   - `x` remains unchanged.
   - `output1` and `output2` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the loop head variables.

6. **New state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` is now 4.
   - `x` remains the same.
   - `output1` remains [3].
   - `output2` remains [int(x / 3)] if `x` is divisible by 3, otherwise it remains an empty list.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\), `i` is 4, `output1` is a list containing the value [3], and `output2` is a list containing the value [int(x / 3)] if `x` is divisible by 3. Otherwise, `output2` remains an empty list.**
