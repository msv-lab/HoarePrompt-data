Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is explicitly set to 2.
   - `t` is a positive integer with \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). Its exact value is not specified, but it does not affect the output of the print statement.
   - `x` is an input integer. Its value is not specified, but it will be used to determine `y`.
   - `y` is defined as `x // 2`, which means `y` is the integer division of `x` by 2.

2. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement outputs the value of `y`.

Given the initial state, the only variable whose value is directly printed is `y`. Since `y` is defined as `x // 2`, the exact value of `y` depends on the value of `x`. However, without knowing the specific value of `x`, we can only describe `y` in terms of `x`.

Output: **x // 2 (where x is the input integer)**
