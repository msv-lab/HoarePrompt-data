Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the current state**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `i` is 0
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
   - `x` is an input integer
   - `y` is `x // 2`

3. **Determine the condition for the next iteration**: The loop will continue as long as `i < int(input())`. Since `i` starts at 0, the loop will execute once if `int(input())` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, so if the loop continues, `i` will become 1.
   - The value of `int(input())` remains the same for the next iteration because it is determined by user input, which is not modified within the loop.

5. **Update the state**: The state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is an input integer, `y` is `x // 2`**
