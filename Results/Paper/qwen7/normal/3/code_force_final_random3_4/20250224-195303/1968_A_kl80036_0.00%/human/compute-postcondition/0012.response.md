Output State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` will be equal to `t - 1`, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` will be the last input integer from the user for the current test case, and `y` is `x // 2`.

This means that the variable `i` will take on the value of `t - 1` because the loop runs from `0` to `t-1`. The variable `x` will be set to the last input integer provided by the user during the loop's final iteration. The variable `y` will be the result of dividing `x` by 2 using integer division.
