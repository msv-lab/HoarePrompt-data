Output State: **`i` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an input integer**.

The code `x = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `x`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0, and the condition for `t` (being a positive integer between 1 and 1000) is still valid.
