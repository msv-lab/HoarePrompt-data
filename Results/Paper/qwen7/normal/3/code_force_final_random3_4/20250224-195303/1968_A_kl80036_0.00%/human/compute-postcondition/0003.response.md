Given the initial state:
- `i` is 0
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000
- `x` is an input integer
- `y` is `x // 2`

We need to determine what will be printed when the statement `print(y)` is executed.

From the initial state, we know that `y` is defined as `x // 2`. This means `y` is the integer division of `x` by 2. Since `x` is an input integer, it could be any integer value, but `y` will always be the result of dividing `x` by 2 and rounding down to the nearest integer.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `y`, which is `x // 2`.

Output: **x // 2**
