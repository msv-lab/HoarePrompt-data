Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `x` is the new input integer from the user, `y` is `x // 2`.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `y` to be `x // 2`, where `x` is the new input integer from the user. The values of `i` and `t` remain unchanged.
