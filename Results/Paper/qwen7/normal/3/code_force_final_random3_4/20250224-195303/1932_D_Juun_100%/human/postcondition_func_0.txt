The function processes a set of card descriptions to determine the trump suit and form pairs of ranks and suits based on certain conditions. It updates the `trumps` list with ranks of cards that match the trump suit and the `answers` list with valid pairs of ranks and suits. If there are remaining ranks in the `trumps` list, it prints them in descending order. Finally, it prints all the valid pairs stored in the `answers` list. The function does not return any value.
