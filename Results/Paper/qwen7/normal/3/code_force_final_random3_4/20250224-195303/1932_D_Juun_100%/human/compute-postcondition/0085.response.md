Output State: **The `answers` list is empty.**

Explanation: Given that the loop continues to execute as long as `answers` is not empty, and it processes one element from the list per iteration, the list will eventually become empty after all possible iterations. Since the loop condition is `answers != []`, once the list is empty, the loop will terminate. Therefore, after all iterations, the `answers` list will be empty.
