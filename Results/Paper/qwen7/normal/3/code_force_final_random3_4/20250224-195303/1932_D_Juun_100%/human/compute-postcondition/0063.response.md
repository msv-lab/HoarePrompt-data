Output State: **`rank` remains unchanged, `suit` is the next key in the `suits` dictionary, `trumps` is a list with one element less than before, `answers` is a list with one additional element which is a string formatted as f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}'**.

This means that the `answers` list has been updated with a new string that includes the current `rank`, `suit`, the last element of `trumps` (which is popped from the list), and `trump`. All other variables remain in their previous states except for `trumps`, which now has one less element.
