Postcondition: **`rank` and `suit` are the rank and suit of the next card; `trumps` is either an empty list or a list containing the `rank` (possibly updated); `answers` is either an empty list or a list containing one element which is a string formed by joining the elements of a list obtained by sorting `[suits[suit], rank]` and then converting each element to a string and joining them with spaces (possibly updated); `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values where `suits[suit]` is either `None` or `rank`.**

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts, indicating that regardless of whether the condition `suit == trump` is true or false, the variables `rank`, `suit`, `trumps`, `answers`, and `suits` will be updated according to the specified rules.
