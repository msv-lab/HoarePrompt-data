Output State: **`rank` and `suit` are the rank and suit of the next card; `trumps` is a list containing the original `trumps` list plus the `rank`; `answers` is either an empty list or a list containing one element which is a string formed by joining the elements of a list obtained by sorting `[suits[suit], rank]` and then converting each element to a string and joining them with spaces (possibly updated); `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values where `suits[suit]` is either None or `rank` (possibly updated)**.

Explanation: The line `trumps.append(rank)` appends the value of `rank` to the list `trumps`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `trumps` now includes the original contents plus the new `rank`. The other variables (`rank`, `suit`, `answers`, and `suits`) retain their initial states but with the understanding that `suits[suit]` might now be updated to `rank` if it was `None` before.
