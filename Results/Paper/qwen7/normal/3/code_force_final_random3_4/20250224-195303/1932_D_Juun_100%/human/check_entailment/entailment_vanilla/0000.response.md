Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the rules of the card game described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of rounds `n`, the trump suit, and the list of 2n cards.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `func_1()` is called for each test case.
   - It initializes an empty list `trumps` to store the ranks of the trump cards.
   - It initializes an empty list `answers` to store the reconstructed rounds.
   - It initializes a dictionary `suits` to keep track of the highest non-trump card for each suit.

3. **Processing Cards:**
   - For each card in the input, it checks if the card is a trump card.
     - If it is a trump card, it adds the rank to the `trumps` list.
   - If the card is not a trump card, it checks if there is already a highest non-trump card for that suit:
     - If there is, it sorts the ranks and appends the move to `answers`.
     - If there isn't, it updates the highest non-trump card for that suit.

4. **Handling Remaining Non-Trump Cards:**
   - After processing all cards, it handles any remaining non-trump cards by checking if there are any trump cards left.
   - If there are, it pairs the highest non-trump card with the highest trump card.
   - If there are no trump cards left, it prints "IMPOSSIBLE" and returns.

5. **Reconstructing Trump Card Pairs:**
   - It sorts the remaining trump cards in descending order and pairs them with each other.

6. **Outputting Results:**
   - It prints the reconstructed moves from `answers`.
   - If there are any remaining trump cards, it prints their pairs.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Trump Card Handling:**
   - The program correctly identifies and pairs trump cards with non-trump cards according to the rules.
   - It ensures that trump cards can beat any non-trump card, regardless of rank.

2. **Non-Trump Card Handling:**
   - The program correctly pairs non-trump cards with the highest available non-trump card for each suit.
   - It ensures that if a non-trump card cannot be paired, the result is "IMPOSSIBLE".

3. **Remaining Trump Cards:**
   - The program correctly pairs the remaining trump cards with each other in descending order.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles cases where there are no trump cards left or no non-trump cards left appropriately.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic correctly follows the rules of the game and handles all edge cases as required.

**Correctness: True**
