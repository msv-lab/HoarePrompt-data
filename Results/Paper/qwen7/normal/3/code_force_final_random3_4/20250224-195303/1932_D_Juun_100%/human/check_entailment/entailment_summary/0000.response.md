Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it correctly identifies the trump suit and splits the input into individual cards.
3. It handles the logic for determining which card beats another based on the rules provided:
   - Cards of the same suit and higher rank beat lower rank cards of the same suit.
   - Trump cards can beat any non-trump card, regardless of rank.
4. The program attempts to pair the cards according to the rules and constructs the output accordingly.
5. The handling of remaining trump cards and non-trump cards is also correctly implemented.
6. The program checks for impossible scenarios and outputs "IMPOSSIBLE" when necessary.

Given the execution summary and the provided example, the program appears to handle all the specified cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
