Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is a string input by the user, `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is a list containing one element which is a string formed by joining the elements of a list obtained by sorting `[suits[suit], rank]` and then converting each element to a string and joining them with spaces, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values all to None, the current value of `suit` is not equal to the trump suit, and `suits[suit]` is now None.**

The code `suits[suit] = None` sets the value of `suits[suit]` to `None`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
