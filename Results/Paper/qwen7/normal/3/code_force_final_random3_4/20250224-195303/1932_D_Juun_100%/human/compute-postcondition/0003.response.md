Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is a string input by the user, `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `answers`. The values of `t`, `n`, and the trump suit remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions along with the new empty list `answers`.
