Based on the initial state provided:

- `answers` is a non-empty list.
- `answer` is the next element in the list `answers`.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(answer)
```

Since `answer` is explicitly stated to be the next element in the list `answers`, we can directly use this information to determine the output.

Output: **the next element in the list answers**
