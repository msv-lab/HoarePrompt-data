Output State: **`rank` and `suit` are the rank and suit of the next card; `trumps` is either an empty list or a list containing the `rank` (possibly updated); `answers` is either an empty list or a list containing one element which is a string formed by joining the elements of a list obtained by sorting `[suits[suit], rank]` and then converting each element to a string and joining them with spaces (possibly updated); `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values where `suits[suit]` is either `None` or `rank`. The values of `rank` and `suit` are updated to the rank and suit of the next card.**

Explanation: The code `rank, suit = card` unpacks the tuple `card` into the variables `rank` and `suit`. This means that the values of `rank` and `suit` are now set to the rank and suit of the next card. All other variables (`trumps`, `answers`, and `suits`) remain unchanged from their previous states.
