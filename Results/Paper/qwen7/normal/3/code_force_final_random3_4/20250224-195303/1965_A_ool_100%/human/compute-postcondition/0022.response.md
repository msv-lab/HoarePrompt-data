Output State: **`A` is False, `not_c` is False, `i` is `i + 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The `break` statement does not modify any variables but instead breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional block it is within. Since no loop or conditional block was specified in the code snippet, we assume it is breaking out of the most internal one. The values of `A`, `not_c`, and `i` remain unchanged.
