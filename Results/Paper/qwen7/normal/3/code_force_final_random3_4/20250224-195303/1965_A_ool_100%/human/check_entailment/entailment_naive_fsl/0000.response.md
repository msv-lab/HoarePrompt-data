Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the game logic. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not accurately determine the winner based on the game rules. The function checks if the smallest pile is not 1 and returns "Alice" immediately, which is not always correct. Additionally, the function's logic for determining the winner based on the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted unique pile sizes is flawed and does not account for the optimal strategy of the game.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

- Input:
```
1
4
1 2 2 3
```

- Expected Output:
```
Alice
```

- Actual Output:
```
Bob
```

In this case, the smallest pile is 1, and the unique sorted pile sizes are [1, 2, 3]. The function incorrectly returns "Bob" because it does not properly simulate the optimal moves according to the game rules. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
