Output State: **`A` is False; `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code `set_.sort()` sorts the list `set_` in ascending order. The initial state of `A` remains unchanged as it is set to `False`. The list `set_` is modified to be sorted, but its uniqueness is not guaranteed by the sort operation (since sorting does not preserve the uniqueness of elements). However, since the problem specifies that `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr`, we assume the sort operation does not affect the uniqueness property. Therefore, the output state reflects that `A` remains `False` and `set_` is now sorted.
