You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile, and the length of arr (n) satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. Each integer in the list satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func_1(arr):
    A = False
    set_ = list(set(arr))
    set_.sort()
    if (set_[0] != 1) :
        return 'Alice'
        #The program returns 'Alice'
    #State: `A` is False, `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order, and the first element of `set_` is 1
    not_c = True
    for i in range(1, len(set_)):
        if set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1:
            not_c = False
            break
        
        A = not A
        
    #State: Output State: `A` is False, `not_c` is False, `i` is equal to the length of `set_`.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, the value of `A` alternates starting from `False` (since it starts as `True` and changes each iteration). The variable `not_c` remains `False` because it is set to `False` when the condition `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1` is met, which causes the loop to break. Since the loop breaks as soon as the condition is met, `not_c` does not change back to `True`. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of `set_` because the loop increments `i` from 1 up to `len(set_) - 1`, and then the loop ends.
    if not_c :
        A = not A
    #State: `A` is False, `not_c` is False, `i` is equal to the length of `set_`.
    return 'Alice' if A else 'Bob'
    #The program returns 'Bob'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. The length of `arr` (denoted as `n`) satisfies the condition 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and each integer in the list satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. Based on the conditions given, the function returns either 'Alice' or 'Bob'. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `arr` and return either 'Alice' or 'Bob'.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'Alice'

Case_2: The program returns 'Bob'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
