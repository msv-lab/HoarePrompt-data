Output State: **`A` is True, `not_c` is False**

The code `not_c = False` simply reassigns the value of `not_c` to `False`. The value of `A` remains unchanged as `True`, and the value of `not_c` is explicitly set to `False`. The precondition that `set_` must have at least 3 elements and `i` is 2 are not affected by this line of code.
