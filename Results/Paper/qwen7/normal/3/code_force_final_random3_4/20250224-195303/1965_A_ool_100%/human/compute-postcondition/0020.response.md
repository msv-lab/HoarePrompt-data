Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `len(set_)`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `A` is False.
   - `not_c` is False.
   - The loop checks if the element at index `i` in `set_` is greater than the element at index `i-1` by more than 1. If this condition is met, it breaks out of the loop.

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - The value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is `i`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.

4. **Check the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(set_)`.
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, the next valid value for `i` would be `i + 1`.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - `A` remains False because there is no information suggesting it changes within the loop.
   - `not_c` remains False for the same reason.
   - The new value for `i` is `i + 1`.

6. **Formulate the New State:**
   - The new state should reflect the updated value of `i` while keeping `A` and `not_c` unchanged.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`A` is False, `not_c` is False, `i` is `i + 1`**.
