Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `i` and `len(set_)`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(set_)`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `A` is True
   - `not_c` is False
   - `set_` must have at least 1 element
   - `i` is 1

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` (which is now 2) must be less than `len(set_)`. Therefore, `len(set_)` must be greater than 2.

5. **Update the state**:
   - `A` remains True
   - `not_c` remains False
   - `set_` must have at least 1 element, but to ensure the loop continues, it must have at least 3 elements (since `i` is now 2).
   - `i` is updated to 2

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`A` is True, `not_c` is False, `set_` must have at least 3 elements, and `i` is 2**
