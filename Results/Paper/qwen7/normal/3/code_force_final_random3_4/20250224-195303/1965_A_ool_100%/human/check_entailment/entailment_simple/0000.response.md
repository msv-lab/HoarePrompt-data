Reasoning:

1. The problem requires determining the winner of a game based on the initial configuration of stone piles, assuming both players play optimally.
2. The annotated program reads the input correctly and calls the `func_1` function with the list of stone counts.
3. In `func_1`, the program first checks if the smallest pile has more than one stone. If so, Alice wins immediately.
4. Otherwise, the program constructs a sorted list of unique pile sizes and iterates through this list to check the gaps between consecutive pile sizes.
5. If any gap is greater than 1, the loop breaks, setting `not_c` to `False`.
6. The boolean `A` alternates between `True` and `False` with each iteration of the loop.
7. After the loop, if `not_c` is still `False`, `A` is toggled again.
8. Finally, the function returns 'Alice' if `A` is `True`, otherwise 'Bob'.

The logic in the annotated program matches the problem description and the rules of the game. The program correctly identifies the winner based on the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
