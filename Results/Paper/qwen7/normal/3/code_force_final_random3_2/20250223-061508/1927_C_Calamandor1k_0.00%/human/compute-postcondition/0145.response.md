Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers t, n, m, k, and two arrays a and b. For each test case, it counts the number of elements in arrays a and b that are less than or equal to k (up to the length of the longer array). If the count of such elements in both arrays is greater than or equal to k/2, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not modify the input arrays or any other global state.**
