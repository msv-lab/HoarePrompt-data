Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `b` is a list of integers, `len_a` is the length of list `a`, `len_b` is the length of list `b`**.

Explanation: The code calculates the lengths of two lists, `a` and `b`. However, the list `a` is not defined in the given initial state, so its length (`len_a`) cannot be determined. The length of list `b` (`len_b`) is calculated and stored in the variable `len_b`. The values of `t` and `b` remain unchanged from their initial state.
