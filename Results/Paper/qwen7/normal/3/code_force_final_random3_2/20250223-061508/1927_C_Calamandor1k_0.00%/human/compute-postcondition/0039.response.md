Output State: **`len_a` is at least 1, `count_a` is increased by 1, `len_b` must be greater than `i_prev + 3`, `count_b` is increased by 1 twice, and the condition `b[i_prev + 1] <= k` is still valid.**

Explanation: The code `count_b += 1` increments the value of `count_b` by 1. Since `count_b` was already increased by 1 before this line of code, it is now increased by 1 again, making it increased by 2 in total. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
