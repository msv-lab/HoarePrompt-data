Based on the initial state provided, we know the following:

- After the loop, `i` will be equal to `max(len_a, len_b)`.
- `count_a` will be a value between 0 and `min(len_a, max(len_a, len_b))` inclusive.
- `count_b` will be a value between 0 and `min(len_b, max(len_a, len_b))` inclusive.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `len_a`, `len_b`, and `d` will remain unchanged.

We need to determine whether `count_a >= d` and `count_b >= d` to decide whether to print 'YES' or 'NO'.

Given the constraints on `count_a` and `count_b`, both `count_a` and `count_b` can only take values up to `min(len_a, max(len_a, len_b))` and `min(len_b, max(len_a, len_b))` respectively. Since `max(len_a, len_b)` is the maximum length of either `len_a` or `len_b`, the minimum possible value for `d` is 0, and the maximum possible value for `d` is `min(len_a, max(len_a, len_b))` or `min(len_b, max(len_a, len_b))`.

However, without specific values for `count_a`, `count_b`, and `d`, we cannot definitively say whether `count_a >= d` and `count_b >= d` will be true or false. Therefore, the output will depend on the actual values of these variables.

Output: **'YES' if count_a >= d and count_b >= d else 'NO'**
