Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `a`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the new list `a` contains the integers obtained from the input.
