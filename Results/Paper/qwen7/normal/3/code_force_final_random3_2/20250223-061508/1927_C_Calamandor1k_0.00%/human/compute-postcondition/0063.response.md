Postcondition: `i` is 0, `len_a` is the length of list `a`, `len_b` is the length of list `b`, `count_a` is 1 if `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k` and the length of list `a` is greater than `i + 1`; otherwise, `count_a` remains unchanged, and the current value of `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k`.
