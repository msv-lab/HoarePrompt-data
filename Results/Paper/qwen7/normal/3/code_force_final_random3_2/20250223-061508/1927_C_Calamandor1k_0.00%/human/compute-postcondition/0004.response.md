Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `b` is a list of integers converted from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes user input, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `b`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, so it is still an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
