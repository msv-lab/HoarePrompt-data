Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, x is an input integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8, n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x**.

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `x` and `n`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and its condition (being a positive integer between 1 and 10^3) still holds. The values of `x` and `n` are updated to the integers read from the input, with the condition that `1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8` and `1 ≤ n ≤ x`.
