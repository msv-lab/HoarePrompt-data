Based on the initial state and the given conditions:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- `x` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\).
- `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq x\).
- `ans` is the maximum value between `ans` and `x // i` for all divisors `i` of `x` such that `n <= i` or `n <= x // i`.
- `i` has been incremented to `isqrt(x) + 1` after the loop completes.

The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the maximum value between `ans` and `x // i` for all divisors `i` of `x` such that `n <= i` or `n <= x // i`.

To determine the exact value of `ans`, we need to consider the logic of the loop and how `ans` is updated. However, since the exact value of `x`, `n`, and the initial value of `ans` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. But we know that `ans` will be the maximum value found during the iteration over the divisors of `x`.

Therefore, the output will be the maximum value of `x // i` for all divisors `i` of `x` such that `n <= i` or `n <= x // i`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the maximum value between ans and x // i for all divisors i of x such that n <= i or n <= x // i)**
