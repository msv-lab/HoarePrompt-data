Reasoning:

1. The program is designed to handle multiple test cases, which matches the problem statement.
2. For each test case, the program reads two integers \(x\) and \(n\).
3. It then iterates over all divisors \(i\) of \(x\) using `isqrt(x) + 1` to ensure all divisors are checked.
4. If \(i\) is a divisor of \(x\), it checks two conditions:
   - \(n \leq x // i\)
   - \(n \leq i\)
5. If either condition is true, it updates `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and \(i\) or \(x // i\).
6. Finally, it prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

This logic aims to find the maximum balance (GCD) of the difficulties of the sub-problems. The approach correctly considers all possible ways to split \(x\) into \(n\) parts and ensures that the GCD of these parts is maximized.

Given the execution summary and the provided example, the program appears to correctly implement the solution.

Correctness: **True**
