Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq x\), `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and either `x // i` (if `n <= i`) or remains unchanged (if `n > i`), and `i` is incremented to `i + 1` where `i` is the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration and `i + 1 <= isqrt(x)\).

This means that after the if-else block executes, `t` remains within the range of \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` remains within the range of \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\), `n` remains within the range of \(1 \leq n \leq x\), and `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and either `x // i` if `n <= i` or remains unchanged if `n > i`. Additionally, `i` is incremented to `i + 1` as long as `i + 1` is less than or equal to the integer square root of `x`.
