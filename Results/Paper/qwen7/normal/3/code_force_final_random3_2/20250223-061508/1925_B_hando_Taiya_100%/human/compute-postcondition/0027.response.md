Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), `x` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\), `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq x\), `ans` is the maximum of `ans` and `i`, and `i` is incremented to `i + 1` where `i + 1 <= isqrt(x)**

Explanation: The code updates `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and `i`. It also increments `i` by 1, ensuring that `i + 1` is less than or equal to the integer square root of `x`. The values of `t`, `x`, `n`, and `i + 1` are updated, while the conditions and values of `ans` are adjusted accordingly.
