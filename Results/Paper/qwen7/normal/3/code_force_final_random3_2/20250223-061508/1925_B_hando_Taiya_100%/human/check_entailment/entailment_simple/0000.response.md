Reasoning:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n`.
3. It then calculates the maximum balance of the problemset by finding the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that either `n <= x // i` or `n <= i`. This is done using a loop that iterates from `1` to `isqrt(x) + 1`.
4. If `x % i == 0`, it checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i` or `i`, and updates `ans` accordingly.
5. Finally, it prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

The logic in the program is sound. The approach of iterating through the divisors of `x` and checking the conditions to find the maximum balance is correct. The use of `isqrt(x) + 1` ensures that we only check up to the square root of `x`, which is efficient.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly computes the maximum balance for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
