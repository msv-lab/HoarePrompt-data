Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by input integers \(t\), \(x\), and \(n\). For each test case, it calculates the maximum value between \(ans\) and \(x // i\) for all divisors \(i\) of \(x\) such that \(n \leq i\) or \(n \leq x // i\). After processing all test cases, it prints the final value of \(ans\).**
