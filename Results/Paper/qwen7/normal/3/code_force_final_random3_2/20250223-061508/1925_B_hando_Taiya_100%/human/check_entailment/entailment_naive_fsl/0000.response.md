Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum balance of the problemset. Specifically, the program only checks divisors of `x` and does not ensure that the number of sub-problems `n` is used optimally. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input: 
  ```
  3
  12 4
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  3
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  2
  ```

In this case, the optimal solution would be to split the problem of difficulty 12 into four sub-problems with difficulties 3, 3, 3, and 3, which gives a balance of 3. However, the program only checks divisors and does not ensure that the number of sub-problems `n` is used optimally. Therefore, the program fails to handle this case correctly.
