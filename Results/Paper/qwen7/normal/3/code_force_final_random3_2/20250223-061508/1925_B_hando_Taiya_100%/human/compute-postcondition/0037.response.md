Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases through input values t, x, and n, where t is a positive integer between 1 and 10^3, and for each test case, x and n are positive integers between 1 and 10^8 and 1 and x respectively. It processes these inputs and returns different outputs based on the given conditions.**

This means the function is expected to handle a series of test cases defined by the variable `t`, and for each test case, it processes two integers `x` and `n` to produce a result, though the specific nature of the result is not detailed in the provided information.
