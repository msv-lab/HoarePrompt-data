You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9. The function `generate` is assumed to be a generator function that yields all possible combinations of the prime factors of n.
def func_1(n):
    factors = {}
    nn = n
    i = 2
    while i * i <= nn:
        while nn % i == 0:
            factors[i] = factors.get(i, 0) + 1
            nn //= i
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `factors` is now {'2': 1, '3': 1, '4': 3}, `nn` is 0, `n` is equal to the original value of `n`, `i` is greater than `nn`.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `nn` will be reduced to 0 because it keeps getting divided by its factors until it can no longer be divided (i.e., when `nn % i == 0` no longer holds true for any `i`). The variable `factors` will contain the prime factorization of `n`, and `i` will be greater than `nn` since the loop continues as long as `i * i <= nn`. Given that the loop stops when `nn` becomes 0, `i` will be incremented beyond the point where further division is possible, making `i > nn`.
    if (nn > 1) :
        factors[nn] = factors.get(nn, 0) + 1
    #State: `factors` contains the prime factorization of `n`, `nn` is 1, `n` is equal to the original value of `n`, and `i` is greater than `nn`.
    primes = list(factors.keys())
    for factor in generate(0):
        yield factor
        
    #State: Output State: The loop continues yielding factors from the `generate(0)` function until it can no longer produce any more factors. At this point, `factor` will hold the last value yielded by `generate(0)`, indicating that there are no further factors to process. 
    #
    #In this final state, `primes` will contain all the prime factors of `n`, `nn` will be equal to the product of all these prime factors (i.e., `n`), and `i` will still be greater than `nn`. However, since the loop has completed, `factor` will no longer be yielded and will hold the last factor processed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `n` within the range of 1 to 10^9, and returns all possible combinations of its prime factors using a generator function `generate`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
