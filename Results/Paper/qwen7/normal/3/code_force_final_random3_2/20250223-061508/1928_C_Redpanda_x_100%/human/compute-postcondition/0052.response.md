The only object in the loop head is the variable `factor`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the generator `generate(0)` yielding another value. At the end of the last iteration, `factor` is the next value yielded by `generate(0)`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `factor` must be the next value yielded by `generate(0)`.

State: **`factor` is the next value yielded by `generate(0)`**
