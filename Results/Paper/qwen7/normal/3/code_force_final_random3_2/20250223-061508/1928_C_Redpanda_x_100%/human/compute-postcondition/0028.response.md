Output State: **`factor` is `prime`, `prime_to_i` is `prime * prime * prime_to_i`, `rest` remains unchanged, and `factors[prime]` is 2.**

Explanation: The line `prime_to_i *= prime` multiplies the current value of `prime_to_i` by `prime`. Given that `prime_to_i` was originally `prime * prime_to_i`, after executing the line, `prime_to_i` becomes `prime * (prime * prime_to_i)`, which simplifies to `prime * prime * prime_to_i`. The other variables (`factor`, `rest`, and `factors[prime]`) remain unchanged.
