Output State: **`prime_to_i` is now `(prime_to_i * prime) * prime`, `factor * prime_to_i` is yielded, `factors[prime]` is at least 1, `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded.**

Explanation: The line `prime_to_i *= prime` multiplies the current value of `prime_to_i` by `prime`. Therefore, `prime_to_i` is updated to `(prime_to_i * prime) * prime`. The other variables remain unchanged as no operation was performed on them.
