Output State: **`rest` is the result of calling `generate(k + 1)`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, each test case consists of two integers n and x such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and k is not equal to the length of the list primes.**

The code `rest = generate(k + 1)` assigns the result of the function `generate(k + 1)` to the variable `rest`. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
