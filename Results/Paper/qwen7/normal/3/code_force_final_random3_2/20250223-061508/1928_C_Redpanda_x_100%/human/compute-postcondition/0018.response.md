Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for factor in rest:`. The variables involved in the loop head are `factor` and `rest`.

2. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime`.
   - This information is not directly relevant to the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements in `rest`.
   - After each iteration, `factor` takes the value of the current element from `rest`.

4. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `rest` must still contain at least one element.
   - After the loop body is executed, `factor` will take the value of the first element in `rest`.

5. **State Adjustment**:
   - Since `rest` must still contain at least one element for the loop to continue, we can assume `rest` is not empty.
   - After the loop body, `factor` will be set to the first element of `rest`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `rest` is not empty and `factor` is set to the first element of `rest`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`prime_to_i` is equal to `prime`, `rest` is a non-empty list, `factor` is the first element in `rest`**
