Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. According to the problem description, the key to determining Bob's wins lies in the bitwise XOR of the sequence. The current implementation uses a formula that does not accurately reflect this logic.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the parity of the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s. Specifically, we need to ensure that after each removal, the XOR of the remaining numbers results in zero for Bob to win. The given solution does not account for this logic and instead uses a formula that does not relate to the XOR operation or the game's winning condition.

A correct approach would involve calculating the parity of the counts and using it to determine the optimal moves for Bob. The current implementation does not do this, making it incorrect.
