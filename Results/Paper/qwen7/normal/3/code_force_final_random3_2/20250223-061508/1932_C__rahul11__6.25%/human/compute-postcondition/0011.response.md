Output State: **`ans` is equal to the current value of `ans` multiplied by the next element in `arr`, and `i` is the next element of `arr`.**

Explanation: The code `ans *= i` multiplies the current value of `ans` by the next element in `arr` and assigns the result back to `ans`. The value of `i` remains the next element of `arr`. The precondition that `ans` is equal to the current value of `ans` multiplied by the next element in `arr` and `i` is the next element of `arr` is still valid after the code execution.
