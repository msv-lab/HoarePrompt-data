Output State: **`arr` must contain at least one element; ans is the product of all elements in arr.**

Explanation: The code `ans *= i` multiplies the current value of `ans` by the value of `i`. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, it implies that `i` is likely an element from the array `arr`. After executing this line, `ans` will hold the cumulative product of all elements in `arr` up to the point where `i` was used. The precondition that `arr` must contain at least one element remains valid.
