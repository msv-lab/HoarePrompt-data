Postcondition: `k`, `ans`, `res[c]`, `n`, `r`, and `c` are as follows:
- If `s[k]` is 'L', then `k` is 2, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[1] % MOD`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `n` is the number of elements in the array, `r` is decremented by 1 if `s[k]` is not 'L', and `c` is incremented by 1.
- Otherwise, `k` is 1, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD - 1`, `n` is the number of elements in the array, `r` is decremented by 1 if `s[k]` is not 'L', and `c` is incremented by 1.
