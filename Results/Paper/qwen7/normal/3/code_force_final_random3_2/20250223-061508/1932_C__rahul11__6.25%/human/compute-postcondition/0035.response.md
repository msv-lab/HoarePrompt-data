Output State: **`k` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans` is `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `r` is `r - 1`**

Explanation: The code `ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD` updates the value of `ans` by performing integer division by `arr[r]` and then taking modulo `MOD`. The values of `k`, `n`, and the condition for `res[c]` remain unchanged. Additionally, `r` is decremented by 1.
