Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly initializes variables and reads the necessary inputs.
2. It calculates the initial product of the array elements and stores it in `ans`.
3. The program then iterates through the string `s` and updates `ans` based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'.
4. For each command, it computes the remainder of `ans` when divided by `m` and stores it in the result list `res`.
5. The program ensures that `ans` is updated correctly by dividing it by the appropriate element of the array (`arr[l]` for 'L' and `arr[r]` for 'R`).
6. The final value of `ans` after processing all commands is stored in `res[n-1]`, which matches the expected output format.
7. The use of `MOD` ensures that the intermediate results do not overflow.
8. The program handles the edge cases where the array becomes empty after processing all commands.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
