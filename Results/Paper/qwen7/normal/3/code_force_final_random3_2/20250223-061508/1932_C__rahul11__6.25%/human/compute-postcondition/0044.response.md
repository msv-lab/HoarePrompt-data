Output State: **`k` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans` is `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `l` is 3, `r` is `r - 1`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `c` is 1, `res[1]` is calculated and stored, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD**.

Explanation: The line `l += 1` increments the value of `l` by 1. Initially, `l` was 2, so after executing this line, `l` becomes 3. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
