Output State: **`k` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans` is `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `l` is 2, `r` is `r - 1`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `c` is 1, `res[1]` is calculated and stored, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD**.

Explanation: The code updates `res[c]` to `ans % m % MOD`. Since `c` is 1, `res[1]` is now equal to `ans % m % MOD`. Additionally, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, where `l` is 2. The values of `k`, `n`, `l`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged.
