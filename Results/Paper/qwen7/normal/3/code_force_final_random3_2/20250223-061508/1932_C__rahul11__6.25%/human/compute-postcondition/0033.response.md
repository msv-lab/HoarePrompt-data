Output State: **`k` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `ans` is `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `l` is 1, `r` is `r - 1`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `ans % m % MOD` to `res[c]`. Since the initial values of the other variables (`k`, `n`, `ans`, `l`, `r`) do not change, they remain the same. The new value of `res[c]` is calculated based on the current value of `ans`, `m`, and `MOD`.
