Output State: **`arr` must contain at least one element, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `ans` is the product of the current `ans` and `i`.**

Explanation: The code `ans *= i` multiplies the current value of `ans` by the value of `i`. Since `i` is the next element in `arr`, and `ans` was previously the product of the current `ans` and `i`, after executing the code, `ans` will now be the product of the previous `ans` and `i` squared (since `i` is taken from `arr` again). However, without knowing the exact values of `arr` and `i`, we can only state that `ans` is updated to be the product of its previous value and `i`. The precondition that `arr` must contain at least one element and `i` is the next element in `arr` remains valid.
