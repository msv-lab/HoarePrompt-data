Output State: **`k` is 2, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD - 1`, `n` is the number of elements in the array, `r` is `r - 1`, `c` is `c + 2`, `res[c]` is now `ans % m % MOD**.

Explanation: The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously updated states.
