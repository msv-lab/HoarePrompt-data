Output State: **`n` is 1, `m` is the second integer input by the user.**

Explanation: The initial state had `int(input())` as 1, which means the first integer input was 1, assigned to `n`. The code then reads two integers from input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively using the `map(int, input().split())` function. Since the first integer (assigned to `n`) was already known to be 1, the second integer is assigned to `m`. The value of `n` remains 1, and `m` takes the value of the second integer input by the user.
