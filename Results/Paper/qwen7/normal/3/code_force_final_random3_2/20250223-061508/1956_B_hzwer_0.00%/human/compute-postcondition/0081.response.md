Postcondition: `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `n - 1`, and `dp[i][j]` is updated as follows: if `j + 1` does not appear in `cards`, then `dp[i][j]` is `dp[i + 1][j]`; if `j + 1` appears exactly once in `cards`, then `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`; otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.
