Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `dp` is a 2D list of zeros with dimensions (n+1) x (n+1); `dp[n - 2][0]` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 3, -1, -1):
    for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if cards.count(j + 1) == 0:
            dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]
        elif cards.count(j + 1) == 1:
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)
        else:
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1]
                )


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: The loop will have executed for all iterations, meaning `j` will start from `n-1` and decrement until it reaches `-1`. After all iterations, `dp[i][j]` will hold the maximum value calculated for each cell in the `dp` table based on the conditions provided within the loop. Specifically, for each cell `dp[i][j]`, the value will be determined as follows:

- If `j + 1` does not appear in `cards`, then `dp[i][j]` will be set to `dp[i + 1][j]`.
- If `j + 1` appears exactly once in `cards`, then `dp[i][j]` will be set to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`.
- If `j + 1` appears more than once in `cards`, then `dp[i][j]` will be set to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.

This final state represents the optimal solution for the problem being solved by the loop, where `dp[i][j]` contains the maximum possible value that can be achieved starting from index `i` with the given constraints on the `cards` list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Output State: The final state of `dp[i][j]` after the loop executes all its iterations is determined by the following rules:

For each `j` starting from `n-1` down to `0`:
- If there are no occurrences of `j + 1` in the list `cards`, then `dp[i][j]` is set to `dp[i + 1][j]`.
- If there is exactly one occurrence of `j + 1` in `cards`, then `dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum value between `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`.
- If there are more than one occurrences of `j + 1` in `cards`, then `dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum value among `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.

This process is repeated for each `j` from `n-1` down to `0`, and the loop continues until `j` reaches `0`. The final state of `dp[i][j]` reflects the maximum possible value achievable under the given conditions for each `j` across all iterations of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: The loop will continue to execute until `i` is no longer incremented, which happens when `i` becomes equal to the length of the `dp` list (considering `i` starts from the last index of `dp`). At this point, `j` will be `-1` because the loop decrements `j` from `n-1` to `0`. For all valid indices `i` and `j`, `dp[i][j]` will hold the maximum value calculated according to the conditions specified in the loop body, considering the counts of `j + 1` in the `cards` list.

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop, `i` will be set to the index just before the first element of `dp`, `j` will be `-1`, and `dp[i][j]` will contain the final computed value based on the given conditions over all elements in `dp`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
