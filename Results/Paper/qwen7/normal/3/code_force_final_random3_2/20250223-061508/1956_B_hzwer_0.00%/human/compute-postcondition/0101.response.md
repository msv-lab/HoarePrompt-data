Output State: **The final state of `dp[i][j]` will be the maximum value achievable for each cell based on the conditions provided in the loop.**

Natural Language Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the `dp` table will be filled with the maximum values that can be achieved starting from each index `i` and for each `j` up to `n-1`. This value is determined by checking the count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list and applying the appropriate condition to update `dp[i][j]`. The final state of `dp[i][j]` for each valid pair `(i, j)` will reflect the optimal solution for the problem, ensuring that the maximum value is computed based on the given constraints.
