Output State: After the loop executes all its iterations, `i` will be equal to `i + n`, assuming `i` starts from 0. The variable `n` will be reduced to 0 after the loop completes. The variable `j` will be `-1` because the loop decrements `j` from `n-1` to `0` and continues until `j` becomes `-1`. The `dp` table will be fully populated based on the logic defined within the loop. Specifically, for each cell `dp[i][j]`, it will hold the maximum value calculated according to the conditions provided: if `j + 1` does not appear in `cards`, then `dp[i][j]` will be `dp[i + 1][j]`; if `j + 1` appears exactly once in `cards`, then `dp[i][j]` will be the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`; otherwise, `dp[i][j]` will be the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.

In summary, after all iterations, `i` will be `i + n`, `n` will be `0`, `j` will be `-1`, and `dp` will contain the computed values following the specified rules.
