Postcondition: `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `n - 3`, and `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1` if the count of `j + 1` in `cards` is zero, otherwise `dp[i][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.
