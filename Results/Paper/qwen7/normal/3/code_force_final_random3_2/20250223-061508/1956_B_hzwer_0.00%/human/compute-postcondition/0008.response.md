Output State: **`total` is 0, `students_list` is a list of students, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is `n-1`, and `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`.**

The code updates the value of `dp[i][j]` to be equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. The other variables (`total`, `students_list`, `n`, `j`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
