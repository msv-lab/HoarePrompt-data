Output State: **`total` is 0, `students_list` is a list of students, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is `n-2`, and `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`**.

The code `dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]` updates the value of `dp[i][j]` to be the same as `dp[i + 1][j]`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
