Output State: **`dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`.**

Explanation: The given code updates `dp[i][j]` to be equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. This means that the value of `dp[i][j]` is directly set to the value of `dp[i + 1][j]`, without considering the conditions related to the count of `j + 1` in `cards`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
