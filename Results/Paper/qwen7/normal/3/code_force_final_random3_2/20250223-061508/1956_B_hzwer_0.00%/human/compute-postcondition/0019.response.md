Output State: **`dp[i][j]` is equal to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, `j` is `n-2`, `total` is 0, `students_list` is a list of students, and `dp[i][j]` remains `dp[i + 1][j]` if `j + 1` does not appear more than once in `cards`.**

Explanation: The code updates `dp[i][j]` to be the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. This means `dp[i][j]` is now specifically set to the maximum of these two values. The other variables (`total`, `students_list`, `n`, and `j`) remain unchanged, and the condition regarding `dp[i][j]` being equal to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]` if `j + 1` appears more than once in `cards` still holds, but since the code only sets it to the maximum of the first two, this condition is not directly reflected in the output state.
