Postcondition: `dp[i][j]` is calculated as follows: 
- If the count of `j + 1` in `cards` is exactly 1, then `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`.
- Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.
- `j` is `n-1`, and the count of `j + 1` in `cards` is not equal to 0.
