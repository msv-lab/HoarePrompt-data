Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `j`.
   - The loop runs in reverse from `n-1` to `0`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `j` is greater than or equal to 0.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `i + 1`.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `j` is `n - 1`.
   - `dp[i][j]` is updated based on conditions involving `cards`.

4. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop decrements `j` by 1 each time, the next value of `j` will be `j - 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `j` must still be greater than or equal to 0.

5. **Update the State:**
   - `i` remains `i + 1` (unchanged).
   - `n` remains greater than 0 (unchanged).
   - `j` becomes `j - 1`.
   - `dp[i][j]` will be updated based on the new value of `j` and the conditions provided.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `j` is `n - 2` (since `j` was `n - 1` and it decreases by 1).
- `dp[i][j]` will be updated based on the new value of `j`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is `n - 2`, and `dp[i][j]` is updated based on the conditions provided.**
