Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given for loop is `j` and it iterates from `n - 1` to `0` in reverse order.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `j` is within the specified range (`n - 1` to `0`).

3. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - **Variable `j`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was `n - 2`. For the loop to continue, `j` must decrease by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `n - 3`.
   - **Variable `n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop head.
   - **Variable `dp`**: The value of `dp[i][j]` is determined based on the conditions provided, but since the loop head only involves `j`, the specific value of `dp[i][j]` does not change directly due to the loop itself. However, the condition for updating `dp[i][j]` is based on the current value of `j`.

Given these points, we can conclude the following adjustments needed for the next iteration:

- `j` decreases by 1, so `j` becomes `n - 3`.
- `n` remains the same.
- The postcondition for `dp[i][j]` will depend on the new value of `j`, but the specific value of `dp[i][j]` is not directly adjusted here.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `total` is 0, `students_list` is a list of students, `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is `n - 3`, and `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]` if `j + 1` does not appear in `cards`. Otherwise, `dp[i][j]` is equal to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.**
