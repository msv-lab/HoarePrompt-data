Postcondition: `dp[i][j]` is calculated based on the following conditions: 
- If the count of `j + 1` in `cards` is 0, then `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`.
- If the count of `j + 1` in `cards` is exactly 1, then `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`.
- If the count of `j + 1` in `cards` is greater than 1, then `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.
- `j` is `n-1` throughout the process.
