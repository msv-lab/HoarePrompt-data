Output State: The final state of `dp[i][j]` after the loop executes all its iterations is determined by the following rules:

For each `j` starting from `n-1` down to `0`:
- If there are no occurrences of `j + 1` in the list `cards`, then `dp[i][j]` is set to `dp[i + 1][j]`.
- If there is exactly one occurrence of `j + 1` in `cards`, then `dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum value between `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`.
- If there are more than one occurrences of `j + 1` in `cards`, then `dp[i][j]` is set to the maximum value among `dp[i + 1][j]`, `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[i + 1][j + 1]`.

This process is repeated for each `j` from `n-1` down to `0`, and the loop continues until `j` reaches `0`. The final state of `dp[i][j]` reflects the maximum possible value achievable under the given conditions for each `j` across all iterations of the loop.
