### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the logic of the program and verifies it against the provided test cases. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.

2. **Conditions for "YES"**:
   - The program checks if `x < k - 1`:
     - If true, it checks if `a >= x + 1`. If so, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
   - If `x == k - 1`, it checks if `a >= x + 3`. If so, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
   - If `x > k - 1`, it calculates `z` using the formula:
     ```python
     z = 0
     for i in range(x + 1):
         z += z // (k - 1) + 1
     ```
     It then checks if `a >= z`. If so, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

3. **Verification Against Test Cases**:
   - The program's logic aligns with the problem description and correctly handles all test cases provided.

4. **Calculation of `z`**:
   - The calculation of `z` is done iteratively, and the logic ensures that Sasha can achieve the desired number of coins if the conditions are met.

Given the detailed analysis and verification against the test cases, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**

The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases.
