Postcondition: `i` is equal to `x`, `x` is a non-negative integer, and `z` is the sum of `z` initialized to 0 plus the value of `z // (k - 1) + 1` added for each iteration from 0 to `x`. Additionally, if `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, then the value of `a` remains unchanged; otherwise, `a` is less than `z`.
