Output State: `i` is equal to `x`, `x` must be a non-negative integer, `z` is the sum of `z` after each iteration of the loop, which can be expressed as `z = (x + 1) * (z // (k - 1) + 1) - 1`.

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the initial value of `x`. The variable `z` will be updated in each iteration according to the formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1`. Therefore, the final value of `z` will be `(x + 1) * (z // (k - 1) + 1) - 1`. This formula accounts for the cumulative effect of adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` in each of the `x + 1` iterations.
