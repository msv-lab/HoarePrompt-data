Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` is greater than `k - 1`, `z` is 1**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `z` by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to it. Given that `z` is initially 0, `z // (k - 1)` is also 0 (since 0 divided by any non-zero number is 0). Therefore, `z` becomes `0 + 0 + 1`, which is 1. The values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged.
