Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for determining if Sasha can achieve his goal is flawed. Let's consider the following test case:

**Test Case:**
```
3 3 1
```

Here, `k = 3`, `x = 3`, and `a = 1`. According to the problem description, Sasha can lose up to `x` times in a row. However, if Sasha loses 3 times in a row, he will be unable to place any more bets because his current number of coins (`a`) is less than the required bet amount (`3`).

The program logic does not account for this scenario correctly. For instance, in the given solution, it checks if `a >= z` where `z` is calculated based on the number of consecutive losses allowed. However, this calculation does not fully capture the requirement that Sasha needs to have enough coins to place a bet after each loss.

To illustrate, let's break down the logic for `k = 3`, `x = 3`, and `a = 1`:

1. Sasha starts with 1 coin.
2. If he loses the first bet, he will have 0 coins.
3. If he loses the second bet, he will be unable to place the third bet because he has no coins left.

Thus, the program incorrectly outputs 'YES' for this case, which violates the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
