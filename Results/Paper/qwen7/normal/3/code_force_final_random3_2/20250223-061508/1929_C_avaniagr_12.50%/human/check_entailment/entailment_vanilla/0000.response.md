Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.

2. **Conditions for "YES"**:
   - The program checks if `x < k - 1`:
     - If true, it checks if `a >= x + 1`. If so, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
   - If `x == k - 1`, it checks if `a >= x + 3`. If so, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
   - If `x > k - 1`, it calculates `z` using the formula:
     ```python
     z = 0
     for i in range(x + 1):
         z += z // (k - 1) + 1
     ```
     It then checks if `a >= z`. If so, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Verification Against Test Cases

Let's verify the logic against the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case 1**: `k=2`, `x=1`, `a=7`
   - `x < k - 1` is true (`1 < 1` is false, but we check the next condition).
   - `x == k - 1` is false.
   - `x > k - 1` is false.
   - Calculation of `z` is unnecessary.
   - Since `a >= x + 1` (7 >= 2), it prints "YES".

2. **Test Case 2**: `k=2`, `x=1`, `a=1`
   - `x < k - 1` is true (`1 < 1` is false, but we check the next condition).
   - `x == k - 1` is false.
   - `x > k - 1` is false.
   - Calculation of `z` is unnecessary.
   - Since `a < x + 1` (1 < 2), it prints "NO".

3. **Test Case 3**: `k=2`, `x=3`, `a=15`
   - `x < k - 1` is false.
   - `x == k - 1` is false.
   - `x > k - 1` is true.
   - Calculation of `z`:
     ```python
     z = 0
     for i in range(4):  # x+1 = 4
         z += z // 1 + 1  # z // 1 + 1 = z + 1
     z = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4
     ```
   - Since `a >= z` (15 >= 4), it prints "YES".

4. **Test Case 4**: `k=3`, `x=3`, `a=6`
   - `x < k - 1` is false.
   - `x == k - 1` is false.
   - `x > k - 1` is true.
   - Calculation of `z`:
     ```python
     z = 0
     for i in range(4):  # x+1 = 4
         z += z // 2 + 1  # z // 2 + 1 = (z // 2) + 1
     z = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4
     ```
   - Since `a < z` (6 < 4), it prints "NO".

5. **Test Case 5**: `k=4`, `x=4`, `a=5`
   - `x < k - 1` is false.
   - `x == k - 1` is true.
   - Since `a < x + 3` (5 < 7), it prints "NO".

6. **Test Case 6**: `k=5`, `x=4`, `a=7`
   - `x < k - 1` is false.
   - `x == k - 1` is true.
   - Since `a < x + 3` (7 < 7), it prints "NO".

7. **Test Case 7**: `k=4`, `x=88`, `a=1000000000`
   - `x < k - 1` is false.
   - `x == k - 1` is false.
   - `x > k - 1` is true.
   - Calculation of `z`:
     ```python
     z = 0
     for i in range(89):  # x+1 = 89
         z += z // 3 + 1  # z // 3 + 1 = (z // 3) + 1
     ```
     This calculation results in a very large value, much larger than `1000000000`.
   - Since `a >= z` (1000000000 >= z), it prints "YES".

8. **Test Case 8**: `k=25`, `x=69`, `a=231`
   - `x < k - 1` is false.
   - `x == k - 1` is false.
   - `x > k - 1` is true.
   - Calculation of `z`:
     ```python
     z = 0
     for i in range(70):  # x+1 = 70
         z += z // 24 + 1  # z // 24 + 1 = (z // 24) + 1
     ```
     This calculation results in a very large value, much larger than `231`.
   - Since `a < z` (231 < z), it prints "NO".

9. **Test Case 9**: `k=13`, `x=97`, `a=18806`
   - `x < k - 1` is false.
   - `x == k - 1` is false.
   - `x > k - 1` is true.
   - Calculation of `z`:
     ```python
     z = 0
     for i in range(98):  # x+1 = 98
         z += z // 12 + 1  # z // 12 + 1 = (z // 12) + 1
     ```
     This calculation results in a very large value, much larger than `18806`.
   - Since `a < z` (18806 < z), it prints "NO".
