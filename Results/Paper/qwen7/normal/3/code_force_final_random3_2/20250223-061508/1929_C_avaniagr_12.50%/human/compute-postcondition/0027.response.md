Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `x`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `x + 1`.
3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `x` is greater than `k - 1`
   - `z` is 1

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increases by 1 each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 1.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` (which is now 1) must still be less than `x + 1`. Therefore, `x` must be greater than 0.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `i` is 1
- `x` is greater than 0 (since it was previously greater than `k - 1`, this condition is still satisfied)
- `z` remains unchanged at 1

So, the updated state is:

**State: `i` is 1, `x` is greater than 0, `z` is 1**
