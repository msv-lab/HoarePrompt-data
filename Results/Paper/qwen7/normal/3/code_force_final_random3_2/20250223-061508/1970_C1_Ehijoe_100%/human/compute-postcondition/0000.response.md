Output State: **`t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ `u`, `v` ≤ `n`, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2×10^5; `n` is updated to the integer input from the user, and `t` is updated to the integer input from the user.**

Explanation: The code `n, t = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `t` respectively. Since the initial state specified that `t` is 1, the value of `t` remains 1 after the input. The initial constraints on `n` and the ranges for `u` and `v` are preserved, but `n` is updated to the value entered by the user.
