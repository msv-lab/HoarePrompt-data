Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ `u`, `v` ≤ `n`, `n` is an integer input from the user, and `edges` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `edges`. The values of `t`, `u`, `v`, and `n` are updated to the integer inputs from the user. The other conditions and constraints on `u`, `v`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, `u` and `v` are still integers such that 1 ≤ `u`, `v` ≤ `n`, and `n` is an integer input from the user. The variable `edges` is now an empty list.
