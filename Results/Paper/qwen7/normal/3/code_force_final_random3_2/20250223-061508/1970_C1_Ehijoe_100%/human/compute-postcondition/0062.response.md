Output State: **`prev` is equal to `nodes[curr][1]`, `curr` is `nodes[curr][0]`, `s` is the first element from the `ends` list, `e` is the second element from the `ends` list, `curr` is not equal to `e`, `tree` now includes `curr` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `curr` to `nodes[curr][0]`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `prev` remains equal to `nodes[curr][1]`, `s` remains the first element from the `ends` list, `e` remains the second element from the `ends` list, `curr` is now `nodes[curr][0]`, `curr` is not equal to `e`, and `tree` now includes `curr` appended to it.
