Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `nodes[v]` now contains `[u]`**.

Explanation: The code `nodes[v].append(u)` appends the value of `u` to the list stored in `nodes[v]`. Initially, `nodes[v]` contains the value of `v`. After executing the code, `nodes[v]` will contain `[v, u]`. However, since `v` was already in the list, the updated state is that `nodes[v]` now contains `[u]` (assuming `u` is different from `v`). All other variables remain unchanged.
