Output State: **`prev` is equal to `nodes[curr][1]`, `curr` is `nodes[curr][1]`, `s` is the first element from the `ends` list, `e` is the second element from the `ends` list, `curr` is not equal to `e`, `tree` now includes `curr` appended to it, `curr` is updated to `nodes[curr][1]`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `curr` to `nodes[curr][1]`. All other variables (`prev`, `s`, `e`, and `tree`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
