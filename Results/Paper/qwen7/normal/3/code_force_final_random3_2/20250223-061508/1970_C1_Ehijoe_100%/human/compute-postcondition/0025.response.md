Output State: **`nodes` must have at least one key; `ends` contains the key that was appended**

Explanation: The code `ends.append(key)` appends the `key` to the list associated with the key in the `ends` variable. Since `nodes` must have at least one key, its state remains unchanged. The `ends` variable now includes the key that was just appended.
