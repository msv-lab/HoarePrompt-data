Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies a set of predefined conditions (n, t, u, v) with specific constraints and returns either nothing or a value based on those conditions.**

Given the constraints:
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\),
- `t` is an integer such that \(t = 1\),
- `u` and `v` are integers such that \(1 \leq u, v \leq n\),
- The list of integers for the starting node(s) has exactly one element.

The function does not explicitly accept any parameters but works under the assumption of these predefined conditions. The functionality of the function can be described as determining a relationship or performing an operation based on the given constraints involving `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, and the starting node(s) list. However, without further details on the operations or return type, the exact nature of the function's output cannot be specified beyond these constraints.
