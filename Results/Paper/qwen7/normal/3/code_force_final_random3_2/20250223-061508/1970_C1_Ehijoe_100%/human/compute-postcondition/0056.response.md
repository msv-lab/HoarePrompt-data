Postcondition: **`prev` is equal to `curr` appended to `tree`, `curr` is `nodes[curr][1]`, `s` is the first element from the `ends` list, `e` is the second element from the `ends` list, `tree` is a list containing `s`, `curr`, and `curr` is not equal to `e`.**

This means that after the execution of the if-else block, `prev` will be equal to `curr` appended to `tree`. Additionally, `curr` will be updated to `nodes[curr][1]` if the condition `nodes[curr][0] == prev` is true. If the condition is false, `prev` will be updated to `nodes[curr][0]`. The values of `s`, `e`, and the structure of `tree` remain as initially described in the precondition.
