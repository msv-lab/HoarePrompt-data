Output State: **`prev` is equal to `curr`, `s` is the first element from the `ends` list, `e` is the second element from the `ends` list, `tree` is a list containing all the nodes traversed from `s` to `e`, `curr` is equal to `e`, `idx` is the index of `start` in the `tree` list.**

Explanation: The code `idx = tree.index(start)` finds the index of `start` within the `tree` list. Since `start` is an input integer, its exact value is not specified, but it is now stored in the variable `idx`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
