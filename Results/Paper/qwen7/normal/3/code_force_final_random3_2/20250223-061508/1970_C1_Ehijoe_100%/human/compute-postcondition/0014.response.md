Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `nodes[u]` now contains `v`, `v` is assigned the value of the second input integer.**

Explanation: The code `nodes[u].append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `nodes[u]`. Initially, `u` is assigned the value of the first input integer, and `v` is assigned the value of the second input integer. After executing the code, `nodes[u]` will contain both the original value of `u` (which is the first input integer) and the new value of `v` (which is the second input integer). The other variables remain unchanged.
