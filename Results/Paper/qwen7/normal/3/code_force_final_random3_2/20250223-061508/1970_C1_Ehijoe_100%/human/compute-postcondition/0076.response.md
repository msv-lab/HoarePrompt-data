Based on the initial state provided:

- `prev` is equal to `curr`, which means `prev` and `curr` both refer to the same value.
- `s` is the first element from the `ends` list.
- `e` is the second element from the `ends` list.
- `tree` is a list containing all the nodes traversed from `s` to `e`.
- `curr` is equal to `e`, meaning `curr` refers to the second element from the `ends` list.
- `moves` is a list containing `[idx, n - idx - 1]`, where `idx` is the index of `start` in the `tree` list.
- All moves in the `moves` list are even numbers.

The `print` statement simply prints the string `'Hermione'`.

Output: **'Hermione'**
