Postcondition: `prev` is equal to `curr`, `s` is the first element from the `ends` list, `e` is the second element from the `ends` list, `tree` is a list containing `s` and `curr`, `curr` is `nodes[s][0]`, and `curr` is not equal to `e`. Additionally, if `nodes[curr][0]` is equal to the previous value of `prev`, then the value of `nodes[curr][1]` is updated to match the previous value of `prev`.
