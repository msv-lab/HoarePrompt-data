Output State: **The `ends` list contains all keys from `nodes` where the length of the list associated with each key is exactly 1.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the `ends` list will contain every key from the `nodes` dictionary where the value (a list) associated with that key has exactly one element. This is because the loop checks each key in `nodes`, and if the length of the list associated with that key is exactly 1, it appends that key to the `ends` list. The loop continues until there are no more keys left in `nodes` that satisfy the condition of having a list of length 1.
