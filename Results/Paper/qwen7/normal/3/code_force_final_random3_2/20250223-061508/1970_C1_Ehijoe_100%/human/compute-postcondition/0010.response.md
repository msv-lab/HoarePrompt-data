Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `u` is an input integer; `v` is an input integer; `nodes[u]` now contains `v`.**

In this code snippet, `nodes[u].append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `nodes[u]`. Since `u` and `v` are both input integers, the list `nodes[u]` will now include `v`. The other variables (`i`, `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
