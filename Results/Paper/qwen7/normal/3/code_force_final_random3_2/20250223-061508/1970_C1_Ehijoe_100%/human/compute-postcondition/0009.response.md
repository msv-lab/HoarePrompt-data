Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `u` is an input integer; `v` is an input integer**

Explanation: The code `u, v = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `u` and `v` respectively. The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `i` is still 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1. The values of `u` and `v` are the integers input by the user.
