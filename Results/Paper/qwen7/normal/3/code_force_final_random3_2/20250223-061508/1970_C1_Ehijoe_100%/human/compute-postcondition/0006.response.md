Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 0, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `nodes[u]` now contains `v`.**

In this code, `nodes[u].append(v)` appends the value of `v` to the list `nodes[u]`. Since `u` and `v` are both input integers, the list `nodes[u]` will now include the value of `v`. All other variables remain unchanged.
