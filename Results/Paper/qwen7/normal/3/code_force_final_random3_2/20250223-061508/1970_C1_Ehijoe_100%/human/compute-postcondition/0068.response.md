Output State: **`prev` is equal to `curr`, `s` is the first element from the `ends` list, `e` is the second element from the `ends` list, `tree` is a list containing all the nodes traversed from `s` to `e`, and `curr` is equal to `e`; `start` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `start = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to the variable `start`. The values of the other variables (`prev`, `curr`, `s`, `e`, `tree`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
