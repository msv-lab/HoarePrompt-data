Output State: **`prev` is `s`, `s` is the first element from the `ends` list, `e` is the second element from the `ends` list, `tree` is a list containing `s`.**

Explanation: The line `prev = s` assigns the value of `s` to the variable `prev`. Since `s` is initially the first element from the `ends` list, `prev` now holds the same value as `s`. The values of `e` and `tree` remain unchanged.
