Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ `u`, `v` ≤ `n`, `n` is an integer input from the user, and `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is set to True; `nodes` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list.**

The code initializes a `defaultdict` named `nodes` with the default factory set to `list`. This means that when a key is accessed in `nodes` that does not exist, it will automatically create an empty list for that key. The values of `t`, `u`, `v`, `n`, `edges`, and `empty` remain unchanged from their initial state.
