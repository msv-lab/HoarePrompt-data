Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `prev` is `s`, `s` is the first element from the `ends` list, `e` is the second element from the `ends` list, `tree` is a list containing `s`, `curr` is `nodes[s][0]`
Code of the loop:
while curr != e:
    tree.append(curr)
    if nodes[curr][0] == prev:
        prev = curr
        curr = nodes[curr][1]
    else:
        prev = curr
        curr = nodes[curr][0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `prev` is equal to `curr`, `s` is the first element from the `ends` list, `e` is the second element from the `ends` list, `tree` is a list containing `s` and `curr`, `curr` is `nodes[s][0]`, and `curr` is not equal to `e`. Additionally, if `nodes[curr][0]` is equal to the previous value of `prev`, then the current value of `nodes[curr][1]` is also equal to the previous value of `prev`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `prev` is equal to `curr` appended to `tree`, `curr` is `nodes[curr][1]`, `s` is the first element from the `ends` list, `e` is the second element from the `ends` list, `tree` is a list containing `s`, `curr`, and `curr` is not equal to `e`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: Postcondition: `prev` is equal to `nodes[curr][1]`, `curr` is updated to either `nodes[curr][0]` or `nodes[curr][1]`, `s` is the first element from the `ends` list, `e` is the second element from the `ends` list, `curr` is not equal to `e`, and `tree` now includes `curr` appended to it.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
