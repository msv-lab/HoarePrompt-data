Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing**: 
   - The program correctly initializes the number of test cases (`cases`) and iterates through each test case.
   - It correctly parses the number of people in front of Kirill (`na_frente`) and the maximum allowable final position (`pos_final`).
   - It correctly converts the input strings into lists of integers representing the costs (`custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`).

2. **Adjusting Indices**:
   - The indices `na_frente` and `pos_final` are correctly adjusted by subtracting 1, which is necessary because list indices in Python start at 0.

3. **Dynamic Programming Logic**:
   - The program uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the minimum cost to move from the current position to the target position.
   - It iterates backward from `na_frente` to 0, considering whether to swap or pass at each step.
   - The logic for updating the `total` cost and `best` cost is correct. It correctly handles the conditions for swapping and passing based on the respective costs.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum cost (`best`) for each test case after processing all positions.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. There are no apparent errors in the logic or implementation.

Correctness: **True**
