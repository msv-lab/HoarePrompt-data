Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from a new input split by spaces, `best` is set to `sys.float_info.max`, `cases` remains unchanged, `pos_final` is an input integer decreased by 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` remains unchanged, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an input integer decreased by 1, `total` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
    if v <= pos_final:
        if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
            best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
            total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
        else:
            total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
    elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
        total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
    else:
        total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Postcondition: `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from a new input split by spaces, `best` is set to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, otherwise `best` remains `sys.float_info.max`, `cases` remains unchanged, `pos_final` is an input integer decreased by 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` remains unchanged, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `total` is the minimum cumulative cost considering either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` based on which is smaller, and `v` is an integer within the bounds of `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `best` is the minimum cumulative cost considering either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` based on which is smaller, `cases` remains unchanged, `pos_final` is an input integer decreased by 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` remains unchanged, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is a non-negative integer, and `v` is an integer within the bounds of `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` and is decreased by 1. If `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `total` is updated to the minimum of `total` plus `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `total` plus `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. Otherwise, `total` is updated to the previous `total` plus the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `best` is the minimum cumulative cost considering either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` based on which is smaller, `cases` remains unchanged, `pos_final` is an input integer decreased by 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` remains unchanged, `c` is updated to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `v <= pos_final` and `best` is greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, otherwise `c` is 0, `na_frente` is a non-negative integer, and `v` is an integer within the bounds of `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` and is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
