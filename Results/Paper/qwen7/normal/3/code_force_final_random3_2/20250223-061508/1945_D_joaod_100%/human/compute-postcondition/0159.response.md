Output State: **`total` is now `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `na_frente` remains its initial value, `v` is `na_frente - 1`, and `best` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `total` by adding `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to it. The other variables (`na_frente`, `v`, and `best`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
