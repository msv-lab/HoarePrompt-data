Postcondition: `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from a new input split by spaces, `best` is either `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` if `best` was greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, or remains unchanged, `cases` remains unchanged, `pos_final` is an input integer decreased by 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` remains unchanged, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `total` is 0, and the value of `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, but `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is not less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.
