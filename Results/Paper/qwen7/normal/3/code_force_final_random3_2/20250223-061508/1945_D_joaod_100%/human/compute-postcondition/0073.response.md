Output State: **`custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from a new input split by spaces, `best` is now `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` because `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `cases` remains unchanged, `pos_final` is an input integer decreased by 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` remains unchanged, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is a non-negative integer, `total` is the previous value of `total` plus `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, and the value of `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`.**

In this output state, the `total` variable has been updated by adding the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously described states.
