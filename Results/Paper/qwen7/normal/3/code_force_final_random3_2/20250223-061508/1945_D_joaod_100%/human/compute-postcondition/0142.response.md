Output State: **`total` is now 0 plus the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`, `na_frente` remains its initial value, `v` is still `na_frente`, `v` is still greater than `pos_final`, and the current value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is still less than the current value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.**

This means that the value of `total` has been updated by adding the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to its initial value of 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial or previously determined states.
