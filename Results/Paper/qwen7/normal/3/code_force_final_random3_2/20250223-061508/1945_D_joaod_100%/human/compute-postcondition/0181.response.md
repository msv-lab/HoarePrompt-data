Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each case, it calculates the minimum cost to move from position `na_frente` to position `pos_final` using either direct swapping or passing. It considers two costs for each position: `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`. After processing all test cases, it prints the minimum cost for each case.**
