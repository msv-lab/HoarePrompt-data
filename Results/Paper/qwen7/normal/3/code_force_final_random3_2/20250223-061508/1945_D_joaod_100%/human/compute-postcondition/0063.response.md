Output State: **`custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from a new input split by spaces, `best` remains unchanged, `cases` remains unchanged, `pos_final` is an input integer decreased by 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` remains unchanged, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is an input integer decreased by 1.**

Explanation: The value of `pos_final` is decremented by 1. Initially, `pos_final` was an input integer. After decrementing, it becomes an input integer decreased by 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
