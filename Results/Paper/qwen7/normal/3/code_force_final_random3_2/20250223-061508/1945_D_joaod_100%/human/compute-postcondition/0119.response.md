Output State: **`na_frente` is an integer obtained from the first number input, `pos_final` is an integer obtained from the second number input, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers obtained from the subsequent input split and converted to integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers obtained from the current input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `custo_pra_passar_b = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores the resulting list in the variable `custo_pra_passar_b`. The values of `na_frente`, `pos_final`, and `custo_pra_trocar_a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
