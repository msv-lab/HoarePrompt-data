Output State: **`total` is now `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `na_frente` is its initial value, `v` is `na_frente`, and `best` is greater than or equal to `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`.**

Explanation: The variable `total` is incremented by the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. The other variables (`na_frente`, `v`, and `best`) remain unchanged from their initial or previous states.
