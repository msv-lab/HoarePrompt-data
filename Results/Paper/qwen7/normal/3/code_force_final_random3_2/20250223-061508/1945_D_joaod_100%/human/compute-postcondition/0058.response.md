Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is defined by the variable `c` and the range `range(cases)`. This means the only variable that changes within the loop is `c`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `c`**: Since the loop starts iterating from `c = 0` up to `c < cases`, at the start of the first iteration, `c` is 0.

3. **Adjust the State for the Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `c` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `c` will be 1.

4. **States That Need Adjustment**: The only state that needs adjustment is the value of `c`.

Given the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`total` is determined by the summation of either `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` or `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` for each iteration of `v` in the range from `na_frente` to -1, inclusive, `best` remains unchanged, `cases` remains unchanged, `na_frente` remains unchanged, `pos_final` remains unchanged, `custo_pra_trocar_a` remains unchanged, `custo_pra_passar_b` remains unchanged, `c` is 1**.
