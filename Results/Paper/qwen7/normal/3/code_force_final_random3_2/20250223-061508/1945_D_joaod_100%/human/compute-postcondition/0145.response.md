Output State: **`total` is 0 + custo_pra_passar_b[v], `na_frente` is its initial value, `v` is `na_frente`, and `v` is greater than `pos_final`, and the cost of swapping `a[v]` is greater than or equal to the cost of passing through `b[v]`**

Explanation: The code increments `total` by the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `total` is now `0 + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, while `na_frente`, `v`, and the condition regarding the costs remain the same.
