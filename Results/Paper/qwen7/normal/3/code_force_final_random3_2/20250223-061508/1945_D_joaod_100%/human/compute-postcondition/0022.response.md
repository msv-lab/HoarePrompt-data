Output State: **`total` is 0 + `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `cases` must be greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is `na_frente`, `pos_final` is `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers, `best` is the maximum float value, `v` is less than or equal to `pos_final`, `best` remains the maximum float value.**

This means that the variable `total` is updated by adding the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to its current value (which is 0). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
