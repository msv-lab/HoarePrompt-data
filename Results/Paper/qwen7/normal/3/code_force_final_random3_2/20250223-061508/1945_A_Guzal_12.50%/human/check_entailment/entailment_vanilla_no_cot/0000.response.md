Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of tents required. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Tent Allocation for Extroverts and Universals:**
   - The program tries to allocate tents for extroverts and universals using `(b + c) // 3` but this logic is flawed. Specifically, it doesn't handle cases where the remaining people cannot form a complete group of three.
   
2. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly:**
   - The condition `if (b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0:` is not sufficient to determine if it's impossible to accommodate everyone. For example, if there are 1 extrovert and 2 universals, it should still be possible to accommodate them in one tent, but the current logic would incorrectly return `-1`.

3. **Calculation of Remaining People:**
   - The program needs to ensure that after allocating tents for introverts and extroverts, the remaining universals can be accommodated. The current logic does not properly account for the remaining universals after initial allocations.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        k = 0
        
        # Allocate tents for introverts
        k += a
        
        # Allocate tents for extroverts
        if b > 0:
            k += b // 3
            c -= 2 * (b // 3)
        
        # Allocate tents for remaining universals
        if c >= 3:
            k += c // 3
            c %= 3
        
        # Check if remaining universals can be accommodated
        if c > 0:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(k)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that:
- Tents are allocated for introverts.
- Tents are allocated for extroverts.
- Remaining universals are accommodated.
- If there are any remaining universals that cannot be accommodated, it prints `-1`.
