Output State: **`i` is 1, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `k` is an integer, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from the input split by spaces**.

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input, splits it into three parts based on spaces, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to `a`, `b`, and `c`. The values of `i`, `k`, and the input method remain unchanged from the initial state.
