Output State: **`i` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `k` is `a + (b + c) // 3`**

Explanation: The code `a, b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively. It does not affect the values of `i` or `k`. The value of `k` remains unchanged as it was previously defined as `a + (b + c) // 3`.
