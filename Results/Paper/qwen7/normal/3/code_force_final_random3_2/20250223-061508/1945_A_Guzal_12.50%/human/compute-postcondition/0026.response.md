Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `a` is an input integer
   - `b` is an input integer
   - `c` is an input integer
   - The postcondition states that if `(b + c) % 3 != 0` and both `b % 3 != 0` and `c < 3`, then `k` is updated to `a + (b + c) // 3 + 1`. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged as `a + (b + c) // 3`.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since `i` is the only variable in the loop head, it is the only one that needs to be adjusted.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

5. **New State:**
   - `i` becomes 2.
   - `a`, `b`, `c`, and `k` remain unchanged unless the loop body updates them, but since the loop body is omitted, these values stay the same.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `k` is unchanged as `a + (b + c) // 3`**
