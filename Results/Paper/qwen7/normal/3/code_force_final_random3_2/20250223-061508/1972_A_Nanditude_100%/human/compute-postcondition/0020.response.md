Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head is defined by the variable `j` in the range `range(n)`. Therefore, the only variable that can be adjusted is `j`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `j`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Since `j` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.

5. **Verify other states**: The other states (`cnt`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `i`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is 2**
