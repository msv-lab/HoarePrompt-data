Output State: **`cnt` is increased by 1.**

The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Since the initial state is that `cnt` is increased by 1 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, and if `b[j]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`, then `i` is increased by 1, the only change here is to `cnt`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
