Output State: **`cnt` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `t` is decreased by 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input, and the current value of `b[j]` is less than the current value of `a[i]`.**

Explanation: The line `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Since `cnt` was initially 0, it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
