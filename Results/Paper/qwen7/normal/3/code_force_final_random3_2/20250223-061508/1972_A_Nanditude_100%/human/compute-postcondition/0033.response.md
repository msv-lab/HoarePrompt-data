Output State: **`cnt` is between 0 and n (inclusive), `t` is greater than 1, `n` is the new input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the input split and mapped to integers, `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is `n-1`**.

Explanation: The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer using the `map` function. The resulting list of integers replaces the previous value of `b`. All other variables (`cnt`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `j`) remain unchanged.
