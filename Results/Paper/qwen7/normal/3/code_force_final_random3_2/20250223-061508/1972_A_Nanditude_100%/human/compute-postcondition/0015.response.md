Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for j in range(n)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n`.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `cnt` is either 0 or 1.
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is 0.

4. **Determine the new state for the next iteration**:
   - Since the loop increments `j` by 1 in each iteration (though not explicitly shown, it is implied), at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 1.
   - Therefore, `j` should be 1 at the start of the next iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

5. **Adjust the other states**:
   - `cnt`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `n` remain the same as they are not directly affected by the loop incrementing `j`.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`cnt` is either 0 or 1, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `i` is 1, `j` is 1**
