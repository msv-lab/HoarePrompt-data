Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `j` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `j in range(n)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n`.

3. **Current States at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `cnt` is either 0 or 1.
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.
   - `i` is either 1 or 2.
   - `j` is 1.
   - If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, `cnt` is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, `cnt` remains either 0 or 1, and `i` is set to 2.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `j` is currently 1, the loop will continue if `j < n`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 (assuming `j` starts from 0).
   - Therefore, `j` will become 2.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is the upper limit of the range.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `j` will be 2.
   - `n` remains the same.

6. **Other States Remain Unchanged**:
   - `cnt` remains either 0 or 1.
   - `t` remains greater than 0.
   - `a` remains the same list of integers.
   - `b` remains the same list of integers.
   - `i` remains either 1 or 2.
   - `n` remains greater than 0.

Therefore, the adjusted states for the start of the next iteration are:

State: **`cnt` is either 0 or 1, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is 2**.
