Postcondition: `cnt` is either 0 or 1, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `b` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `i` is either 1 or 2, `j` is 1. If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, `cnt` is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, `cnt` remains either 0 or 1, and `i` is set to 2.
