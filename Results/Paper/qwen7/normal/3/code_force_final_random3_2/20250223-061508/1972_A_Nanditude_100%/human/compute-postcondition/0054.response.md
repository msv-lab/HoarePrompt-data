Based on the initial state provided:

- `cnt` is the count of elements in `b` that are less than `a[0]` after the loop has executed all its iterations.
- `i` will be equal to `n` if all elements in `b` are greater than or equal to `a[0]`, otherwise it will be the index of the last element in `b` that is less than `a[0]`.
- `j` will be equal to `n-1`.
- `n` remains unchanged.

To determine what will be printed, let's break down the key points:

1. **`cnt`**: This is the count of elements in `b` that are less than `a[0]`. Since no specific values for `a` and `b` are provided, we cannot determine the exact number, but we know it is the count of such elements.

2. **`i`**: If all elements in `b` are greater than or equal to `a[0]`, then `i` will be equal to `n`. Otherwise, `i` will be the index of the last element in `b` that is less than `a[0]`.

3. **`j`**: This is simply `n-1`, so it does not affect the value of `cnt`.

Given these points, the only variable directly involved in the `print` statement is `cnt`, which represents the count of elements in `b` that are less than `a[0]`.

Output: **cnt (where cnt is the count of elements in b that are less than a[0])**
