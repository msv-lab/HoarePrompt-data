Output State: `cnt` is equal to `n` if for every `j` in the range of `n`, `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`. Otherwise, `cnt` is equal to the number of times `b[j]` was less than `a[i]`. `i` is equal to `n`, `j` is `-1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `t` is decreased by the number of iterations (`n`), `a` is a list of integers obtained from input, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input.

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, `cnt` will count how many times an element in list `b` was less than the current value of `i` (which ends up being `n` after the loop). The variable `j` will be `-1` because it starts from `n-1` and is decremented until it reaches `-1`. The variable `i` will be `n` after all iterations since it is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.
