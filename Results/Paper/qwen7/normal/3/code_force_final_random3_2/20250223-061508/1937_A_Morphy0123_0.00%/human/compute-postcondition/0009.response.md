Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `power < log2(n)`.
2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `power` is 2
   - `n_cases` must be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\)
   - `i` is 0
   - `n` must be greater than 2 and not equal to 1

3. **Determine which states need adjustment**:
   - The loop head contains the variables `power` and `n`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `power < log2(n)` must be true.

4. **Analyze the current values**:
   - `power` is currently 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 2 and not equal to 1, but no specific value is given for `n`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - To ensure the loop executes again, `power` must be less than `log2(n)`.
   - Since `power` is currently 2, `log2(n)` must be greater than 2.
   - This means `n` must be greater than \(2^2 = 4\).

6. **Final state**:
   - `power` remains 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 4.

Therefore, the final state for the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`power` is 2, `n` must be greater than 4**
