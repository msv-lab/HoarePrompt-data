You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

    #State: All cases have been processed, and the loop has executed exactly `n_cases` times. For each case, if the input `n` is 1, the output is 1. If `n` is greater than 32768, the output is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`. If `n` is between 16384 and 32768, the output is 16384. If `n` is between 8192 and 16383, the output is 8192. If `n` is between 4096 and 8191, the output is 4096. If `n` is between 2048 and 4095, the output is 2048. If `n` is between 1024 and 2047, the output is 1024. If `n` is between 512 and 1023, the output is 512. If `n` is between 256 and 511, the output is 256. If `n` is between 128 and 255, the output is 128. If `n` is between 64 and 127, the output is 64. If `n` is between 32 and 63, the output is 32. If `n` is between 16 and 31, the output is 16. If `n` is between 8 and 15, the output is 8. If `n` is between 4 and 7, the output is 4. If `n` is between 2 and 3, the output is 2. If `n` is 1, the output is 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer \( n \). For each \( n \), it determines and prints the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to \( n \). If \( n \) is 1, it simply prints 1. The function reads the number of test cases from the input first, then iterates through each case, performing the necessary calculations and printing the result.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n_cases`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.

2. **Handling Edge Case:**
   - If `n` is 1, the program directly prints 1. This is correct because with only one element, the position of 1 remains 1.

3. **Finding Largest Power of 2 Less Than or Equal to `n`:**
   - The program uses a loop to find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`.
   - It starts with `power = 1` and increments `power` until `power >= log2(n)`.
   - This logic is flawed because `log2(n)` might not be an integer, and the loop condition should check if `2^power <= n` rather than `power < log2(n)`.

4. **Adjusting Power:**
   - After finding the largest power, it checks if `power` equals `n`.
   - If `power == n`, it prints `2 ** power`. However, this is incorrect because the position of 1 does not depend on whether `power` equals `n` but rather on the largest divisor `d` of `k` during the swap operations.

5. **Correct Logic for Finding Position of 1:**
   - The key insight is that after performing all the swaps, the position of 1 will be the smallest number `k` such that `k` is a power of 2 and `k <= n`.
   - This is because the swap operation always moves the smallest number (which starts as 1) to the position corresponding to the largest divisor of `k`.

### Corrected Program

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            # Find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to n
            power = 0
            while 2 ** power <= n:
                power += 1
            print(2 ** (power - 1))
```

### Verification

- For `n = 1`, the output is correctly `1`.
- For `n = 4`, the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 4 is 2, so the output is `2 // 2 = 1`, which is `4` (the position of 1).
- For `n = 5`, the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 5 is 2, so the output is `2 // 2 = 1`, which is `4` (the position of 1).
- For `n = 120240229`, the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 120240229 is 67108864, so the output is `67108864 // 2 = 33554432`, which is `67108864` (the position of 1).

### Conclusion

The original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in finding the largest power of 2. The corrected program above is correct based on the problem description.
