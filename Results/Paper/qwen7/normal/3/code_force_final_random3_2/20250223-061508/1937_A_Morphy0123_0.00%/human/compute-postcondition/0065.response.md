Output State: **All cases have been processed, and the loop has executed exactly `n_cases` times. For each case, if the input `n` is 1, the output is 1. If `n` is greater than 32768, the output is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`. If `n` is between 16384 and 32768, the output is 16384. If `n` is between 8192 and 16383, the output is 8192. If `n` is between 4096 and 8191, the output is 4096. If `n` is between 2048 and 4095, the output is 2048. If `n` is between 1024 and 2047, the output is 1024. If `n` is between 512 and 1023, the output is 512. If `n` is between 256 and 511, the output is 256. If `n` is between 128 and 255, the output is 128. If `n` is between 64 and 127, the output is 64. If `n` is between 32 and 63, the output is 32. If `n` is between 16 and 31, the output is 16. If `n` is between 8 and 15, the output is 8. If `n` is between 4 and 7, the output is 4. If `n` is between 2 and 3, the output is 2. If `n` is 1, the output is 1.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the program will have printed the appropriate output for each of the `n_cases` inputs provided, following the logic described in the loop.
