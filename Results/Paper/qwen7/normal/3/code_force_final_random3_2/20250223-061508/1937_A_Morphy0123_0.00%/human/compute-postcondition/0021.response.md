Postcondition: `n_cases` must be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is either 1 or the number of iterations it took for `power` to reach 15, `n` must be an input integer. If `n` is 1, `i` is 1. Otherwise, `power` is 15, `i` is the number of iterations it took for `power` to reach 15, and `n` must be greater than \(2^{15} = 32768\), and `power` is either equal to or not equal to `n` depending on the condition in the if statement.
