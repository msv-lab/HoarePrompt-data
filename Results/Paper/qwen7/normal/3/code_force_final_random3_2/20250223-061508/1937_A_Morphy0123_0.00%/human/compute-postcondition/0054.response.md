Output State: The value of `power` will be greater than or equal to the number of iterations it took for `power` to reach a value such that `log2(n)` is less than or equal to `power`. Additionally, `n` must initially be greater than 2.

To break this down further:
- Since the loop continues as long as `power < log2(n)`, and `power` starts at 1 and increases by 1 each iteration, the loop will continue until `power` is no longer less than `log2(n)`.
- The number of iterations required for `power` to reach a point where `power >= log2(n)` depends on the initial value of `n`.
- Given that `n` is initially greater than 2, `log2(n)` will be greater than 1, meaning the loop will run at least once.
- After the loop completes, `power` will be the smallest integer such that `power >= log2(n)`, which is effectively the ceiling of `log2(n)`.
