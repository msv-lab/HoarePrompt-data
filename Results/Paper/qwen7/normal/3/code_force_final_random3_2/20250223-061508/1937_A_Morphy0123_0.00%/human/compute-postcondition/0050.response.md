Output State: **`power` is `power + 2`, `n` is greater than 2**

Explanation: The initial state was `power` is `power + 1`, `n` is greater than 2. After executing `power += 1`, the value of `power` is incremented by 1, making it `power + 2`. The condition for `n` remains unchanged as it was already specified that `n` is greater than 2.
