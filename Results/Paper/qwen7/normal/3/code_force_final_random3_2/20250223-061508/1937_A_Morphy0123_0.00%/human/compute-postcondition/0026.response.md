Output State: **`power` is 1, `n_cases` must be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 2 (if it was 1) or `i + 1` (if it was the number of iterations it took for `power` to reach 15), `n` is an input integer, and `power` is either equal to or not equal to `n` depending on the condition in the if statement.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `power`. This does not affect the values of `n_cases`, `i`, `n`, or the condition of `power` being equal to or not equal to `n`. Therefore, the only change is that `power` is now 1.
