Based on the initial state provided:

- `n_cases` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `i` is either `i + 1` (if it was 2) or `i + 2` (if it was the number of iterations it took for `power` to reach 15).
- `n` is the integer input by the user.
- `power` is either equal to `n` if `n` is 1, or `power` is 15 and `n` is greater than or equal to 16384.

The `print(1)` statement simply prints the integer 1.

Output: **1**
