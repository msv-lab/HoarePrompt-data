Output State: **`power` is `power + 3`, `log2(n)` must be greater than `power + 1`**

Explanation: The initial state had `power` being `power + 2` and `log2(n)` must be greater than `power`. After executing `power += 1`, the value of `power` increases by 1, making it `power + 3`. The condition for `log2(n)` remains the same, but now it must be greater than `power + 1` (which was originally just `power`).
