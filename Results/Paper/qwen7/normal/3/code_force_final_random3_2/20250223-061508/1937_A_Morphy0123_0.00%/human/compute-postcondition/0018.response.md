Output State: **`power` is 14, `n_cases` must be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is the number of iterations it took for `power` to reach 15, `n` must be greater than \(2^{15} = 32768\), and `power` is not equal to `n`**.

The value of `power` is decremented by 1, making it 14. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
