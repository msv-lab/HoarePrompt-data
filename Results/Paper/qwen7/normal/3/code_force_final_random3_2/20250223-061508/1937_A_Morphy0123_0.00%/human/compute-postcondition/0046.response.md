Output State: **`n_cases` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is either `i + 1` (if it was 2) or `i + 2` (if it was the number of iterations it took for `power` to reach 15), `n` is the integer input by the user, `power` is 1.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `power`. This does not affect the values of `n_cases`, `i`, or `n`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
