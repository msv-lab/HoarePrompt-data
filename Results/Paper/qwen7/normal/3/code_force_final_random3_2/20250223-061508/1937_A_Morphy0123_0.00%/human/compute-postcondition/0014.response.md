Output State: `power` is 15, `n_cases` must be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than \(2^{14}\) and not equal to 1.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `power` until it is no longer less than \(\log_2(n)\). Given that `power` starts at 1 and increases by 1 each iteration, it will keep increasing until it reaches or exceeds \(\log_2(n)\). From the provided information, we know that after 3 iterations, `power` is 4 and \(\log_2(n)\) must be greater than 3. This means \(n > 2^3 = 8\).

To find out how many iterations it takes for `power` to reach its final value, we need to determine when \(\log_2(n)\) becomes less than or equal to `power`. Since `power` increments by 1 each time, and it starts from 1, the loop will continue until `power` is just large enough to satisfy the condition \(\log_2(n) \leq \text{power}\).

Given that `power` is 4 after 3 iterations, and assuming `n` is significantly larger (since the upper bound for `n_cases` is \(10^4\)), `power` will continue to increase. The maximum possible value for `power` before it stops the loop would be 15, as \(\log_2(32768) \approx 15\) (since \(2^{15} = 32768\)), which is within the range for `n_cases`.

Therefore, after all iterations, `power` will be 15, and `n` must be greater than \(2^{15} = 32768\).
