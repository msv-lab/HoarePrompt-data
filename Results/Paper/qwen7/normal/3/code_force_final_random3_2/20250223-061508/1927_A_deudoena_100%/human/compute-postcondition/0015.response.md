Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' that must have at least one 'B', `j` is the second character in `s`, `c` is 2, `mi` is 2.**

Explanation: The variable `mi` is assigned the value of `c`, which is 2. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `mi` is now 2, while `s`, `j`, and `c` retain their original values.
