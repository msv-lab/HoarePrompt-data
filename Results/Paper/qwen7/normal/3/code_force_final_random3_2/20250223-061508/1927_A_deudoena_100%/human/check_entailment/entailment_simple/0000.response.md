Reasoning:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case, calling `func_1()` for each one.
2. In `func_1()`, the program reads `n` and the string `s` for each test case.
3. The program initializes `ma` and `mi` to 0.
4. It then finds the index of the first 'B' in the string `s` and stores it in `mi`.
5. Next, it reverses the string `s` and finds the index of the last 'B' in the reversed string, storing it in `ma`.
6. Finally, it calculates and returns `ma - mi + 2`.

However, there are several issues with the logic:
- The calculation `ma - mi + 2` does not correctly determine the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white.
- The approach of finding the first and last 'B' and adding 2 does not account for the correct minimum segment length needed to turn all cells white.

To find the correct minimum segment length, we should:
- Identify the longest sequence of consecutive 'W's (white cells).
- The minimum segment length required to turn all cells white would be the length of the strip minus the length of this longest sequence of 'W's plus 1.

Let's correct the function accordingly:

```python
def func_1():
    s = input()
    max_white_sequence = 0
    current_white_sequence = 0
    
    for j in s:
        if j == 'W':
            current_white_sequence += 1
            max_white_sequence = max(max_white_sequence, current_white_sequence)
        else:
            current_white_sequence = 0
    
    return len(s) - max_white_sequence + 1
```

With this corrected function, the program should now correctly determine the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white to turn all cells white.

# Your response:
Correctness: **False**

The provided function does not correctly determine the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white to turn all cells white. The logic in the original function is flawed and does not account for the correct minimum segment length needed.
