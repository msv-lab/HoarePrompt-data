Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' that must have at least one 'B', `j` is the second character in `s`, `c` is 2, `mi` is 1**

Explanation: 
- The variable `c` was previously 1, and the code `c += 1` increments `c` by 1, making `c` equal to 2.
- The variables `s`, `j`, and `mi` remain unchanged from their previous values.
