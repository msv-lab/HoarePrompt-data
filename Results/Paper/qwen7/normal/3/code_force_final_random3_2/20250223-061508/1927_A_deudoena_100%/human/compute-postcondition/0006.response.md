Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' that must have at least one 'B', `j` is the first character in `s`, `c` is 1.**

The code `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. Since `c` was initially not specified, it is assumed to be 0 (as it is common for uninitialized variables to start at 0). After executing `c += 1`, the value of `c` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
