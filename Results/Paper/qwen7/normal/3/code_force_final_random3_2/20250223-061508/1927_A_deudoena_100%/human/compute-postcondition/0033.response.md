Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop variable in the given code is `j`, which iterates over the reversed string `s[::-1]`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `d` is increased by 1.
   - `s` is a sequence of 'W' and 'B' characters with at least one 'B'.
   - `j` is the last 'B' in the reversed string `s[::-1]`.
   - `c` is the length of `s`.
   - `mi` is the index of the first 'B' in the original string `s`.
   - `ma` is the length of `s` - `d`.
   - We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are more characters to iterate over in `s[::-1]`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `j` is the last 'B' in the reversed string `s[::-1]`, the next character in the reversed string (if it exists) would be either 'W' or another 'B'.
   - `d` will be incremented by 1 again.
   - `j` will now be set to this next character.
   - `c` remains the same as it is the length of `s` and does not change within the loop.
   - `mi` remains the same as it is the index of the first 'B' in the original string `s` and does not change within the loop.
   - `ma` will be recalculated as `c - d`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `d` is increased by 1.
- `j` is the next character in the reversed string `s[::-1]` (which could be 'W' or 'B').
- `c` remains the same.
- `mi` remains the same.
- `ma` is updated to `c - d`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`d` is increased by 1, `j` is the next character in the reversed string `s[::-1]`, `c` is the length of `s`, `mi` is the index of the first 'B' in the original string `s`, `ma` is the length of `s` - `d`**
