Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' that must have at least one 'B'; `j` is the first character in `s` and its current value is 'B'; `c` is 1; `mi` is 1.**

Explanation: The line `mi = c` assigns the value of `c` (which is 1) to the variable `mi`. All other variables remain unchanged.
