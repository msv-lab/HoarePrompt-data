Output State: **`d` is increased by 2, `j` is the next character in the reversed string `s[::-1]`, `c` is the length of `s`, `mi` is the index of the first 'B' in the original string `s`, `ma` is the length of `s` - `d`.**

Explanation: The code `d += 1` increments the value of `d` by 1. Since `d` was initially increased by 1, it is now increased by 2. The values of `j`, `c`, `mi`, and `ma` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
