Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()` and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to find the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white to turn all cells white.
   - However, the implementation of `func_1` does not correctly solve the problem. Let's break down the logic:
     - `ma` and `mi` are initialized to 0.
     - `m` is read as the length of the strip.
     - `s` is read as the string representing the strip.
     - `c` and `d` are used to count the positions where 'B' (black) is encountered.
     - The first loop finds the index of the first 'B' from the start (`mi`).
     - The second loop finds the index of the last 'B' from the end (`ma`).
     - The function returns `ma - mi + 2`.

3. **Logic Analysis:**
   - The logic to find the first and last 'B' is correct.
   - However, the calculation `ma - mi + 2` is incorrect. The correct formula should be `ma - mi + 1` because the segment length is calculated as the difference between the indices plus one.
   - Additionally, the function does not handle cases where there are multiple segments of 'B' in the middle of the strip. It only considers the first and last 'B'.

### Correct Implementation:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the longest sequence of consecutive 'W' (white) cells and calculate the length of the segment that needs to be painted to cover any remaining 'B' cells. Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1():
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    max_white_length = 0
    current_white_length = 0
    
    for j in s:
        if j == 'W':
            current_white_length += 1
        else:
            max_white_length = max(max_white_length, current_white_length)
            current_white_length = 0
    
    max_white_length = max(max_white_length, current_white_length)
    
    # Calculate the minimum length to paint
    min_paint_length = m - max_white_length
    return min_paint_length + 1
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in calculating the segment length. The provided solution above fixes the issue and correctly computes the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white.

**Correctness: False**
