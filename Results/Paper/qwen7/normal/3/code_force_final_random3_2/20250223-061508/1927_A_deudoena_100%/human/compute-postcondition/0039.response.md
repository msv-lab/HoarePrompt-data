Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `j` and `s`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each character in the reversed string `s[::-1]`. The variable `j` takes on the value of each character in this reversed string.

3. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `d` is increased by 2.
   - `j` is the next character in the reversed string `s[::-1]`.
   - `c` is the length of `s`.
   - `mi` is the index of the first 'B' in the original string `s`.
   - `ma` is equal to `len(s) - d`.

4. **Determine the next state**:
   - Since `j` is the next character in the reversed string `s[::-1]`, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be the character following the current `j`.
   - The other variables (`d`, `c`, `mi`, `ma`) remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body, but since no modifications are mentioned, they stay the same.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - `d` remains the same as it was increased by 2 in the previous iteration.
   - `j` changes to the next character in the reversed string `s[::-1]`.
   - `c` remains the same as it is the length of `s` and does not change.
   - `mi` remains the same as it is the index of the first 'B' in the original string `s` and does not change.
   - `ma` remains the same as it is `len(s) - d` and does not change.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`d` is increased by 2, `j` is the next character in the reversed string `s[::-1]`, `c` is the length of `s`, `mi` is the index of the first 'B' in the original string `s`, `ma` is equal to `len(s) - d`**.
