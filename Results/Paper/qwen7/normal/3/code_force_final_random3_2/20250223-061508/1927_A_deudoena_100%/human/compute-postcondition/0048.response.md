Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a string `s` of length `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10) consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', and an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). It returns the difference between the index of the last 'B' in the reversed string and the index of the first 'B' in the original string, plus 2.**
