Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for j in s:`. This means the variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `s`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the next iteration**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the string `s`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is the first character in `s` and its value is 'B', and `c` is 1, `mi` is 1.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `j` is the first character in `s` and it is 'B', for the loop to continue, `s` must still contain at least one more character. Therefore, `s` should be a string of length `n-1` (since one character has already been processed).
   - `j` will now be the second character in the updated string `s`.

4. **Update the states**:
   - `s` must be a string of length `n-1` (since one character has been processed).
   - `j` will be the second character in this new string `s`.
   - `c` and `mi` remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `s` is a string of length `n-1` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B' that must have at least one 'B', `j` is the second character in `s`, `c` is 1, `mi` is 1**.
