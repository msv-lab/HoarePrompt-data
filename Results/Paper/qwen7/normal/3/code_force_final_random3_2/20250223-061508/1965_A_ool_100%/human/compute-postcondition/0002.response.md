Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile, `set_` is a list of unique integers from `arr` sorted in ascending order, `A` is False.**

Explanation: The code `set_.sort()` sorts the list `set_` in ascending order. The initial state of `arr` and `A` remains unchanged. The list `set_` which contains unique integers from `arr` is now sorted.
