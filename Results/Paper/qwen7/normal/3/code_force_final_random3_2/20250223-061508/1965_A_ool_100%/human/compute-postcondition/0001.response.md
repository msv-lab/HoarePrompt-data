Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile, `set_` is a list of unique integers from `arr`, `A` is False.**

Explanation: The code `set_ = list(set(arr))` creates a set from the list `arr`, which removes any duplicate elements, and then converts it back into a list. This new list `set_` contains only the unique elements from the original list `arr`. The variable `A` remains unchanged and is still `False`.
