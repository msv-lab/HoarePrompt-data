Output State: **`i` is 1, `not_c` is False, and the difference between the first element of the set_ and the element at index i is greater than 1.**

Explanation: The line `not_c = False` simply assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `not_c`. It does not affect the values of `i` or the elements of `set_`. The precondition that `len(set_)` must be at least 1 and the difference between the first element of the set_ and the element at index `i` is greater than 1 remains unchanged.
