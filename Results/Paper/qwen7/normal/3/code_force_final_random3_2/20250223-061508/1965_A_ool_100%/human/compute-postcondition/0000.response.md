Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile, A is False.**

Explanation: The code snippet `A = False` simply assigns the boolean value `False` to the variable `A`. This does not affect the list `arr` or any other variables. Therefore, the list `arr` remains unchanged, and the only change is that `A` is now `False`.
