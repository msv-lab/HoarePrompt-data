Postcondition: `count` is 1, `k` is 0, `n` is greater than `j`, and the following conditions hold: the character at index `k` in string `s` is not `?`, the character at index `k + j` in string `s` is not `?`, and the character at index `k` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `k + j` in string `s`.
