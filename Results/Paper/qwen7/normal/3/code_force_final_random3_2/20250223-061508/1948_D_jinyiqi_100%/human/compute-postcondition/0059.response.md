Postcondition: `count` is either 2 or 0, `k` is 1, `n` is greater than `j`, and the character at index `k` in string `s` is not `?`, the character at index `k + j` in string `s` is not `?`, and the character at index `k` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `k + j` in string `s`. If `count` equals `j`, the function returns None. Otherwise, the function does not change the values of `count`, `k`, `n`, and `j`, and maintains the original conditions.
