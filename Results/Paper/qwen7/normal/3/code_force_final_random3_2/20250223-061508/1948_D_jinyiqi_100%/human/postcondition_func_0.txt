The function processes a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. It checks for sequences within the string where characters match or are question marks, up to a certain length defined by half the string's length. If such a sequence is found, it prints twice the length of the sequence and returns. If no such sequence exists, it prints `0`. The function does not return any value explicitly.
