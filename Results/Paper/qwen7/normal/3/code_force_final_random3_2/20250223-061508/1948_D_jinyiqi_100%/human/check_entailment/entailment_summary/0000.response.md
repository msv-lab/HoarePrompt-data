Reasoning:
- The provided program attempts to find the maximum length of a tandem repeat substring by replacing each question mark with a lowercase Latin letter.
- The function `func_1()` iterates through possible lengths of tandem repeats, starting from half the length of the string down to 1. For each possible length, it checks if the corresponding characters in the string match or are question marks.
- If a valid tandem repeat of a certain length is found, the function correctly prints twice the length of that tandem repeat and returns, which aligns with the problem requirements.
- The function handles all cases where no tandem repeat can be formed by printing `0`.
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
- However, there is a logical flaw in the implementation. The function `func_1()` does not actually replace the question marks with any specific characters; it just checks for the possibility of forming a tandem repeat with the existing characters and question marks. This means that the function might not always find the optimal solution because it does not attempt to maximize the length of the tandem repeat by trying different character replacements for the question marks.

Given this analysis, the function does not fully solve the problem as stated. It only checks if a tandem repeat exists without attempting to maximize the length by replacing question marks optimally.

Correctness: **False**
