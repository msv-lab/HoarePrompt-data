Output State: **`count` is 2, `k` is 1, `n` is greater than `j`, and the character at index `k` in string `s` is not `?`, the character at index `k + j` in string `s` is not `?`, and the character at `k` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `k + j` in string `s`.**

Explanation: The code increments the value of `count` by 1. Initially, `count` was 1. After executing `count += 1`, `count` becomes 2. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
