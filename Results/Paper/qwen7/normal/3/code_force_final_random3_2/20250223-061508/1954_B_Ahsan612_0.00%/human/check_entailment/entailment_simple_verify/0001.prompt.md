You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The array a is guaranteed to be beautiful, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5.

                num = ar[i]

        if minn == inf:

        else:
            print(minn)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `minn` will hold the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the entire list `ar`. `same` will be 1 because the loop has finished, meaning no new consecutive sequence is being counted. `num` will be the last element of the list `ar` that was processed. `i` will be equal to `len(ar)`. `t` will be an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` will be the last input integer, and `minn` will be the smallest value among all the counts of consecutive occurrences of any number in all lists `ar` across all test cases.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array can be made uniform by repeatedly replacing an element `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.

2. **Key Observation**: For an array to be beautiful, there must be at least one pair of adjacent elements that are equal and can be used to perform the operation. The goal is to find the smallest segment where this condition holds true and calculate the minimum removals needed to break this segment.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The provided code attempts to find the smallest segment of consecutive identical elements in the array.
   - It initializes `same` to count the length of the current segment of identical elements and `minn` to track the minimum segment length found.
   - The loop iterates through the array, updating `same` and `minn` as necessary.
   - After processing the array, it prints `-1` if no segment was found (indicating the array is already non-beautiful) or the length of the smallest segment otherwise.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where the entire array is uniform correctly by setting `minn` to infinity initially and checking if `minn` remains infinity after processing.
   - However, the logic to ensure the array is beautiful (as per the problem statement) is flawed. The code only checks for the presence of any segment of identical elements but does not ensure that the array is beautiful according to the given operation rules.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The code does not correctly identify whether the array is beautiful or not. It only checks for segments of identical elements without ensuring that these segments can be reduced to make the array non-beautiful.
   - The logic to determine the minimum number of removals needed to break the smallest segment is also flawed because it does not account for the specific operation rules.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.

### Correctness:
**False**
