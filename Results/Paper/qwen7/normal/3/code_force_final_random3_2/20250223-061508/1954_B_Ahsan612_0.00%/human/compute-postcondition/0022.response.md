Output State: **`minn` is 1, `same` is 1, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `num` is `ar[4]`, `i` is 4.**

Explanation: The line `minn = min(minn, same)` updates `minn` to be the minimum of its current value (which is the minimum of infinity and 1, thus 1) and `same` (which is 1). Since both values are 1, `minn` remains 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
