Output State: **`same` is 2, `num` is `ar[0]`, `i` is 3, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `minn` is infinity, `ar` is a list of integers, and the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code `i += 1` increments the value of `i` by 1. Initially, `i` was 2, so after executing the code, `i` becomes 3. The values of `same`, `num`, `t`, `n`, `minn`, and the list `ar` remain unchanged. Since the condition `ar[i] == num` was true initially (as stated in the initial state), the values of `same`, `num`, and the list `ar` remain as they were.
