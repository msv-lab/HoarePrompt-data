Output State: `minn` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `same` is 1, `num` is the last element of the list `ar` that was processed, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, and `minn` remains the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list `ar`.

Explanation: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to the length of the list `ar` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches the end of the list. The variable `minn` keeps track of the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list. Since the loop updates `minn` whenever it finds a new minimum, `minn` will be the smallest value of `same` encountered during the loop's execution. The value of `same` resets to 1 every time a different number is encountered, and it counts the consecutive occurrences of the current number (`num`). Finally, `num` will be the last number in the list that had consecutive occurrences counted, but since `same` is reset to 1 after counting those occurrences, `num` does not affect the final value of `minn`.
