Postcondition: `same` is either 1 or 2, `num` is either `ar[0]` if `same` is 2, or `ar[i]` if `same` is 1, `i` is either 2 or 3, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `minn` is 1, and `ar[i]` is equal to `num` if `same` is 2, otherwise `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`.
