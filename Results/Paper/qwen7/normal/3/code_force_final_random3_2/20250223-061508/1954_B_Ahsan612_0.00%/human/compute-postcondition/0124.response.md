Output State: `same` is the total number of consecutive occurrences of any integer in the list `ar`, `num` is the last integer that had consecutive occurrences, `i` is the index just after the last element of the list `ar`, `minn` is the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any integer in the list `ar`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, and `ar` is a list of integers.

Explanation: After the loop completes all its iterations, `same` will hold the length of the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements in the list `ar`. `num` will be the element that has the longest sequence of consecutive occurrences. The variable `i` will point to the first element beyond the end of the list `ar`. `minn` will store the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any integer in the list. All other variables (`t` and `n`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
