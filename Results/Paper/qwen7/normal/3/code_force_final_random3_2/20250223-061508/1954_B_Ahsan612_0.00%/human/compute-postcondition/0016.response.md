Postcondition: **`minn` is the minimum of `minn` (initially infinity) and `same` (which is 1), `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `same` is 1, `num` is the first element of the list `ar`, `i` is 1 if `ar[i]` equals `num`, otherwise `i` is 2, and `same` remains 1.**
