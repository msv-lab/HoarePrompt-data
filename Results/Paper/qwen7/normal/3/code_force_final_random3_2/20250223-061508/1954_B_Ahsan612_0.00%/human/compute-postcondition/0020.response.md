Output State: **`minn` is the minimum of `minn` (initially infinity) and `same` (which is 1); `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `n` is an input integer; `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer; `same` is 1; `num` is the first element of the list `ar`; `i` is 4.**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
