Output State: **`same` is 1, `num` is `ar[0]`, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code snippet assigns the first element of the list `ar` to the variable `num`. The other variables (`same`, `i`, `t`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
