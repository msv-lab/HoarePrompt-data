Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the array has alternating elements, such as `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`. In this case, the program incorrectly calculates the minimum number of elements to remove.

Let's analyze the given example:

Input:
```
5
1 2 1 2 1
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

However, the program outputs `-1`, which is incorrect. Here's why:

- The program initializes `same` to 1 and sets `num` to `ar[0]`.
- It iterates through the array and checks if the current element is equal to `num`.
- If they are equal, it increments `same`.
- If they are not equal, it updates `num` to the current element and resets `same` to 1.
- Finally, it finds the minimum value of `same` and prints `-1` if `minn` remains infinity.

In the example `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program will set `num` to `1` initially, then update it to `2` after encountering the second element. It will then reset `same` to 1 and continue iterating. However, since the array alternates between `1` and `2`, `same` will never be greater than 1, and `minn` will remain infinity. Therefore, the program incorrectly prints `-1`.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly identify the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements and calculate the minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty condition.
