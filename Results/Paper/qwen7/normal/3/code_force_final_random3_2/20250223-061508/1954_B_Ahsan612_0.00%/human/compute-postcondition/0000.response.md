Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved in this loop head are:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used to iterate over the range produced by `range(int(input()))`.
   - `input()`: This function call is used to get input from the user.

2. **Understand the Input and Loop Execution**: The loop will execute once for each line of input provided by the user. The number of lines of input is determined by `int(input())`.

3. **Adjust the States**: Since the loop will execute based on the input provided, we need to ensure that the input is valid and that the loop can proceed. Specifically, we need to ensure that the input value is within the expected range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value itself, ensuring it falls within the specified range.

**State:**
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

Therefore, the final answer is:
**State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**.
