Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful.
2. A beautiful array can be modified by replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).
3. The provided solution iterates through the array to find the minimum length of consecutive sequences of the same number.
4. If there are multiple sequences of the same number, the minimum length of these sequences is stored in `minn`.
5. If `minn` remains infinity after processing all sequences, it means the array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements, hence the output is `-1`.
6. Otherwise, `minn` gives the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break the beauty of the array.

However, there are a few issues with the logic:
- The code does not correctly handle the condition to make the array non-beautiful. It only finds the minimum length of consecutive sequences but does not ensure that removing these elements will break the beauty of the array.
- The code should focus on finding the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements and then calculate the minimum number of removals needed to break this sequence.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the logic:
- Find the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements.
- If the length of this sequence is greater than 1, the minimum number of elements to remove is the length of this sequence minus 1.
- If the length is 1, the array is already non-beautiful, so no removals are needed.
- If no such sequence exists, the array is already non-beautiful, and the output should be `-1`.

Given the above points, the original code does not fully address the problem requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
