Output State: **`same` is between 1 and `len(ar)`, `num` is the last element that was equal to `ar[i-1]` before the loop ended, `i` is `len(ar)`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `minn` is the minimum value of `same` encountered during the loop, `ar` is a list of integers entered by the user, and we take input for the list `ar`.**

Explanation: The code `ar = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user and converts them into a list of integers. This changes the value of `ar` to a list of integers, but does not affect the values of `same`, `num`, `i`, `t`, `n`, or `minn`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions, and the new state includes the updated list `ar`.
