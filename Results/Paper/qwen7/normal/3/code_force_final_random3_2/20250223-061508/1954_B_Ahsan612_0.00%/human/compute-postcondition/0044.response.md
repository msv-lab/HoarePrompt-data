Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop is defined as `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable used in the loop head is `_`, which is a placeholder and does not hold any specific value. The actual variables that might change within the loop are `minn`, `same`, `num`, `i`, `t`, and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial States:**
   - `minn` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list `ar`.
   - `same` is updated to be 1 if a different number is encountered or remains the same if the same number continues consecutively.
   - `num` is the last element of the list `ar` that was processed.
   - `i` is equal to `len(ar)`.
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.

3. **Adjust the States for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `int(input())` must evaluate to a positive integer.
   - Since `_` is a placeholder, it doesn't affect the loop condition directly. However, the loop will continue as long as the input is a positive integer.
   - Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the input itself, which is represented by `int(input())`.

Given that the loop will execute again if the input is a positive integer, we need to ensure that the input is valid for the next iteration.

**State:**
- `minn` remains the same.
- `same` remains the same.
- `num` remains the same.
- `i` remains the same.
- `t` remains the same.
- `n` remains the same.
- The input for the next iteration must be a positive integer.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`minn` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list `ar`, `same` is updated to be 1 if a different number is encountered or remains the same if the same number continues consecutively, `num` is the last element of the list `ar` that was processed, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, and the input for the next iteration must be a positive integer.**
