Output State: **`same` is either 3 or 1, `num` is either `ar[0]` when `same` is 3 or `ar[i]` when `same` is 1, `i` is either 6 or 7, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `minn` is 2, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 6**.

Explanation: The variable `i` is incremented by 1, changing its value from either 5 or 6 to either 6 or 7. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
