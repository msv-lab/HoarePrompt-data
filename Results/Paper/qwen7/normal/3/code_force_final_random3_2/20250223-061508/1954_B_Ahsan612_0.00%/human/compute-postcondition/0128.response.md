Based on the initial state provided:

- `same` is the total number of consecutive occurrences of the most frequent element in the list `ar`.
- `num` is the last element that had the highest count of consecutive occurrences.
- `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, which means `i` is the length of the list `ar`.
- `minn` is the minimum value of `same` encountered during the loop's execution.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `minn` is updated to be the minimum value between the current `minn` and `same`.
- `minn` equals infinity initially.

The print statement is `print(-1)`, which directly prints the integer `-1`.

Output: **-1**
