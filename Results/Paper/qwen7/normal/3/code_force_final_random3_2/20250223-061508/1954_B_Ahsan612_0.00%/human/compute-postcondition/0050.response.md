Output State: **`same` is 1, `num` is `ar[0]`, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `minn` is infinity**.

The value of `i` is explicitly set to 1, which updates its value from its previous state of being equal to `len(ar)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
