Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` implicitly through the test cases. It verifies that the array `a` is beautiful, meaning every element appears exactly once, and returns True if the conditions are met. If any condition is violated, it returns False.**

This functionality describes a function that implicitly receives `n` (the size of the array) and `a` (the array of integers), checks if the array is beautiful (each element from 1 to n appears exactly once), and returns True if valid, otherwise returns False.
