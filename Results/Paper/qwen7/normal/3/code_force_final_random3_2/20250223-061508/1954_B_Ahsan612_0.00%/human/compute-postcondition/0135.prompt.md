Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The array a is guaranteed to be beautiful, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
    same = 1
    num = ar[0]
    minn = inf
    i = 1
    while i < len(ar):
        if ar[i] == num:
            same += 1
        else:
            i += 1
            num = ar[i]
            minn = min(minn, same)
            same = 1
        i += 1
    minn = min(minn, same)
    if minn == inf:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(minn)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `minn` is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list `ar`. `same` is updated to be 1 if a different number is encountered or remains the same if the same number continues consecutively. `num` is the last element of the list `ar` that was processed. `i` is equal to `len(ar)`. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, and `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: Postcondition: `same` is between 1 and `len(ar)`, `num` is the last element that was equal to `ar[i-1]` before the loop ended, `i` is `len(ar)`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, and `minn` is the minimum value of `same` encountered during the loop, which is either equal to infinity (if it was not updated within the loop) or a finite value (if it was updated).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Postcondition: `same` is the total number of consecutive occurrences of the most frequent element in the list `ar`, `num` is the last element that had the highest count of consecutive occurrences, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `minn` is the minimum value of `same` encountered during the loop's execution, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, and `minn` is updated to be the minimum value between the current `minn` and `same`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
