Output State: **`same` is either 3 or 1, `num` is `ar[i]`, `i` is increased by 1, `minn` is the minimum of `minn` and 2, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers, and the current value of `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.**

Explanation: The code `num = ar[i]` simply assigns the value of `ar[i]` to `num`. This does not change the value of `same`, `minn`, `t`, `n`, or the list `ar`. The variable `i` is also increased by 1, but its new value is not specified, so we keep it as "increased by 1". The precondition remains valid, and the updated value of `num` is now `ar[i]`.
