Postcondition: `same` is between 1 and `len(ar)`, `num` is the last element that was equal to `ar[i-1]` before the loop ended, `i` is `len(ar)`, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `minn` is the minimum value of `same` encountered during the loop, and `minn` is not equal to infinity.
