Postcondition: `minn` is the minimum value between its current value (1) and `same`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `same` is updated to be 1 if a different number is encountered or remains the same if the same number continues consecutively, `num` is the last element of the list `ar` that was processed, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, and `minn` is updated to be the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list `ar`.
