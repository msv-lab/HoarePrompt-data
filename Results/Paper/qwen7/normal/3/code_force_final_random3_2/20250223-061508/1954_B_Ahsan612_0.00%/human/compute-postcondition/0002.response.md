Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `ar = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a single line of input, splits it into a list of strings using whitespace as the delimiter, and then converts each string in the list to an integer. The resulting list of integers is assigned to the variable `ar`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
