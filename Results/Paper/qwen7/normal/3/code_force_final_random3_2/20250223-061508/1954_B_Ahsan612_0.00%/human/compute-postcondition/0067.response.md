Output State: **`same` is 2, `minn` is 2, `num` is `ar[i]`, `i` is 5, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The line `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum between its current value (`infinity`) and the value of `same` (which is 2). Therefore, `minn` becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
