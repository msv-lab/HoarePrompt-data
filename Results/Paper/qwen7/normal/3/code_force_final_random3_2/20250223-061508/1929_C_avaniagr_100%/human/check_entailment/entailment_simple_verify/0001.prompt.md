You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

    #State: Output State: The loop processes each line of input until there are no more lines to process. For each line, the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` are read and used to determine whether to print 'YES' or 'NO'. If `x < k - 1` and `a >= x + 1`, it prints 'YES' and checks if `a` remains greater than or equal to `x + 1`. If `x == k - 1` and `a >= x + 2`, it prints 'YES' and does not change `a`. If `x > k - 1`, it calculates `z` as described in the loop and checks if `a >= z` before printing 'YES' or 'NO'. After processing all lines, the final state of `[*open(0)]` will be a list containing the remaining lines of input that were not processed, and the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` will reflect the last set of values read from the input.
    #
    #In summary, the output state after the loop executes all iterations will be a list `[*open(0)]` containing any remaining unprocessed lines of input, and the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` will be the last values read from the input.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads input from standard input using `[*open(0)][1:]`, which means it reads all lines except the first one. This is fine for the given problem where the first line specifies the number of test cases.

2. **Variable Extraction**:
   - For each test case, it extracts `k`, `x`, and `a` from the input string using `map(int, s.split())`. This is correct as per the problem statement.

3. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks different conditions based on the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.

4. **Case 1: \( x < k - 1 \)**:
   - If `x < k - 1`, it checks if `a >= x + 1`. If true, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.
     - **Reasoning**: 
       - If `x < k - 1`, Sasha can afford to lose up to `x` times in a row because he can always bet 1 coin after a loss without exceeding his current coins. After `x` losses, he will have at least `x + 1` coins, allowing him to continue betting and eventually accumulate more coins.
     - **Correctness**: This logic is correct.

5. **Case 2: \( x == k - 1 \)**:
   - If `x == k - 1`, it checks if `a >= x + 2`.
     - **Reasoning**:
       - If `x == k - 1`, Sasha can afford to lose up to `x` times in a row. After `x` losses, he will have at least `x + 2` coins, allowing him to continue betting and eventually accumulate more coins.
     - **Correctness**: This logic is correct.

6. **Case 3: \( x > k - 1 \)**:
   - If `x > k - 1`, it calculates `z` as `k - 2` and iterates over a range `x - k + 3` to update `z`.
     - **Reasoning**:
       - If `x > k - 1`, Sasha needs a more complex strategy to ensure he can recover from potential losses. The calculation of `z` seems to be an attempt to find a minimum number of coins required to ensure he can recover from `x` consecutive losses.
     - **Correctness**:
       - The logic here is more complex. Let's verify the formula:
         - The formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` is used to calculate the minimum number of coins needed to ensure recovery from `x` consecutive losses.
         - This formula ensures that even if Sasha loses `x` times in a row, he can still recover and continue betting.
     - **Verification**:
       - The formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` is correct for ensuring Sasha can recover from `x` consecutive losses. It effectively calculates the minimum number of coins needed to cover the worst-case scenario of losing `x` times in a row.

7. **Final Check**:
   - If `a >= z`, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.
     - **Reasoning**:
       - This final check ensures that Sasha has enough initial coins to start the strategy and recover from potential losses.
     - **Correctness**: This logic is correct.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, we can confirm that it correctly implements the logic to determine if Sasha can achieve his goal of obtaining any number of coins.

**Correctness: True**
