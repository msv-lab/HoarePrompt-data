Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if Sasha can achieve any number of coins \( n \) given the constraints on \( k \), \( x \), and \( a \).
2. The provided code reads multiple lines of input, each containing three integers \( k \), \( x \), and \( a \), and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on these values.
3. The logic in the code checks different conditions to determine if Sasha can guarantee winning enough coins:
   - If \( x < k - 1 \): Sasha can win at least \( x + 1 \) times in a row, which means he can always get more coins.
   - If \( x == k - 1 \): Sasha needs at least \( x + 2 \) coins to ensure he can cover the bets without running out.
   - For other cases, it calculates a threshold \( z \) using a loop and checks if \( a \) is greater than or equal to \( z \).

4. The code correctly handles the conditions specified in the problem statement:
   - It correctly identifies when Sasha can win any number of coins.
   - It correctly identifies when Sasha cannot win any number of coins.
   - The calculations and comparisons are performed accurately based on the given constraints.

Given the execution summary and the detailed analysis, the provided code appears to be correct according to the problem description and the conditions provided.

Correctness: **True**
