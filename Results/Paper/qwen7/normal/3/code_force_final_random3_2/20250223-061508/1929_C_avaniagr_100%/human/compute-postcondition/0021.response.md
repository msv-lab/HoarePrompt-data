Output: **NO**

Explanation: The `print('NO')` statement directly prints the string 'NO'. The values of `k`, `x`, and `a` are derived from splitting a string `s`, but these specific values are not required to determine the output of the print statement. The print statement itself does not depend on the values of `k`, `x`, or `a` to execute. Therefore, it simply outputs the string 'NO'.
