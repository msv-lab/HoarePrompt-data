Based on the initial state provided:

- `[*open(0)]` is a list with at least 2 elements.
- `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers assigned from splitting the string `s`.
- The current value of `x` is less than `k - 1`.
- The current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`.

The print statement is simply:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement will print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`. Therefore, the output is:

Output: **YES**
