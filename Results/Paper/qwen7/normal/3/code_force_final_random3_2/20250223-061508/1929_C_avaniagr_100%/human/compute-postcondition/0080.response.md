Postcondition: `[*open(0)]` is a list with at least 2 elements, `k` is the first integer from the third element of `[*open(0)]` split by spaces, `x` is the second integer from the third element of `[*open(0)]` split by spaces, `a` is the third integer from the third element of `[*open(0)]` split by spaces, and `s` is the third element of `[*open(0)]`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`, no changes are made to the list. Otherwise, no changes are made to the list either.
