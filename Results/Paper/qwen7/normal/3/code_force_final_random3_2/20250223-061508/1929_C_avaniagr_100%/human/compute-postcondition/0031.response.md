Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables are `i` and `x - k + 3`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to continue**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < x - k + 3`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i_prev + 1`.
   - `x - k + 3` remains unchanged.

3. **Update the state**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration (`i = i_prev + 1`), at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 2`.
   - `x - k + 3` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `z` is updated to `z + z // (k - 1) + 1`, but this variable is not part of the loop head and does not need to be adjusted for the loop to continue.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is `i_prev + 2`, `x - k + 3` remains unchanged**
