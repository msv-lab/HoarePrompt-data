Output State: **`i` is `i_prev + 1`, `x - k + 3` remains unchanged, `z` is `z + z // (k - 1) + 1`**

Explanation: The variable `z` is updated by adding the integer division of `z` by `(k - 1)` plus 1 to its current value. The other variables (`i` and `x - k + 3`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
