Postcondition: `[*open(0)]` is a list with at least 2 elements, `k` is an integer from the split string, `x` is an integer from the split string, `a` is an integer from the split string. Since both the if and else parts do not change the values of the variables `[*open(0)]`, `k`, `x`, and `a`, the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition.
