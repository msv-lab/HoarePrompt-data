Output State: **`heap[0]` is now `smallest + 1`, `smallest` is the value that was at the root of the heap (`heap[0]`) before it was removed, `operations` is increased by 1.**

The variable `operations` is incremented by 1, while the other variables retain their previous values. The value of `heap[0]` is updated to `smallest + 1`, and `smallest` remains the value that was originally at the root of the heap before it was removed.
