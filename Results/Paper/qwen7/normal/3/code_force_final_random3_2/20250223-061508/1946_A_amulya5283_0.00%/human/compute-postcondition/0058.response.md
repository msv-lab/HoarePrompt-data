Output State: **`heap[0]` is now greater than `current_median`; `smallest` is the value that was at the root of the heap (`heap[0]` before popping); `heap` has a new element which is `smallest + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)` pushes the value `smallest + 1` into the heap. Since `smallest` was the root of the heap before popping, the heap property might be violated, but the push operation ensures that the new value is added to the heap. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
