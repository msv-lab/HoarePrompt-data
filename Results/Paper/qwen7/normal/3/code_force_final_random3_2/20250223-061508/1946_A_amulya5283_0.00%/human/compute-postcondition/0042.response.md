Output State: **`heap` contains the smallest element plus one, and `smallest` is now the value that was at the root of the heap before `heapq.heappop(heap)` was called.**

Explanation: The code pushes the value of `smallest + 1` back into the heap using `heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)`. This means the smallest element in the heap (which was `smallest` before calling `heapq.heappop(heap)`) has been replaced with `smallest + 1`. The variable `smallest` retains its original value from before the `heapq.heappop(heap)` call.
