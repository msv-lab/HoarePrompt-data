The loop condition is `heap[0] <= current_median`. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition must be true at the start of the next iteration. 

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `heap[0]` is now greater than `current_median`.
- `smallest` is the value that was at the root of the heap (`heap[0]` before popping).
- `heap` has a new element which is `smallest + 1`.
- `operations` is incremented by 1.

To satisfy the loop condition `heap[0] <= current_median` again, we need to ensure that `heap[0]` becomes less than or equal to `current_median`. The only way to change this is by adjusting the value of `heap[0]`.

Given that `heap[0]` was previously greater than `current_median`, and now `heap[0]` is the smallest value plus one, the only way to make `heap[0]` less than or equal to `current_median` is to perform an operation that decreases `heap[0]` or increases `current_median`. However, since the problem does not provide any direct way to change `current_median`, we can only adjust `heap[0]`.

Therefore, we need to adjust `heap[0]` to be less than or equal to `current_median`.

State: **`heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median`**
