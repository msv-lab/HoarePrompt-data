Output State: **`operations` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[1]`, `arr` is now sorted, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a slice of `arr` starting from index `median_index` to the end excluding the smallest element, `smallest` is the smallest element popped from `heap`, `heap` is updated to include `smallest + 1` as the smallest element plus one.**

Explanation: The code pushes the value of `smallest + 1` into the heap using `heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)`. Since `smallest` was previously the smallest element in the heap, after adding `smallest + 1`, the heap is updated to include this new value. All other variables remain unchanged.
