The code `current_median = arr[median_index]` simply reassigns the value of `current_median` to be the same as `arr[median_index]`. Since `median_index` is `n // 2`, and `n` is the first element of `test_cases[1]`, `current_median` is already set to `arr[n // 2]`. This assignment does not change the value of `current_median`, so it remains the same.

The output state remains unchanged from the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is:

**`operations` is 3, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[1]`, `arr` is sorted, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a slice of `arr` starting from index `median_index` to the end, `heap[0]` is the original smallest element plus 3, `smallest` is the original smallest element plus 2, `heap` has been updated to include `smallest + 1` three times, `results` is [3, `n`, `arr[0]`], `median_index` is `n // 2`.**
