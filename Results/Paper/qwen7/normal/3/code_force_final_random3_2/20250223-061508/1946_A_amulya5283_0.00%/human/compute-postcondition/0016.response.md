Output State: **`operations` is 2, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[i]`, `arr` is a sorted version of the second element of `test_cases[i]`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heap data structure starting from `arr[median_index]` to the end of `arr`, `heap[0]` is now the smallest element popped from the heap, `smallest` is the smallest element popped from the heap, `heap` now contains the smallest element (previously `heap[0]`) with a new value of `smallest + 1`, `smallest + 1` is less than or equal to `current_median`, `smallest` is the previous smallest element popped from the heap.**

Explanation: The line `operations += 1` increments the value of `operations` by 1. Since `operations` was initially 1, it is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged as the code does not affect their values.
