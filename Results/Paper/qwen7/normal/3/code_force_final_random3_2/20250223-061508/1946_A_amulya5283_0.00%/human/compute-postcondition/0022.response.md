Output State: `operations` is 3, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[i]`, `arr` is a sorted version of the second element of `test_cases[i]`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heap data structure starting from `arr[median_index]` to the end of `arr` with the smallest element being `smallest + 1`, `smallest` is the previous smallest element popped from the heap, `smallest` is decreased by 1, and `heap` now contains `smallest + 1`.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as the smallest element in the heap (`heap[0]`) is less than or equal to the current median (`current_median`). After each iteration, the smallest element in the heap is incremented by 1 and re-added to the heap. Since the loop has executed 3 times, the smallest element in the heap will have been incremented 3 times, resulting in `smallest + 3`. The `operations` counter will also be incremented by 3, making it 3. All other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
