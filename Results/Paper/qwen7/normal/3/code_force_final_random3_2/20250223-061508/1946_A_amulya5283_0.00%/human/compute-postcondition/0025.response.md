Output State: **`operations` is 3, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[1]`, `arr` is a sorted version of the second element of `test_cases[1]`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heap data structure starting from `arr[median_index]` to the end of `arr` with the smallest element being `smallest + 3`, `smallest` is decreased by 1, and `heap` now contains `smallest + 3`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `n` to the first element of `test_cases[1]` and assigns the second element of `test_cases[1]` to `arr`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `smallest` is decreased by 1, and the heap is adjusted accordingly.
