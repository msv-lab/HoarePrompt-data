Output State: **`operations` is 3, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[i]`, `arr` is a sorted version of the second element of `test_cases[i]`, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heap data structure starting from `arr[median_index]` to the end of `arr` with the smallest element being `smallest + 3`, `smallest` is decreased by 1, and `heap` now contains `smallest + 3`**.

Explanation: The loop has executed 3 times, incrementing the smallest element in the heap by 1 each time. Initially, the smallest element was `smallest + 1`, and after 3 increments, it becomes `smallest + 3`. The `operations` counter is incremented by 3, making it 3. All other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
