Output State: The loop continues to execute as long as the root of the heap (`heap[0]`) is less than or equal to `current_median`. After all iterations, the root of the heap (`heap[0]`) will be greater than `current_median`. The `smallest` variable will hold the value that was originally at the root of the heap when the loop started. Each time the loop runs, the smallest element is incremented by 1 and pushed back into the heap, and the `operations` counter is incremented. Therefore, after all iterations, the root of the heap will be the original smallest element plus the number of iterations, and `operations` will be equal to the total number of iterations performed.

Since the loop executes 3 times based on the given states, we can infer that it will continue to execute until the root of the heap exceeds `current_median`. Thus, after all iterations, the root of the heap will be the original smallest element plus the total number of iterations, and `operations` will be equal to the total number of iterations.

Assuming the loop terminates after the third iteration (as per the provided states), the final state would be:

- The root of the heap (`heap[0]`) is the original smallest element plus 3.
- `current_median` remains unchanged.
- `smallest` holds the original smallest element.
- `operations` is equal to the total number of iterations, which is 3.

Output State: `heap[0]` is the original smallest element plus 3; `current_median` remains unchanged; `smallest` holds the original smallest element; `operations` is 3.
