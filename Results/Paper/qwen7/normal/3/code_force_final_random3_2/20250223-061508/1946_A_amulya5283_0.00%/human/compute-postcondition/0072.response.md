Output State: `operations` is 3 for each iteration, `t` is the total number of test cases, `i` ranges from 0 to `t-1`, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[i]` for each iteration, `arr` is a sorted version of the second element of `test_cases[i]` for each iteration, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` remains unchanged as it is the value of `arr[median_index]` for each iteration, `heap` is a heap data structure starting from `arr[median_index]` to the end of `arr` for each iteration, `heap[0]` is the original smallest element plus 3 for each iteration, `smallest` holds the original smallest element for each iteration, `heap` has been updated to include `smallest + 1` three times for each iteration, and `results` is a list containing 3 for each iteration.

This means that for every test case, the loop performs exactly 3 operations, and the `results` list will contain 3 for each test case after all iterations of the loop have completed.
