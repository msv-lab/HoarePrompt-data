Output State: **`heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median`; `smallest` is the value that was at the root of the heap (`heap[0]`) before it was removed.**

Explanation: The code `smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)` removes the smallest element from the heap (which is guaranteed to be the root of the heap) and assigns it to the variable `smallest`. The condition that `heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median` remains unchanged because the heap property and the relationship between `heap[0]` and `current_median` are not directly affected by this operation.
