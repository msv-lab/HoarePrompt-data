Output State: `operations` is the sum of operations for each iteration, `t` is the total number of test cases, `i` ranges from 0 to `t-1`, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[i]` for each `i`, `arr` is a sorted version of the second element of `test_cases[i]` for each `i`, `median_index` is `n // 2` for each `i`, `current_median` remains the same as `arr[median_index]` for each `i`, `heap` is a heap data structure starting from `arr[median_index]` to the end of `arr` for each `i`, `heap[0]` is the original smallest element plus 3 for each `i`, `smallest` holds the original smallest element plus 2 for each `i`, `heap` has been updated to include `smallest + 1` three times for each `i`, `results` is a list containing the sum of `operations` for all iterations.

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, `operations` will be the total number of operations performed across all test cases, `results` will be a list containing the total operations for each test case, and all other variables will reflect their final states after processing all test cases according to the given logic.
