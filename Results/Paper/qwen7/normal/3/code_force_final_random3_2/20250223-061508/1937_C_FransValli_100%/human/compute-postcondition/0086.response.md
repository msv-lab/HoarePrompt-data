Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `res` is an input string, and the current value of `res` is equal to '<', `maxi` is 1**.

Explanation: The line `maxi = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 1) to the variable `maxi`. The values of `i`, `n`, `res`, and their conditions remain unchanged.
