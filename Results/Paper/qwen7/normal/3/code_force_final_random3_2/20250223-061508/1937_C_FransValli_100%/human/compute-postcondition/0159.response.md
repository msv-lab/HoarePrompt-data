Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - The loop starts with `i` initialized to 1 (since the range is `range(1, n)`).
   - The value of `n` is not directly given, but we know that `i` will iterate from 1 up to `n-1`.

3. **Check the Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute if `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 1, we need to ensure that `i` remains within the range defined by `n`.
   - The initial value of `i` is 1, so we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

5. **Final State Adjustment**:
   - `total` is not mentioned in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.
   - `mini` and `item` are set to `arr[n-1]`, but these values do not affect the loop condition.
   - `res` is an input string, which does not affect the loop condition.
   - `maxi` is 0, which also does not affect the loop condition.

Therefore, the only states that need to be adjusted are those related to `i` and `n`.

**State:**
**`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
