Output State: **The loop will continue to iterate until `i` reaches `n`. After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`, `n` will still be greater than or equal to 1, `res` will be the last input string received, and `maxi` will be the maximum value between 0 and any value assigned to it during the loop (which happens when `res` equals '<').**

In simpler terms, after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the input integer `n`. The variable `maxi` will hold the highest value between 0 and any value of `i` for which the user input was '<'. The variable `res` will contain the last input received from the user during the loop.
