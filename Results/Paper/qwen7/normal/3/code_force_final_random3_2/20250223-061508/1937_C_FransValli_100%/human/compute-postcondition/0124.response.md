Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. This means `i` starts at 1 and increments by 1 until it reaches `n`.

3. **Determine the state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `i` is `i + 1`
   - `n` remains the same
   - `res` is an input string (this does not change within the loop)
   - `arr` contains the value of `i + 1`

4. **Adjust the state for the next iteration**:
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `res` remains the same.
   - `arr` should now contain the value of the new `i + 1`.

Given these points, let's construct the new state:

- `i` is incremented by 1, so if the previous value of `i` was `i + 1`, the new value of `i` is `i + 2`.
- `n` remains the same.
- `res` remains the same.
- `arr` should now contain the value of `i + 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`i` is `i + 2`, `n` is the same, `res` is an input string, and `arr` contains the value of `i + 2`**.
