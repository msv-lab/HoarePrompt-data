Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `arr` is a list containing a single element, which is `0`.
   - `n` must be at least 1, but its exact value is not specified.
   - `maxi` is explicitly given as `0`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
   ```

   - `'?'`: This is a string literal and will be printed as is.
   - `maxi`: As per the initial state, `maxi` is `0`.
   - `arr[0]`: Since `arr` is `[0]`, `arr[0]` is `0`.
   - `maxi`: Again, `maxi` is `0`.
   - `i`: The variable `i` is not defined in the initial state. However, since it is used in the print statement without any assignment, it implies that `i` might be a variable that holds some value, but its specific value is not provided. For the purpose of this exercise, we will assume it is not defined or its value is irrelevant to the output as it is not provided.

Given the above breakdown, the print statement will output the string `'?'` followed by the values of `maxi` and `arr[0]`, repeated twice, with `i` being omitted due to lack of definition.

Output: **'? 0 0 0 None'** (Note: The `None` is a placeholder for the undefined `i` value, indicating it is not provided in the initial state.)
