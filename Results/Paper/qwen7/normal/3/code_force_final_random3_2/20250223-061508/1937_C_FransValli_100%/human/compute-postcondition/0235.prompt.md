Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: This is an interactive problem where you need to find two indices i and j such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized for a given permutation \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \) of \(\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}\). You can ask up to 3n queries of the form "? a b c d" to compare the results of bitwise OR operations on pairs of elements in the permutation. After finding the indices, you must print "! i j".
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    maxi = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '<':
            maxi = i
    arr = [0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '<':
            arr = [i]
        elif res == '=':
            arr.append(i)
    mini = arr[0]
    for item in arr[1:]:
        print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
        res = input()
        if res == '>':
            mini = item
    print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: arr is [i+2, i+1], mini is i+1, item is i+1, res is '>', n is at least i + 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `mini` is equal to `arr[n-1]`, `item` is `arr[n-1]`, and `res` is an input string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `mini` is equal to the last item in `arr[1:]`, `res` is an input string, `maxi` is equal to `n-1`, `i` is either `n` or `n+1`, `arr` is an empty list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
