Output State: **`res` is the new input string provided by the user, `maxi` is equal to `i + 1`, and `i` is equal to `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `res = input()` takes a new input string from the user and assigns it to the variable `res`. The values of `maxi` and `i` remain unchanged from their previous values, which are `i + 1` and `i + 1` respectively.
