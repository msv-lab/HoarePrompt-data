Output State: **`res` is the input string provided by the user, `maxi` is equal to `i`, `i` is `i + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `maxi = i` assigns the current value of `i` to `maxi`. The initial state indicates that `maxi` is equal to `i` if `res` is equal to `<`, and `i` is `i + 1`. After executing the code, `maxi` is updated to the current value of `i`, and `i` is incremented by 1.
