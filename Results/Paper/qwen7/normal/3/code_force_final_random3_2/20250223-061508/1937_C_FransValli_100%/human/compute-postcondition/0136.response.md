Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Initial State: 
   - `mini` is equal to `arr[1]`
   - `item` is `arr[1]`

2. The `print` statement is: `print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)`

3. Since both `mini` and `item` are equal to `arr[1]`, we need to determine the value of `arr[1]`.

4. However, the initial state does not explicitly define the value of `arr[1]`. Therefore, we can only describe it in terms of the list `arr`.

5. Given the format requirement, we will describe the output as follows:

Output: **'? [arr[1]] [arr[1]] [arr[1]] [arr[1]]'**
