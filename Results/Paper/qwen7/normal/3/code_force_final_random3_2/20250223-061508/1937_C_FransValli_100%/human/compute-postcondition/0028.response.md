Output State: **`arr` is [0, 0], `n` must be at least 1, `maxi` is 0, `res` is an input string, and the current value of `res` is equal to '<'**.

Explanation: The code `arr = [i]` updates the list `arr` to contain only the element `i`. Given the initial state where `arr` is `[0]`, the code changes `arr` to `[0]` and then reassigns `arr` to `[i]`, which is effectively `[0]` again since `i` is not defined elsewhere in the snippet and is likely meant to be the same as the initial element. However, if we interpret `i` as a new element, the updated `arr` would be `[0, i]`. Since `i` is not specified further, we assume it remains `0`, resulting in `arr` being `[0, 0]`. The other variables (`n`, `maxi`, and `res`) remain unchanged.
