You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

There is a secret sequence p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} , which is a permutation
of \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} .

You need to find any two indices i and j such that p_i \oplus p_j is
maximized, where \oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

To do this, you can ask queries. Each query has the following form: you pick arbitrary indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d < n ). Next, the jury calculates x = (p_a \mid p_b) and y = (p_c \mid p_d) , where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). Finally, you receive the result of comparison between x and y . In other words, you are told if x < y , x > y , or x = y .

Please find any two indices i and j (0 \le i,j < n ) such that p_i \oplus p_j
is maximum among all such pairs, using at most 3n queries. If there are
multiple pairs of indices satisfying the condition, you may output any one of
them.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The description of the test cases follows.

Interaction

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).
At this moment, the permutation p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} is chosen. The
interactor in this task is not adaptive. In other words, the sequence p is
fixed in every test case and does not change during the interaction.

To ask a query, you need to pick four indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d
< n ) and print the line of the following form:

  * "? a b c d" 

After that, you receive:

  * "<" if (p_a \mid p_b) < (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * "=" if (p_a \mid p_b) = (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * ">" if (p_a \mid p_b) > (p_c \mid p_d) . 

You can make at most 3n queries of this form.

Next, if your program has found a pair of indices i and j (0 \le i, j < n )
such that p_i \oplus p_j is maximized, print the line of the following form:

  * "! i j" 

Note that this line is not considered a query and is not taken into account
when counting the number of queries asked.

After this, proceed to the next test case.

If you make more than 3n queries during an interaction, your program must
terminate immediately, and you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.
Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will
continue to read from a closed stream.

After printing a query or the answer for a test case, do not forget to output
the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get the verdict
Idleness Limit Exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see the documentation for other languages. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4 .

Hacks

To hack, follow the test format below.

The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_0,p_1,\ldots,p_{n-1} ,
which represent a permutation of integers from 0 to n - 1 .

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .

Example

Input

    2
    4
    
    <
    
    =
    
    >
    
    2
    
Output

    ? 0 2 3 1
    
    ? 1 1 2 3
    
    ? 1 2 0 3
    
    ! 3 2
    
    ! 0 1
    
Note

In the first test case, the hidden permutation is p=[0,3,1,2] .

For the query "? 0 2 3 1", the jury return "<" because (p_0 \mid p_2) = (0
\mid 1) =1 < (p_3 \mid p_1) = (2 \mid 3) = 3 .

For the query "? 1 1 2 3", the jury return "=" because (p_1 \mid p_1) = (3\mid
3)= 3 = (p_2 \mid p_3) = (1 \mid 2)=3 .

For the query "? 1 2 0 3", the jury return ">" because (p_1 \mid p_2) = (3
\mid 1) = 3 > (p_0 \mid p_3) = (0\mid 2)=2 .

The answer i = 3 and j = 2 is valid: (p_3 \oplus p_2) = (2 \oplus 1) = 3 is
indeed equal to the maximum possible value of p_i \oplus p_j . Another valid
answer would be i=0 and j=1 . As the number of queries does not exceed 3n=12 ,
the answer is considered correct.

In the second test case, n = 2 , so p is either [0, 1] or [1, 0] . In any
case, p_0 \oplus p_1 = 1 is maximum possible.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        maxi = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '<':
                maxi = i
        arr = [0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '<':
                arr = [i]
            elif res == '=':
                arr.append(i)
        mini = arr[0]
        for item in arr[1:]:
            print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '>':
                mini = item
        print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)



- Function Summary: 
The function interacts with an external permutation of numbers from 0 to n-1. It makes up to 3n queries comparing bitwise OR operations on pairs of elements in the permutation. After identifying the indices i and j that maximize the bitwise XOR operation \( p_i \oplus p_j \), it prints the result as "! i j".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the permutation `n`.

2. **Finding the Maximum XOR Pair:**
   - The program initializes `maxi` to 0, assuming the maximum XOR value starts with the first element.
   - It iterates through the elements from index 1 to `n-1` to find the element with the highest possible XOR with the first element (`0`).
     - For each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, it compares `(p[maxi] | p[i])` with itself.
     - If the result is `<`, it updates `maxi` to `i`.
   - This ensures that `maxi` holds the index of the element that gives the highest possible XOR with `0`.

3. **Refining the Search:**
   - The program creates an array `arr` containing only the element at index `maxi` initially.
   - It then iterates through the remaining elements to refine the search for the maximum XOR pair.
     - For each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, it compares `(p[maxi] | p[i])` with itself.
     - If the result is `<`, it updates `arr` to contain only the current element `i`.
     - If the result is `=`, it appends the current element `i` to `arr`.
   - This ensures that `arr` contains elements that give the highest possible XOR with `maxi`.

4. **Final Comparison and Output:**
   - The program performs a final comparison to ensure that the element in `arr` with the smallest index gives the maximum XOR with `maxi`.
     - It iterates through the elements in `arr` and compares `(p[mini] | p[item])` with itself.
     - If the result is `>`, it updates `mini` to `item`.
   - Finally, it prints the indices `maxi` and `mini` as the solution.

### Correctness Check

- **Finding the Maximum XOR with `0`:**
  - The initial loop correctly identifies the element with the highest XOR value when paired with `0`. This is necessary but not sufficient to find the overall maximum XOR pair.

- **Refining the Search:**
  - The refinement process is flawed. It only considers elements that give the same XOR value as `maxi` with `0`, which might not necessarily lead to the maximum XOR pair overall. For example, if `maxi` is `2` and the permutation is `[0, 1, 3, 2]`, the refinement process might incorrectly narrow down the candidates without considering other potential high XOR values.

- **Final Comparison:**
  - The final comparison is also flawed. It only checks if the XOR with `mini` is greater than itself, which does not guarantee finding the maximum XOR pair.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly identify the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
