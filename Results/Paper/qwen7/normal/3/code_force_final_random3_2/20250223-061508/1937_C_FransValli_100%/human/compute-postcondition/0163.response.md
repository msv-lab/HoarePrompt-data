Output State: **`res` is the input string provided by the user, and the value of `res` is equal to '<', `maxi` is equal to `i`.**

Explanation: The code `maxi = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `maxi`. Since the initial value of `res` is not affected by this line of code, it remains as the input string provided by the user, which is '<'. The value of `maxi` is now equal to `i`, but since `i` was not defined before, we keep it in terms of `i`.
