Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but interacts with an external permutation \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \) of \(\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\}\). It can make up to 3n queries of the form "? a b c d" to compare bitwise OR operations on pairs of elements in the permutation. After determining the indices \(i\) and \(j\) that maximize \( p_i \oplus p_j \), it prints "! i j" to indicate the result.**
