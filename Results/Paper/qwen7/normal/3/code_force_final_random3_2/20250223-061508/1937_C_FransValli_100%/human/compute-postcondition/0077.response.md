Output State: **arr is [i+2, i+1], mini is i+1, item is i+1, res is '>', n is at least i + 2.**

In this final output state, after all iterations of the loop have executed, the list `arr` remains unchanged as `[i+2, i+1]`. The variable `mini` is set to `i+1` because it was updated to `i+1` during the last iteration when `res` was `'>'`. The variable `item` is `i+1` because the loop iterates over the second element of `arr` (which is `i+1`) in each iteration, and since there are at least `i+2` elements in `n`, the loop will run until `arr` is exhausted, which means `item` will be `i+1` in the last iteration. The variable `res` is `'>'` because it was set to `'>'` in the last iteration of the loop. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the loop.
