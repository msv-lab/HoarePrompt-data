Output State: **`res` is the final input string provided by the user after the loop has executed all its iterations, `maxi` is equal to `n-1`, and `i` is equal to `n-1`; `arr` is a list containing only one element which is 0.**

Explanation: The provided code initializes an array `arr` with a single element `0`. The loop and the conditions related to updating `maxi` and `i` are not present in the given code snippet, so the values of `maxi` and `i` remain as they were in the initial state. The variable `res` and `mini` and `item` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the provided code.
