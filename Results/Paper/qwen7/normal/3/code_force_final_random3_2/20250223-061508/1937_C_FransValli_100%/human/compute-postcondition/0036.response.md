Postcondition: `arr` is [0, i], `n` is at least 1, `maxi` is 0, `res` is an input string. If `res` is equal to '<', then `arr` becomes [0, 0]. If `res` is not equal to '<' and equals '=', then `res` remains unchanged. If `res` is neither '<' nor '=', then `arr` becomes [0, i] where `i` is some integer value.
