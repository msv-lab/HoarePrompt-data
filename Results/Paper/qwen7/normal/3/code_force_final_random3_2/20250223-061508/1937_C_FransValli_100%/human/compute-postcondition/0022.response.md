Output State: **The loop will terminate when `i` reaches `n`. At this point, `i` will be equal to `n`, and `maxi` will be the maximum value of `i` that was assigned when `res` was '<' during any iteration of the loop. If `res` was never '<', then `maxi` will remain 0.**

In simpler terms, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the variable `i` will hold the value of the last iteration (which is `n`), and `maxi` will be the highest value of `i` that was assigned to `maxi` whenever `res` was '<'. If `res` was never '<', then `maxi` will still be 0.
