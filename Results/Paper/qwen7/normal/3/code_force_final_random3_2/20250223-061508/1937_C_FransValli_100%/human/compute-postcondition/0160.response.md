Based on the initial state provided, the variables and objects mentioned in the print statement are not explicitly defined with specific values. Therefore, we need to interpret the print statement with the given variables:

- `maxi` is a variable whose value is not specified.
- `i` is also a variable whose value is not specified.
- The string `'?'` is a literal string.

Given this, the print statement will output the string `'?'` followed by the value of `maxi` twice, followed by the value of `i` twice. 

Output: **'? [maxi] [maxi] [i] [i]' (where `[maxi]` is the value of the variable `maxi` and `[i]` is the value of the variable `i`)**
