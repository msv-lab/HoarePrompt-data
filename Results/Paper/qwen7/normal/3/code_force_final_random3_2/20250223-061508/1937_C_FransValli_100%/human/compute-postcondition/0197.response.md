Output State: **`res` is a new input string from the user, `maxi` is equal to `n-1`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `arr` is a list containing `[i]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `arr = [i]` updates the list `arr` to contain the single element `[i]`. The values of `res`, `maxi`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states.
