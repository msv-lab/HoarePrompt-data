Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly given as 2.
- `n` is greater than 2 but its exact value is not specified.
- `res` is an input string, but its specific value is not given.
- If the current value of `res` is equal to '<', then `maxi` is 1. Since the exact value of `res` is not provided, we cannot determine the value of `maxi`.

Given this, the print statement will output a string with placeholders for the values of `maxi` and `i`. Since `i` is explicitly given as 2 and `maxi` is either 1 (if `res` is '<') or undefined (if `res` is not '<'), we will consider both cases.

However, since the exact value of `res` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the given information.

Output: **'? 1 1 2 2' (if res == '<') or '? undefined undefined 2 2' (if res != '<')**
