Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the placeholder `_` (which is typically used when the loop variable is not needed) and the value of `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `int(input())` is greater than 0. After each iteration, the value of `int(input())` decreases by 1.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `mini` is equal to `arr[n-1]`.
   - `item` is `arr[n-1]`.
   - `res` is an input string.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - The loop will execute one more time if `int(input())` is still greater than 0.
   - After the next iteration, `int(input())` will decrease by 1.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop condition depends on `int(input())`, we need to ensure that `int(input())` is still greater than 0.
   - The values of `mini`, `item`, and `res` remain unchanged unless the loop body modifies them, but since the loop body is omitted, we assume these values stay the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`mini` is equal to `arr[n-1]`, `item` is `arr[n-1]`, and `res` is an input string, and `int(input())` must be greater than 0**.
