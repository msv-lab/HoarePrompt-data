Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(1, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 1 at the start of the loop.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 1, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state before the loop should be adjusted to reflect these conditions.

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
