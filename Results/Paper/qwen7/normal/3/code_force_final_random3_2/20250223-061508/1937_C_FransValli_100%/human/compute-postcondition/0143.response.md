Step-by-step reasoning:

1. From the initial state, we know:
   - `mini` is equal to `arr[1]`
   - `item` is `arr[2]`

2. The `print` statement is:
   ```
   print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
   ```

3. We need to determine the values of `mini` and `item`:
   - Since `mini` is `arr[1]`, and `item` is `arr[2]`, we need to look at the list `arr` from the initial state.
   - The list `arr` contains the elements: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

4. Therefore:
   - `mini` is `arr[1]`, which is `2`
   - `item` is `arr[2]`, which is `3`

5. Substituting these values into the `print` statement:
   ```
   print('?', 2, 2, 3, 3, flush=True)
   ```

6. The `flush=True` parameter ensures that the output is immediately flushed to the standard output, but it does not change the content of what is printed.

Final output:
Output: **? 2 2 3 3**
