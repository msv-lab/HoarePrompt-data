Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `arr` is a list containing `[i+2, i+1]`.
   - `mini` is `i+1`.
   - `item` is `i+1`.
   - `res` is `'>'`.
   - `n` is at least `i + 2`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)
   ```

From the initial state, we know:
- `mini` is `i+1`.
- Since `mini` is already explicitly given as `i+1`, we can directly use this value.

However, the value of `maxi` is not explicitly given. Given that `arr` is `[i+2, i+1]`, the maximum value in the list `arr` would be `i+2` (since `i+2` is greater than `i+1`).

Therefore, the print statement will output:
Output: **! i+2 i+1**
