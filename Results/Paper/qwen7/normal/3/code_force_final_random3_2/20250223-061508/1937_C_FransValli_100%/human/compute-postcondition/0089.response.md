Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `res` is an input string.
   - If the current value of `res` is equal to '<', then `maxi` is 1.

4. **Determine the Next State**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and the loop condition is `i < n`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than 2 (since `i` is now 2).

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 2.
   - `n` must remain greater than 2.

6. **Other Variables**:
   - `res` and `maxi` are not part of the loop head, so their values do not change for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `res` is an input string, and if the current value of `res` is equal to '<', then `maxi` is 1**.
