Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes two integers, `t` and `x`, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and `x` is an integer between 2 and 1000 inclusive. The function does not return any value directly but seems to perform some operations based on these inputs.**
