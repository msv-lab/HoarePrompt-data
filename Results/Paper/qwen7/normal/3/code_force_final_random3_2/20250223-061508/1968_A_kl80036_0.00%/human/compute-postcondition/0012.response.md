Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `i` is 999 (since the loop runs from `range(int(input()))`, which means it runs `t` times), `x` is an input integer, and `y` is `x // 2` for the last iteration.

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will still be within the range of 1 to 1000, `i` will be equal to `t - 1` (since the loop starts from 0 and runs `t` times), `x` will be the last integer input provided, and `y` will be the result of dividing `x` by 2 using integer division.
