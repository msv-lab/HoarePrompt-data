Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). This value does not affect the print statement directly.
- `i` is 1. This value also does not affect the print statement directly.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `y` is assigned the value of `x // 2`.

The print statement `print(y)` will output the value of `y`, which is `x // 2`.

Output: **x // 2 (where x is the input integer)**
