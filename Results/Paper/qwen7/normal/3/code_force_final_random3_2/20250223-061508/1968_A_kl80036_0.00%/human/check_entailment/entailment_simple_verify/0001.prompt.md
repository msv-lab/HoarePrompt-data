You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x // 2
        print(y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x // 2
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `i` is 999 (since the loop runs from `i` in `range(int(input()))`, and `range(n)` generates numbers from 0 to \(n-1\)), `x` is an input integer, and `y` is `x // 2` for the last input value of `x`.
    #
    #In this final state, the loop has executed 1000 times (from `i=0` to `i=999`). The variable `t` remains within its initial constraint, `i` is set to 999 as it is the last iteration of the loop, `x` holds the value of the last input integer processed by the loop, and `y` is the result of dividing `x` by 2 using integer division.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - It then processes each test case by reading the value of `x`.

2. **Finding `y`:**
   - The program calculates `y` as `x // 2`, which means it divides `x` by 2 using integer division.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `y` for each test case.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find an integer `y` such that \(1 \leq y < x\) and \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized.
- If multiple `y` values satisfy this condition, any one can be chosen.

### Testing with Examples:

1. **Test Case: `x = 10`**
   - Possible values for `y` are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
   - Let's check the values:
     - \(\gcd(10, 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2\)
     - \(\gcd(10, 2) + 2 = 2 + 2 = 4\)
     - \(\gcd(10, 3) + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4\)
     - \(\gcd(10, 4) + 4 = 2 + 4 = 6\)
     - \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10\)
   - The maximum value is achieved when \(y = 5\).

2. **Test Case: `x = 7`**
   - Possible values for `y` are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
   - Let's check the values:
     - \(\gcd(7, 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2\)
     - \(\gcd(7, 2) + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3\)
     - \(\gcd(7, 3) + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4\)
     - \(\gcd(7, 4) + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5\)
     - \(\gcd(7, 5) + 5 = 1 + 5 = 6\)
     - \(\gcd(7, 6) + 6 = 1 + 6 = 7\)
   - The maximum value is achieved when \(y = 6\).

3. **Test Case: `x = 21`**
   - Possible values for `y` are 1, 2, 3, ..., 20.
   - Let's check the values:
     - \(\gcd(21, 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2\)
     - \(\gcd(21, 2) + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3\)
     - \(\gcd(21, 3) + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6\)
     - \(\gcd(21, 4) + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5\)
     - \(\gcd(21, 5) + 5 = 1 + 5 = 6\)
     - \(\gcd(21, 6) + 6 = 3 + 6 = 9\)
     - \(\gcd(21, 7) + 7 = 7 + 7 = 14\)
     - \(\gcd(21, 8) + 8 = 1 + 8 = 9\)
     - \(\gcd(21, 9) + 9 = 3 + 9 = 12\)
     - \(\gcd(21, 10) + 10 = 1 + 10 = 11\)
     - \(\gcd(21, 11) + 11 = 1 + 11 = 12\)
     - \(\gcd(21, 12) + 12 = 3 + 12 = 15\)
     - \(\gcd(21, 13) + 13 = 1 + 13 = 14\)
     - \(\gcd(21, 14) + 14 = 7 + 14 = 21\)
     - \(\gcd(21, 15) + 15 = 3 + 15 = 18\)
     - \(\gcd(21, 16) + 16 = 1 + 16 = 17\)
     - \(\gcd(21, 17) + 17 = 1 + 17 = 18\)
     - \(\gcd(21, 18) + 18 = 3 + 18 = 21\)
     - \(\gcd(21, 19) + 19 = 1 + 19 = 20\)
     - \(\gcd(21, 20) + 20 = 1 + 20 = 21\)
   - The maximum value is achieved when \(y = 14\), \(y = 18\), or \(y = 21\). Since \(y < x\), we choose \(y = 18\).

### Conclusion:
The program always calculates `y` as `x // 2`. This does not necessarily maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\). For instance, for \(x = 21\), the maximum value is achieved with \(y = 18\), but the program outputs \(y = 10\).

Therefore, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
