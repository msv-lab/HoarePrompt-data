Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game as described. Specifically, the program does not account for the optimal strategies of both Alice and Bob. The function `func_1` attempts to count how many unique elements are present in the array `a` and returns the smallest non-negative integer that is not present among these unique elements. However, this approach does not consider the turns taken by Alice and Bob and their respective goals.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
2
1 1
```

Expected Output:
```
2
1
0
```

However, the provided program will output:
```
1
1
0
```

For the first test case, the correct sequence of moves would be:
1. Alice picks 1, so `a = [0, 0]` and `c = [1]`.
2. Bob picks 0, so `a = [0]` and `c = [1]`.
3. Alice picks 0, so `a = []` and `c = [1, 0]`.

The MEX of `[1, 0]` is 2, but the program incorrectly outputs 1.

This discrepancy shows that the program does not correctly simulate the optimal play of both players, hence the correctness is **False**.
