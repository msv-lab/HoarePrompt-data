Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, N is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and a is a list of N non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i < N.**

The code `N = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `N`. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged, and the list `a` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, `t` retains its original condition as a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4, and `N` is set to the input integer which is also within the specified range.
