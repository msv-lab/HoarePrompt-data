Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, playing a game on an array `a` of size `n`. Alice aims to maximize the MEX of her resulting array `c`, while Bob aims to minimize it. The game alternates between Alice and Bob, with Alice always picking an element from `a` and appending it to `c`, and Bob deleting the chosen element from `a`. The game ends when `a` is empty, and the MEX of `c` is calculated at the end.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` processes the input and calculates the MEX of the array `c` that Alice can achieve.
   - It uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each number in the array `a`.
   - It iterates through the range `[0, N]` and checks the counts in the dictionary `cnt` to determine the MEX.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The function correctly initializes the count of each number in `a` using a `defaultdict`.
   - It then iterates through the range `[0, N]` to check the counts. If any number appears exactly once (`cnt[i] == 1`), it increments `t`.
   - If `t` reaches 2 or if a number is missing (`cnt[i] == 0`), it returns `i`.

4. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice can ensure that the MEX is maximized by making sure that numbers from 0 to some point are covered in `c` while minimizing the coverage of higher numbers.
   - The function correctly identifies the first number that cannot be included in `c` due to its count being 0 or the count of numbers already included reaching 2.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases like when all numbers are distinct or when there are duplicates.
   - It ensures that the MEX is calculated correctly based on the counts of numbers in `a`.

Given the analysis, the function `func_1()` correctly implements the logic to find the optimal MEX value for the given game scenario.

Correctness: **True**
