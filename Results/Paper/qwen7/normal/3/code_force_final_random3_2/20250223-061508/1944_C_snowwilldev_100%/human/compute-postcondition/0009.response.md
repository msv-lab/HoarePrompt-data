Output State: The loop has executed N times, so `i` is N-1. The variable `cnt[a[i]]` for each `i` from 0 to N-1 has been incremented according to the values in the list `a`. Therefore, `cnt` contains the count of how many times each value in `a` appears.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the dictionary `cnt` will have keys corresponding to the unique values in the list `a`, and the values associated with these keys will be the counts of how many times each value appears in the list `a`.
