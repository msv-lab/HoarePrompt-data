Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, `N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2⋅10^5, and `a` is a list of N non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i < N, where `a` is updated to a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())`.**

In this output state, the variable `t` retains its original value within the specified range, `N` remains unchanged (still an input integer within the specified range), and `a` is updated to a list of integers derived from the input split and converted to integers.
