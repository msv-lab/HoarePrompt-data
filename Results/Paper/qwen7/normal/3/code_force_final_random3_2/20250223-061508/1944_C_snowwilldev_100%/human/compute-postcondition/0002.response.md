Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, `N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2⋅10^5, `a` is a list of N non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i < N, and `cnt` is a defaultdict with all values initialized to 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a `defaultdict` named `cnt` with all values set to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `N`, or `a`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions of these variables while adding the new `cnt` variable with its default value.
