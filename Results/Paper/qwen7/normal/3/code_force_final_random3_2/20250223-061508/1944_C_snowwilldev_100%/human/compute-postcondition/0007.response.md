Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(N)`. The variables involved in the loop head are `i`.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
   - `i` is 1
   - `cnt[a[i]]` is 2 (though this variable is not directly part of the loop head, it is mentioned for context)

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `i < N`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and still satisfy the condition `i < N`.

4. **Adjusting the State**: Since `i` was 1 at the end of the previous iteration, after incrementing `i` by 1, `i` becomes 2. The new state must ensure that the loop can continue executing.

5. **Final State**: The new state should reflect that `i` is now 2 and the loop can still execute if `i < N`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 2**
