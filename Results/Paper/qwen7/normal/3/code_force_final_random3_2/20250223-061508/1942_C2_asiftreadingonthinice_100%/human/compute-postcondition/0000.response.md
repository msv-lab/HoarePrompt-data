Output State: **`tt` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which represents the number of test cases. The initial values of `n`, `x`, and `y` for each test case are yet to be inputted, and the lists of x distinct integers from 1 to n are also yet to be inputted.**

This means that the variable `tt` now holds the number of test cases, while the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the lists of integers for each test case have not been provided yet.
