Postcondition: `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `len(a)` is greater than 1, `ans` is the sum of all increments made to it within the loop, `tmp` contains all the values added to it whenever the condition `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` was met, and if `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0`, then `tmp.append((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)` has been executed.
