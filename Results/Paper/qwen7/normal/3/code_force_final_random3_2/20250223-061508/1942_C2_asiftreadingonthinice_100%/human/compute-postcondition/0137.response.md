Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` is the final value of `ans` after all iterations.
- `y` is the remaining value after all possible subtractions.
- All elements in `tmp` have been iterated over.

The print statement is:
```python
print(min(ans, n - 2))
```

To determine what will be printed, we need to understand the values of `ans` and `n - 2`.

- `ans` is the result of some iterative process, but without knowing the specific details of the iterations, we cannot determine its exact value.
- `n` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `n - 2`.

Given this information, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **min(ans, n - 2)**
