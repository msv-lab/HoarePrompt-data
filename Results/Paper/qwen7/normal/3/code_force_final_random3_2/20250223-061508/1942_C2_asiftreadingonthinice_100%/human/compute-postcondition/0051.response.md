Output State: **`tmp` is a non-empty list, y is an integer equal to its original value minus (i - 1), ans is ans + i**

Explanation: The value of `y` is decreased by `(i - 1)`. Since `y` was initially an integer greater than or equal to `i - 1`, after subtracting `(i - 1)` from `y`, `y` becomes an integer equal to its original value minus `(i - 1)`. The values of `tmp` and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
