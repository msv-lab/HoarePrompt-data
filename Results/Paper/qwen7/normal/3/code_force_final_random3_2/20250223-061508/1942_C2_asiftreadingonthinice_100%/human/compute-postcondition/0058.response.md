Output State: **`tmp` is a non-empty list with length `len(tmp) - 1`, `y` is an integer equal to `y - (i - 1)`, and `ans` is increased by `i`.**

Explanation: The variable `y` is decremented by the value of `i - 1`. The value of `ans` was previously increased by `i`, and the length of `tmp` remains unchanged.
