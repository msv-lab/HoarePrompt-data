Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers
   - If the difference between the first two elements of `a` is exactly 2, then `ans` is set to 1.
   - If the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even (but not necessarily 2), then `tmp` contains the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`.
   - The list `a` and the variable `i` remain unchanged.

2. **Loop Head Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `len(a)`.
   - The loop variable `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

4. **Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(a)`.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 2.
   - The list `a` remains unchanged.
   - The variable `i` is updated to 2.

6. **Final State:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers (unchanged)
   - `ans` and `tmp` remain as they were after the previous iteration (since no specific changes are mentioned for these variables in the loop body).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is as it was, `tmp` is as it was.**
