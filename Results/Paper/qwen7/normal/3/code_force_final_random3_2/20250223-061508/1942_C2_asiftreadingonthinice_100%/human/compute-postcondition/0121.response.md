Output State: **`i` is the first element of `tmp`, `y` is less than `i - 1` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block explicitly mentioned, the `break` statement indicates that we are breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. The values of `i` and `y` remain unchanged as the `break` statement does not modify any variables.
