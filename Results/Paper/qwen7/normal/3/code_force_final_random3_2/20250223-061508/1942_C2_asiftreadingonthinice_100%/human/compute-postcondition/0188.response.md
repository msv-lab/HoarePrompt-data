Output State: **`ans` is increased by `i`, `tmp` must contain the appropriate values based on the conditions described, `y` is equal to `i - 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `y` is decremented by `i - 1`. Given that `y` was initially greater than or equal to `i - 1`, after subtracting `i - 1` from `y`, `y` will now be exactly equal to `i - 1`. The values of `ans` and `tmp` remain unchanged from their initial state.
