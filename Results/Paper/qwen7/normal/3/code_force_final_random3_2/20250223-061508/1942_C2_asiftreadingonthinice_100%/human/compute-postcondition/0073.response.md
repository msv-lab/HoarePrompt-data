Output State: **`tmp` is an empty list, `y` is an integer, `ans` is the final accumulated value of `ans + y`, `ii` is `ii + 1`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `n` is the first integer input, `x` is the second integer input, `y` is the third integer input.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`. The other variables (`tmp`, `ans`, `ii`, `n`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
