Output State: **`tt` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `ii` is 0 and must be less than `tt`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y` respectively. The initial state of `tt` and `ii` remains unchanged. Therefore, `tt` is still an integer representing the number of test cases, and `ii` is still 0 and must be less than `tt`.
