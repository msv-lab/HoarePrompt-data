Postcondition: `i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, and the difference between the first two elements of `a` is not equal to 2. If the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is even, then `tmp` contains the value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`. If the difference is not even, no changes are made to `tmp`.
