Output State: **Postcondition: `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `len(a)` is greater than 1, `ans` is the sum of all increments made to it within the loop, and `tmp` contains all the values added to it whenever the condition `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0` was met.**

In more detail:
- The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = len(a) - 1`.
- For each iteration, if `a[i] - a[i - 1]` equals 2, `ans` is incremented by 1.
- If `a[i] - a[i - 1]` is even but not 2, the value of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` is appended to `tmp`.
- After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `len(a)`, as the loop increments `i` until it reaches the length of the list `a`.
- `ans` will contain the total number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` was exactly 2.
- `tmp` will contain all the half-values of differences between consecutive elements in `a` that were even but not 2.
