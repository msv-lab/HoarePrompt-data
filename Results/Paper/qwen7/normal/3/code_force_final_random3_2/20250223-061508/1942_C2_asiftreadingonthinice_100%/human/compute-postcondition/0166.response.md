Output State: **`i` is 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged, `tmp` is unchanged or contains the value `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2` if `(a[3] - a[2]) % 2 == 0`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)` appends the value of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to the list `tmp`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3, so `a[i]` refers to `a[3]` and `a[i - 1]` refers to `a[2]`. However, since `tmp` is only being appended to and no new value is assigned to `tmp` itself, `tmp` retains its previous state unless it was empty and now contains the calculated value. The values of `i`, `a`, `ans`, and `tmp` are updated as described.
