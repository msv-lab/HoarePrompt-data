Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `i` is the first element of `tmp`.
  - If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, then `ans` is increased by `i` and `y` is decreased by `i - 1`.
  - If `y` is less than `i - 1`, then `y` remains unchanged and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

- **Loop statement:**
  ```python
  for i in tmp:
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` is taken from the list `tmp`.

2. **Determine the Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be the next element in `tmp`.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since `i` is the next element in `tmp`, we need to set `i` to the next element in `tmp`.
   - The other variables (`ans` and `y`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head and their values are not directly modified by the loop itself (they might change inside the loop body, but we are focusing on the loop head).

### Conclusion:
- The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we need to update `i` to the next element in `tmp`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is the next element in `tmp`, `ans` is unchanged, `y` is unchanged**
