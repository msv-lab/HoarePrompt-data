Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data consisting of multiple test cases. Each test case includes three integers n, x, and y, followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n. The function returns a value based on the conditions specified for each test case.**

- For each test case, the function checks if the given integers n, x, and y meet the specified constraints.
- It then processes the x distinct integers provided in each test case.
- Based on the processed data and the given constraints, the function returns a specific value for each test case.
