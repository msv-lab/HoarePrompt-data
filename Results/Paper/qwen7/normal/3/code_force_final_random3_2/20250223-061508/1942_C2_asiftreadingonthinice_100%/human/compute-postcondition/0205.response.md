Output State: **All elements in `tmp` have been processed by the loop, and `ans` contains the sum of all `i` values where `y` was greater than or equal to `i - 1` during each iteration. `y` is set to 0 at the end of the loop.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `tmp` will no longer contain any elements since they have all been processed. The variable `ans` will hold the cumulative sum of all `i` values that satisfied the condition `y >= i - 1` during each iteration of the loop. The variable `y` will be reset to 0 after the last iteration of the loop.
