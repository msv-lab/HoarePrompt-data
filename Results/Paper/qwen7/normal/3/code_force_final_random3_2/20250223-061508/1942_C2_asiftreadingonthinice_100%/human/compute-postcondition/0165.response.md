Output State: **`i` is 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is increased by 1, and `tmp` is either unchanged or contains the value `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2` if `(a[3] - a[2]) % 2 == 0`.**

Explanation: The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. The other variables (`i`, `a`, and `tmp`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their states remain as they were in the initial state.
