Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum profit. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Use of Binary Search**: The program uses binary search to find an optimal value of `k`. However, the condition inside the binary search loop (`func_1(mid, a, b, n)`) checks if the total profit is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`, which is not relevant to finding the maximum profit. Instead, we need to maximize the profit, not check if it's within a certain limit.

2. **Profit Calculation in `func_1`**: The function `func_1` calculates the profit as `k * b + (n - k) * a` and returns `True` if this profit is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`. This is incorrect because we should be maximizing the profit, not checking if it fits within an arbitrary limit.

3. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic is flawed. The binary search should aim to maximize the profit by adjusting `k` based on whether the current profit is higher or lower than the best found so far.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
