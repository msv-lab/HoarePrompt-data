Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the profit by choosing an optimal `k` (number of buns sold at a modified price). The modified price for the `i-th` bun is `(b - i + 1)` coins. The remaining buns are sold at the usual price `a` coins each.

2. **Binary Search Approach**: The given program uses binary search to find the optimal `k`. However, the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the profit. Instead, it checks if the total profit is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements.

3. **Correct Profit Calculation**: The correct way to calculate the profit would be to compute the sum of the modified prices for the first `k` buns and the usual prices for the remaining `n - k` buns.

4. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search should find the maximum `k` such that the profit is maximized. The current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly reflect this logic.

5. **Revised Function**: We need to revise `func_1` to correctly calculate the profit for a given `k` and check if it is greater than the current best profit.

Given these points, the provided program is incorrect because the `func_1` function does not correctly calculate the profit and the binary search logic is flawed.

Correctness: **False**
