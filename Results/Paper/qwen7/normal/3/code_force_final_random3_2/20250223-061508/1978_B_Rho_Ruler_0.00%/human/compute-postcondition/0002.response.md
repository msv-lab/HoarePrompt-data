Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `ans` is `ans + (n - k) * a`, and `n`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `ans` by adding `(n - k) * a` to its current value. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `k`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
