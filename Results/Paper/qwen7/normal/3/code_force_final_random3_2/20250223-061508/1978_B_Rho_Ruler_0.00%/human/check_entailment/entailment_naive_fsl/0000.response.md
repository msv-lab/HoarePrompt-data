Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the maximum profit. The program attempts to use binary search to find the optimal value of \( k \), but the logic within the `func_1` function is flawed. Specifically, the condition `ans <= n * max(a, b)` is incorrect because it does not accurately reflect the profit calculation.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:
- Input: `n = 4`, `a = 4`, `b = 5`
- Expected output: `17`

However, the program will not produce the correct result. Let's break down why:

1. The program uses binary search to find the optimal \( k \). However, the condition in `func_1` is incorrect and does not properly evaluate the profit for different values of \( k \).

2. For \( n = 4 \), \( a = 4 \), and \( b = 5 \):
   - If \( k = 1 \): Profit = \( 5 + 4 \times 3 = 17 \)
   - If \( k = 2 \): Profit = \( 4 + 3 + 4 \times 2 = 14 \)
   - If \( k = 3 \): Profit = \( 3 + 2 + 1 + 4 \times 1 = 10 \)
   - If \( k = 4 \): Profit = \( 2 + 1 + 4 \times 0 = 2 \)

The optimal \( k \) is 1, which gives a profit of 17 coins. However, the program's binary search approach does not correctly identify this.

Since the program does not correctly calculate the maximum profit for the given test case, the correctness is **False**.
