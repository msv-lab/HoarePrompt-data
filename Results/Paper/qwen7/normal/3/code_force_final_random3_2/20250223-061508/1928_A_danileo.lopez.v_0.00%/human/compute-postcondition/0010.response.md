The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`. The loop will continue as long as `t` is a positive integer. At the end of the previous iteration, the postcondition states that `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `_` is 1, `a` is an integer from input, and `b` is an integer from input. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be a positive integer within the specified range. Since `_` is incremented by 1 each iteration and starts at 1, it will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `t` remains a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\).

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `_` is 2, `a` is an integer from input, `b` is an integer from input**
