The function processes multiple test cases, each containing two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each test case, it checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even. If at least one of them is even, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. After processing all test cases, the function ends without returning any value.
