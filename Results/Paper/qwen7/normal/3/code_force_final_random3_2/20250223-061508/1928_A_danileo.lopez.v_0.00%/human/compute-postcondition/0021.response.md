Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `_` is equal to the total number of iterations (which is `t`), `a` is the last input integer, and `b` is the second last input integer.**

This means that after the loop completes all its iterations, the variable `t` retains its initial value (an integer between 1 and \(10^4\)). The variable `_` will hold the value `t`, indicating the total number of iterations executed. The variables `a` and `b` will contain the values of the last two integers provided as input during the final iteration of the loop.
