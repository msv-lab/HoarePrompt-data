Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle. Hereâ€™s the detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then processes each test case by reading the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\).
2. **Logic Implementation**: For each pair \((a, b)\), the program checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even. If at least one of them is even, it prints 'Yes', indicating that another rectangle can be formed. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.
3. **Edge Cases**: 
   - When both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, no matter how you cut the rectangle, the resulting pieces will always be odd-sized, and thus, you cannot form a new rectangle of different dimensions.
   - When at least one of \(a\) or \(b\) is even, you can always cut the rectangle into smaller pieces that can be rearranged to form a different rectangle.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic is sound and correctly implemented. The program handles all edge cases as described.

Correctness: **True**
