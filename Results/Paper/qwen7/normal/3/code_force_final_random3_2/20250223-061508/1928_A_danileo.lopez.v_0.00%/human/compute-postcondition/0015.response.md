The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), and `_` is 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 1 (since it starts at 1 and decreases by 1 each iteration). Since `_` is set to 2 at the start of each iteration, it remains 2 throughout the iterations.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\). For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 1. Therefore, `t` must be at least 2.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and \(10^4\), `_` is 2**
