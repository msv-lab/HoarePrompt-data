Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then processes each test case by reading two integers `a` and `b`, representing the dimensions of the rectangle.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if either `a` or `b` is even using the condition `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints 'Yes'.
   - If the condition is false, it prints 'No'.

3. **Problem Description Understanding:**
   - According to the problem, Bob can form another rectangle if he can cut the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then rearrange them to form a new rectangle.
   - Specifically, if either dimension of the original rectangle is even, it is possible to cut it into smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle. This is because cutting along an even dimension allows for the creation of at least one smaller rectangle with an even side, which can then be rearranged to form a new rectangle.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd, no matter how you cut the rectangle, the resulting smaller rectangles will also have odd dimensions, and thus, it is not possible to form a new rectangle (since all possible rearrangements would result in the same set of rectangles).

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Bob can form another rectangle. The condition `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0` accurately identifies when it is possible to form another rectangle.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
