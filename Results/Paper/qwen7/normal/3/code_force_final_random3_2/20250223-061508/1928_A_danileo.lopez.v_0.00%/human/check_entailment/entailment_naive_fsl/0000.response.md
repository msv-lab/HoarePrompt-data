Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program checks if either `a` or `b` is even to determine if a new rectangle can be formed. However, this logic is incomplete. According to the problem description, a rectangle can be split into two smaller rectangles, and those smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle. The current logic fails to consider the cases where both `a` and `b` are odd but still allows for the formation of a new rectangle.

For example, consider the test case `2 6`. The program would correctly output "Yes" because `2` is even. However, consider the test case `3 3`. Both dimensions are odd, but the rectangle can still be split into two `3 \times 1` rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a `1 \times 3` rectangle. The program incorrectly outputs "No" for this case.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and is thus incorrect.
