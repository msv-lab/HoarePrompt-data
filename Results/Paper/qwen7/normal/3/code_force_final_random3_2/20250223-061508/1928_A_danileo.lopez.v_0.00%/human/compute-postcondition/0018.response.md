Output: **No**

Explanation:
- The initial state describes that `t` is an integer between 2 and \(10^4\).
- `_` is explicitly given as 2.
- `a` is an input integer.
- `b` is an input integer.

The `print('No')` statement simply prints the string 'No'. Since no values of `a` or `b` are used in this print statement, and the string 'No' is directly provided, the output is exactly as written: 'No'.
