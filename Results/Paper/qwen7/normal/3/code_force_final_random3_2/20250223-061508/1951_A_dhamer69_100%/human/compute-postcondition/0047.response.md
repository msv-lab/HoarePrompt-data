Postcondition: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string from the user. If `n` equals 2, `s` is either '00' or not '00', and `count_1` remains unchanged unless specific conditions are met (i.e., `s` contains exactly one instance of '11' and `count_1` is 2, `s.count('11')` is not equal to 1, or `count_1` is not equal to 2). If `n` is not equal to 2, `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`, and `count_1` remains unchanged unless specific conditions are met (i.e., `s.count('11') == 1` and `count_1 == 2`). In both cases, `n` is updated to the value of an input integer, and `s` is updated to the new input string.**
