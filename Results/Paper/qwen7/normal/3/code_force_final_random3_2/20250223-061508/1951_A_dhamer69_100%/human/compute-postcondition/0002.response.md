Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `n` after converting it to an integer. The initial values of `start`, `end`, and `t` remain unchanged.
