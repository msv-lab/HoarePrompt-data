Postcondition: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string from the user, and if `n` equals 2, `s` is either '00' or not '00'. If `n` is not equal to 2, `count_1` is the number of times '1' appears in `s`. If `count_1` is odd, `count_1` remains unchanged. If `count_1` is even, `count_1` remains unchanged unless `s` contains exactly one instance of '11' and `count_1` is 2, `s.count('11')` is not equal to 1, or `count_1` is not equal to 2; `n` is assigned the value of an input integer, and `s` is updated to the new input string.**
