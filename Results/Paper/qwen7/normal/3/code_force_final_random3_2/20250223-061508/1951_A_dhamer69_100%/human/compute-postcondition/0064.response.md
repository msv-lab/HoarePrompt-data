Output State: `start` is an integer greater than 2, `end` is an integer, `t` is `start - 3`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string.

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, `t` will be reduced by 3 (since it starts from `start` and decreases by 1 each iteration). Therefore, `t` will be `start - 3`. The values of `start` and `end` remain unchanged as they were not modified within the loop. `n` and `s` will hold the values of the last input provided before the loop finishes.
