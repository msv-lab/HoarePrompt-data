Postcondition: **`start` is greater than 1, `end` is an integer, `t` is `start - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string. If `s` equals '00', the condition remains unchanged. If `s.count('11') == 1 and count_1 == 2`, no changes are made. If `count_1 % 2 != 0`, no changes are made. Otherwise, the condition remains unchanged.**
