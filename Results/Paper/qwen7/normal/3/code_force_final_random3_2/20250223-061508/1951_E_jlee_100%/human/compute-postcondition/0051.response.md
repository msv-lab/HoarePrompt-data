Postcondition: `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, and either the character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s`, in which case `done` is True and the most internal loop or if statement is broken, or there is no condition met and the postcondition remains as the initial state.
