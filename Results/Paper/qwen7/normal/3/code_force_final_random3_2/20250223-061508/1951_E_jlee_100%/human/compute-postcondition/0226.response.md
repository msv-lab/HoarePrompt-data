Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is `n-1`
- `n` is greater than 0
- The character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s`

The `print(string)` statement will print the string `s`.

To break it down further:
- Since `j` is `n-1`, the character at index `j` is the last character of the string `s`.
- The character at index `n - 1 - j` would be the character at index `0` (since `n - 1 - (n - 1) = 0`).

Given that these two characters are not equal, the string `s` itself remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output will be the string `s`.

Output: **s**
