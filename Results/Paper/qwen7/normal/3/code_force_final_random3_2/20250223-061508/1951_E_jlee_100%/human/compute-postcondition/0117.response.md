Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `done` is True, and `count` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `done = True` simply assigns the value `True` to the variable `done`. Since `done` was already `True` under the condition that `s[1]` is not equal to the character at index `n - 2` in string `s`, this assignment does not change its value. All other variables (`j`, `n`, and `count`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
