Postcondition: `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `count` is greater than 0, `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, and the character at index `j` in string `s` is either equal to or not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s`. Additionally, if `count` is greater than 1, then `done` equals `True`. If `count2` is less than `count`, `done` is True, and the character at index `j` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in string `s`. If `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`, `done` remains `False`.
