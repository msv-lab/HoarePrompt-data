Output State: **`done` is `True`, `count` is equal to `j`.**

Explanation: The code sets `done` to `True`. According to the initial postcondition, `done` becomes `True` only if the character at index `j` in the list `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` and `count` is less than 1. Since `done` is now set to `True`, the condition for setting `done` to `True` is satisfied, and `count` is set to `j`. Therefore, the output state is that `done` is `True` and `count` is equal to `j`.
