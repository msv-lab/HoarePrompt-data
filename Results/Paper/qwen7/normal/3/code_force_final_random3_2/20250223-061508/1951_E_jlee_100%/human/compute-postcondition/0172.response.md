Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `done` is True, `count` is 2, `count2` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `done = True` does not change the value of `done`. It simply reassigns `done` to `True`, which was already its value according to the initial state. All other variables (`j`, `n`, `count`, `count2`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
