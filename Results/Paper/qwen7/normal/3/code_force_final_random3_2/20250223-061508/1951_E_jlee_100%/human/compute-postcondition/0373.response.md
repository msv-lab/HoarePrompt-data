Output State: **`done` is `True`, `i` is `n-1`, `string` is an input string**

Explanation: The code `string = input()` reads a string from the user input and assigns it to the variable `string`. The variables `done` and `i` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `done` is still `True` and `i` is still `n-1`. The newly introduced variable `string` now holds the value of the user's input.
