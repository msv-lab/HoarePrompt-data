Output State: **`done` is `True`**.

Explanation: The given code simply assigns the value `True` to the variable `done`. There are no conditions or loops that would change the value of `done` or any other variables. Since the initial state already sets `done` to `True`, and there is no code to alter this value, `done` remains `True`.
