Given the initial state:
- `j` is 1
- `n` is greater than 0
- `done` is True if `s[1]` is not equal to the character at index `n - 2` in string `s`
- `count` is 1

We need to determine what will be printed by the statement `print(string[:j], string[j:])`.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. `j` is explicitly given as 1.
2. `string[:j]` will be the substring of `string` from the start up to index `j-1`, which is `string[0]` since `j` is 1.
3. `string[j:]` will be the substring of `string` starting from index `j`, which is `string[1:]`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the first character of `string` followed by the rest of the string.

Output: **string[0], string[1:]**
