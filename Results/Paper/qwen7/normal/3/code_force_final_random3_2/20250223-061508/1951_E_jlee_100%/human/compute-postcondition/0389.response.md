Based on the initial state provided:

- `done` remains `False`
- `i` is `n-1`
- `string` is an input string
- `s` is a list representation of the input string
- `x` is the first element of the list `s`

The condition states that if `x` is not equal to the last element of the list `s`, then the condition holds true. However, the `print('YES')` statement will execute regardless of this condition because it is always executed.

Given that the condition does not affect the execution of the `print` statement, the output will be:

Output: **YES**
