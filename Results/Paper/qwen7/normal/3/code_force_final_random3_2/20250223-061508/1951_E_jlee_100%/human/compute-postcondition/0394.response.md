Output State: **`done` remains `False`, `i` is `n-1`, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list representation of the input string, `x` is the first element of the list `s`. The loop continues without changing any variable values.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to any variables within the loop, their values remain unchanged. The condition for the loop continues to hold true as specified.
